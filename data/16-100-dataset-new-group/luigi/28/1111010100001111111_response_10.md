The buggy function `table_exists` fails to check for the existence of tables in a case-insensitive manner, causing it to return incorrect results when working with tables that are capitalized.

The buggy function logic compares the table names directly with the stdout received from the `show tables` and `show partitions` Hive commands, which can lead to case-sensitivity issues with the table names.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to make it case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
```

In the corrected version, the `table` and the `stdout` are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive match.

This change addresses the issue reported on GitHub and makes the `table_exists` function case-insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.
