The bug in the given function "table_exists" is that it is not handling the stdout properly when calling the "run_hive_cmd" function. The function is not considering the newline character in the output when checking if the table exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle the newline character in the stdout variable. We can use the "strip()" method to remove any leading/trailing whitespaces and newlines from the stdout variable before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
       
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.strip()  # Fix: use strip() to remove whitespaces and newlines
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Fix: Use bool() to directly convert stdout to a boolean value
```

This corrected version of the function uses the strip() method to remove any leading/trailing whitespaces and newlines from the stdout variable before performing the comparison. Additionally, it directly returns the boolean value of stdout using bool(), which is more concise and readable.
