The buggy function is a method called table_exists that checks whether a table exists in a Hive database. The potential error locations in the function include the usage of the run_hive_cmd function, the condition for checking the existence of the table, and the handling of the partition parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the stdout from the run_hive_cmd function and also does not correctly handle the condition for checking the existence of the table.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the run_hive_cmd function returns the stdout as expected, and we should also improve the condition for checking the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we have fixed the run_hive_cmd commands so that they correctly capture the stdout. We have also simplified the condition for checking the existence of the table and used the bool() function to handle the stdout.
