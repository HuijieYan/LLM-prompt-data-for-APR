The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the tables in the database. This causes issues when the table names are capitalized or have a different case than the names returned by Hive.

The fix for this bug is to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase (or uppercase) and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the function converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison, resolving the case insensitivity issue described in the GitHub issues.
