## The source code of the buggy function (corrected)

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By comparing the expected and actual outputs, and considering the provided bug description, the root cause can be identified. The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the function due to the comparison of table names in the test cases without considering their case. The fix for this bug involves making the comparison case insensitive.

The corrected version of the function uses the `lower()` method to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive.

The corrected version of the function should now pass all the test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue reported in GitHub about making `table_exists` case insensitive.
