The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle the case where the table name is included in the response from `run_hive_cmd`. The current implementation only checks if the response is not empty and returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. This does not accurately determine if the table exists.

To fix this, the function should split the response from `run_hive_cmd` and check if the table name is present in the result. Additionally, the function should handle the case where the table name is not found in the response.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(t.strip() == table for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version properly checks if the table name is present in the response and handles the case where the table name is not found. This should satisfy all the expected input/output values and pass the failing test cases.
