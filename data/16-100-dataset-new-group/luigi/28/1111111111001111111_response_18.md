The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the tests due to a case sensitivity issue when checking for existing tables in Hive. The issue is well-documented in GitHub as #896 and is related to the fact that Hive is case insensitive, while the `table_exists` function is currently performing a case-sensitive comparison.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should be updated to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from Hive. This can be achieved by using the `lower()` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected implementation, the `table_exists` function should now accurately identify the existence of tables in Hive, regardless of the case of their names. The updated function satisfies the expected output values and resolves the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issues.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the case insensitivity issue reported on GitHub.
