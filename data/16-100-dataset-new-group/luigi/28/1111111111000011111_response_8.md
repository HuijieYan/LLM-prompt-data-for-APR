The bug is caused by the table_exists function not being case insensitive, resulting in failed tests when the table name's case doesn't match the case of the output from the hive command.

The bug can be fixed by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and stdout to lower case before comparison, the function will now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix will resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the table_exists function not being case insensitive.
