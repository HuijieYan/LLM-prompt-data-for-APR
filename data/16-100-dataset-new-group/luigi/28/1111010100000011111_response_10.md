The buggy function is `table_exists()` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `hive.py` file. The function is intended to check if a table exists in a given database by running hive commands and analyzing the output. However, the function has a bug where it does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table names.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparison of the table name with the output of hive commands without considering case insensitivity.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of the hive command. This results in incorrect identification of table existence, especially when the table name has different cases.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to convert both the table name and the output from the hive command to lower case (or upper case) before comparison. This will allow for a case-insensitive comparison and ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists()` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version above, when checking for table existence, both the table name and the output from the hive command are converted to lower case before comparison. This allows for a case-insensitive comparison and ensures that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table. The `bool(stdout)` is used to directly return the truthiness of the `stdout` variable.
