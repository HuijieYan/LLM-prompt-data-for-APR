The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is failing due to a case sensitivity issue in the comparison. The bug is related to the comparison of the table name in the `table_exists` function. In some cases, the table name is returned in lowercase from the `hive` invocations, causing the comparison to fail.

The bug is also reflected in the failing test where the assertion error occurs when trying to check if the table exists by using a capitalized table name.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the table name is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of the table name is made case insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.

This fix ensures that the comparison is not affected by the case sensitivity issues, resolving the problem reported in the GitHub issue #896.
