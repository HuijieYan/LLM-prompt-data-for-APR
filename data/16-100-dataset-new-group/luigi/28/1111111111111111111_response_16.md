The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it is not handling case insensitivity correctly. The issue in GitHub also confirms that the function should be case insensitive, but it is not currently implemented that way.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name with the table names retrieved from Hive after converting both to lowercase. This way, the comparison will be case insensitive as required.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)"""
            % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass all the failing test cases and be case insensitive, as expected. This solution aligns with the issue and the corresponding GitHub pull request that addresses this bug.
