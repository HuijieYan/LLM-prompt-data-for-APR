The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the `stdout` value is checked and the condition for the return value when `partition` is provided. The buggy function fails the test cases because it does not handle the `stdout` value correctly in some cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition for the return value when `partition` is provided, and also handle the conditions for the `stdout` value better to accurately determine if the table exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return bool(stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(p in stdout for p in partition.values())
```

By using the `bool` function to check if `stdout` has a value and using the `any` function to check if any partition values exist in the `stdout`, we can ensure that the `table_exists` function returns the correct values for the given test cases.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
