The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the `test_table_exists` test due to case-sensitivity issues. The issue has been identified and discussed in GitHub (#896).

The cause of the bug is that the function is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the database. The buggy function does not account for the case differences between the table name and the table names returned by the `show tables` command in Hive.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison to make the existence check case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False

```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the case sensitivity issue reported in GitHub.
