Based on the error message and the GitHub issues, it seems that the bug is related to the case sensitivity of the table names while checking for table existence. The buggy function is not handling the case sensitivity properly, leading to failing tests.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the comparisons of the table names with the `stdout`. It seems that the function is not handling the case of the table name properly when comparing it with the `stdout`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence. This causes the tests to fail when comparing the expected table name with the actual table name in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, the function now handles case insensitivity properly and should pass the failing tests. This fixes the bug reported in the GitHub issues.
