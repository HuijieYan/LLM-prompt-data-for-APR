The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check whether a specified table in a given database exists, with a given partition. The function currently takes two main branches. If no partition is specified, it constructs and runs a Hive command to check if the table exists. If a partition is specified, it constructs another Hive command to also check for the existence of the partition.

The issue arises from how the 'run_hive_cmd' function is being used. The function is not being called properly. The `run_hive_cmd` is also not being imported to the buggy file, `luigi/contrib/hive.py` which leads to the function not to be recognized within the file.

The bug can be fixed by importing the 'run_hive_cmd' function to the buggy file, `luigi/contrib/hive.py`, so that it can be directly called within the `table_exists` function. Also, the condition of comparing the output can be altered a little bit.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout is not None
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1};".format(database, table))
            return partition in stdout
```
