Potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. In the `table_exists` function, where the comparison `table in stdout` may not return the expected result due to case sensitivity.
2. In the `table_exists` function, where the comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` is suggested as a fix in the GitHub issue, but not implemented in the current buggy function.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive, which may be in a different case. This causes the comparison to fail when the table name's case does not match the case of the output from Hive.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the comparison to make it case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lower case using the `lower()` method before comparing them, making the comparison case-insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue.
