## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join('{}={}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items())
            command = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(command)
            return bool(stdout)
```

The bug in the original code lies in how the `partition_spec` function was being used to compose the command to check for partition existence. The `partition_spec` function is not being used properly in the original code leading to the incorrect formation of the command.

The corrected version of the function addresses this issue by composing the command manually to check for partition existence using the provided input parameters.

The corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
