The issue identified in the buggy function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. This results in tests failing when they should be passing due to the case mismatch between the table name and the output from the Hive command.

The fix for this bug involves modifying the `table_exists` function to ensure that it performs a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` to allow for case-insensitive comparison in both cases.
2. We also use `bool(stdout)` to directly return the boolean result of whether `stdout` has any value.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function now handles case insensitivity correctly, resolving the issue that was reported on GitHub. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and prevent similar issues in the future.
