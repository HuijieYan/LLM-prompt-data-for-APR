The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison of the stdout output.

The issue is that the "table in stdout" condition checks if the entire table name is in the output, which is likely to return False in some cases due to case sensitivity, as shown in the failing tests. 

The comparison should be made with case insensitivity to match the table name correctly.

To fix the bug, update the comparison to be case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
