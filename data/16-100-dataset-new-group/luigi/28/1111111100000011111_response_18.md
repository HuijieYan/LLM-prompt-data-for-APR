The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The `table_exists` function should be case insensitive and check for the existence of the table irrespective of the case of the table name. This is needed to address the GitHub issue raised by users, where tables that are defined with capitalized names are not being correctly identified due to case sensitivity.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` with the given table name to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lower case for comparison.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is given below:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
``` 

This corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the `stdout` to lower case using the `lower()` function for comparison to make the existence check case insensitive. This modification will resolve the issue of failing checks for table existence due to case sensitivity.
