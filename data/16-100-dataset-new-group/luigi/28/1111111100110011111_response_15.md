The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity for table names. This causes the test cases to fail when the actual table name is in a different case than the expected table name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the tables returned from Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    # other functions
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name being searched for and the tables returned from Hive to lowercase, and then compare them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub issue.

With this change, the `table_exists` function will now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
