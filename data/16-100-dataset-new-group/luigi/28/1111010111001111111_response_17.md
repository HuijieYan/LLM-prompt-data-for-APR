The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is due to the failure to handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This bug has been discussed in GitHub issue #896, and Lin has suggested a fix to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, you should modify the comparison to make it case insensitive. You can do this by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing test cases provided. It will also address the GitHub issue #896 related to making `table_exists` case insensitive.
