### The bug in the original function
The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists in the database. This causes the failing test cases because it is expecting the function to be case insensitive.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The fix involves making the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them. Additionally, the `table` parameter should also be converted to lowercase before comparing with `stdout`. This strategy will ensure that the function behaves as expected in a case-insensitive manner.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, before comparing the table name and `stdout`, both strings are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, thereby fixing the bug. This version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. The issue posted on GitHub regarding the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function will also be resolved with this correction.
