The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing because it is not handling case insensitivity correctly. The GitHub issues indicate that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive because sometimes the tables are defined as capitalized, and Hive is case insensitive and will return them as lowercase.

The buggy function's logic incorrectly checks if the table name is in the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. It should compare the lower case versions of the table name and the `stdout` string.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to compare lowercase versions of the table name and the `stdout` string.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now properly handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This should resolve the failing test and satisfy the GitHub issue requests for case insensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
