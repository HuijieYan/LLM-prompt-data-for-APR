The potential error lies in the comparison of table name in the `table_exists` function. The comparison should be case insensitive to ensure that the function works with tables that may have different case formats. The bug was reported on GitHub and a suggestion for fixing it was to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. We will use the `lower()` method to transform both the table name and the string from `stdout` to lowercase, and then compare them.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now work as expected, performing a case-insensitive comparison of the table name from the `stdout` string.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and resolve the GitHub issue.
