The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the tables returned by the Hive command. This is causing the tests to fail and the inconsistency in case sensitivity. The issue has been logged in GitHub as Issue #896, and a proposed fix is to make `table_exists` case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be updated to make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue and passing the failing test cases.
