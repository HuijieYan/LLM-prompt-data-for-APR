The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does a case-sensitive check when it should be case-insensitive.

The cause of the bug is related to the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. The bug is identified in the `table_exists` function, where it directly checks if the table name exists in the output of a Hive command without accounting for case sensitivity. This causes the function to return incorrect results when the table name case does not match the case of the table name in the Hive metadata.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive. Instead of checking for an exact match between the table name and the output of the Hive command, we should convert both to lowercase and then perform the check.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected function, the check for table existence will be case-insensitive, and it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports.
