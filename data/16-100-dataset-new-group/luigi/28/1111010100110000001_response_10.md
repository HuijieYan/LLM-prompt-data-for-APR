The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not properly handle the returned value from the `run_hive_cmd` function. When the `table_exists` function is called, it checks for the presence of the table in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. The bug is likely due to the incorrect parsing of the output or incorrect comparison with the table name. 

To fix this bug, the condition for checking the presence of the table in the command output should be updated to account for the expected format of the output. Additionally, the return statements can be simplified for clarity.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function has been updated to return True or False explicitly based on the conditions. The use of f-string and the updated command format leads to clearer and simpler code. The correction should address the issue with the failing test cases.
