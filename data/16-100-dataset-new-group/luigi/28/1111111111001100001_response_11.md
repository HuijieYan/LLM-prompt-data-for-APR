The root cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not returning the correct output for the test cases. Also, the conditional logic inside the `table_exists` function does not handle the case where the `stdout` is not empty, but the table is not found in the `stdout`. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the expected values for the test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})')

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we use f-strings for string formatting and avoid unnecessary if conditionals. We also correctly handle the result of `run_hive_cmd` and return the expected results for the test cases provided.
