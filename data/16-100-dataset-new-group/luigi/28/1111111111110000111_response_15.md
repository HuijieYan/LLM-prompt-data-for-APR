From the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, it is evident that the buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case insensitivity as expected. The function is not checking the table names in a case-insensitive manner, causing the test cases for case insensitivity to fail. This issue is also reported in GitHub issue #896.

The potential error in the buggy function is at the following line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
The comparison here is case-sensitive, which causes the function to fail when checking for case insensitive table names.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be made in a case-insensitive manner. A strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase or uppercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function `table_exists`:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, the table name and the stdout are both converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, which will make the function pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
