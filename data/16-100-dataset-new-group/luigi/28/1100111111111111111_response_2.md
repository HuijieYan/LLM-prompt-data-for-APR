To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command to be case insensitive. The comparison should be made after converting both the table name and the output string to lowercase.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` string to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub topic.

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function will now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
