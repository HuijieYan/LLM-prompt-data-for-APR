The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the `run_hive_cmd` function call and its use of the `stdout` variable.

The issue arises from the fact that the `run_hive_cmd` function is returning a string with a line break at the end, and the function does not handle this correctly. When checking if the `table` is in the `stdout`, the function is not accounting for the line break, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition `table in stdout` to `table in stdout.strip()` in the first `if` statement. This will remove any trailing line breaks from the `stdout` string before the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.strip()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test.
