## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The bug causes the function to not correctly identify the existence of a table. In the case where a partition is provided, the bug in forming the hive command leads to incorrect detection. 

The bug in the `stdout` variable check causes the function to return incorrect results. Specifically, the use of `and` and `or` in the return statements can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the `stdout` variable contains the expected output, and that the return statement compares this output correctly.

## The corrected version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)  # checking if stdout has a value
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)  # checking if stdout has a value
```
In the corrected version, the function now returns `True` or `False` based on the presence of `stdout`.

The provided solution handles both cases: when `partition` is `None`, and when it is provided. Now, it checks if `stdout` has a value and returns `True` if it does, and `False` if it doesn't.
