The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not accounting for the case when there are multiple tables in the output. The function only checks if the table name is present in the stdout, but it does not consider the possibility of multiple tables being present. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True` for the second case when it should return `False` because there are multiple tables in the output.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to split the stdout by newline characters and check if the table name is in the resulting list. This ensures we accurately determine if the table exists in the database.
 
Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by the newline character and checks if the table name is in the resulting list for the case when there is no partition. For the partition case, it simply checks if `stdout` is truthy, as that is all that is needed to determine if the table exists. This fix should make the function behave as expected in all cases.
