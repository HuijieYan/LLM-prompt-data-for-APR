The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking table names against the output of the Hive command. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to failed tests and issues with table names being capitalized or in different case formats.

The bug is due to the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. The issue mentioned on GitHub is a clear indicator of this problem and suggests a potential fix by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue. We should use `table.lower()` for comparison with `stdout.lower()` to ensure a consistent case comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table name with the output of the Hive command, resolving the reported issue and fixing the bug.
