The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing it to fail when checking if a given table exists. The bug appears to be two-fold:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not being mocked properly in the tests, resulting in incorrect return values.
2. The logic of the `table_exists` function is not handling the response from `run_hive_cmd` in the correct way.

The root cause of the bug is that the return value of `run_hive_cmd` is not being set up properly in the test, leading to incorrect results being returned. Additionally, the logic in the `table_exists` function is flawed, as it does not handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` properly.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be updated to handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` correctly, and the test should be updated to correctly mock the return value of `run_hive_cmd`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        if isinstance(partition, str):
            partition = f"partition ({partition})"
        
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} {partition}")

        return bool(stdout)
```
