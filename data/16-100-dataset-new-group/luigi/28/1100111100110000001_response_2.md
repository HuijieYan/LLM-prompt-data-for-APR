The buggy function `table_exists` takes three parameters `self`, `table`, `database`, and `partition`. It checks whether a table exists in a specified database and partition. The issue with the function is that in the `if` block it should check the existence of the table in the database without partition. On the other hand, in the `else` block, it should check the existence of the table in the specified database and partition.

The bug is causing the test cases (`test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists`) to fail because the control structure within the `table_exists` function is not correctly checking for the existence of the table and its partitions.

To fix the bug, the `if` and `else` blocks should be modified to check for table existence with and without partitions appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and '{}\t{}'.format(table, partition) in stdout
```

This corrected function should now compare the existence of the table and partition as intended and resolve the issue identified in the failing test messages.
