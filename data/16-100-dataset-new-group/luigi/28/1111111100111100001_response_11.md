The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable. The function seems to check if the table name exists in the `stdout`, instead of checking for an exact match. This might lead to incorrect results in cases where the table name is a substring of another table name.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check for an exact match of the table name in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return the boolean result directly
``` 

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` on newlines and check if the table name is in the resulting list. Additionally, we return the boolean result directly from the `else` block without the need for an if-else condition.
