The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by a case-sensitivity issue. The function doesn't handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This is evident from the failing test cases and the corresponding GitHub issues.

To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lower case before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will compare the lower case version of the table name with the lower case version of the output from `run_hive_cmd`, allowing for case-insensitive table existence checks.

This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing tests.
