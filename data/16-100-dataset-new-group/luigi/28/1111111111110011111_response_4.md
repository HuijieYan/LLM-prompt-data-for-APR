The bug in the `table_exists` function in `HiveCommandClient` from the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. This causes the test to fail with an `AssertionError` when trying to check for a table that has different cases.

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class should be updated to handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive. This change will make the comparison case insensitive, ensuring that tables with different cases are correctly detected.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    ...

    # Corrected version of the table_exists function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue posted on GitHub regarding making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
