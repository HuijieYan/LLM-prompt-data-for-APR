Based on the error message and the GitHub issues, the bug in the `table_exists` method is due to case sensitivity. The method is not handling the case where the table name is capitalized, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` method to be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By using the `lower()` method on both `table` and `stdout`, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive. This correction will make the `table_exists` method work correctly with both capitalized and lowercase table names.
