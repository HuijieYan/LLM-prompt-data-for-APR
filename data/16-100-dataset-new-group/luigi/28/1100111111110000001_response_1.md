*Potential Error Locations in the Buggy Function*:
The bug in the code might be related to the `else` part of the if-else condition inside the `table_exists` function. The else part is getting executed, which means the `stdout` is empty, but the function returns True which is incorrect.

*Cause of the Bug*:
When the `table_exists` method is called with a partition, the condition that checks for `if stdout` is always evaluating to True, even when the `stdout` is empty. This is causing the function to return `True` instead of `False`.

*Strategy for Fixing the Bug*:
The issue can be fixed by changing the conditional logic for the else part. Instead of just checking `if stdout`, it should also check if stdout is not empty. Additionally, the `run_hive_cmd` function may need to be checked more thoroughly, as it might not return the expected value.

*Corrected Version*:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ""  # Check if stdout is not empty
```
The corrected version checks if the `stdout` is not empty before returning `True` or `False` for the partitioned case.
