The buggy function `table_exists` is failing and preventing the tests from running successfully. 

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is failing to check whether table exists or not based on the result of the query execution. The check for the table existence is not done properly. The function is returning `False` when it should return `True`, and vice versa. 

The strategy to fix the bug is to correct the conditional checks inside the `table_exists` function so that the function returns the correct result based on the query execution.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout
```

The correction involves ensuring that the condition for checking table existence returns `True` when the table exists, and `False` when it does not. This is fixed by ensuring the correct comparison of the table name with the output.
