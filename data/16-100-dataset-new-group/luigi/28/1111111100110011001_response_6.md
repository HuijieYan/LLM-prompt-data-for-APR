The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison with the expected output. In the failing tests, the function is expected to return `True` but returns `False` instead.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `run_hive_cmd` function is returning output with a newline character, and the comparison in the `table_exists` function does not account for this.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to handle the newline character in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.strip()  # Strip the newline character for comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By adding the `strip()` method to the `stdout` variable before comparison, we remove any whitespace characters, including newline characters. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected results for the failing tests.
