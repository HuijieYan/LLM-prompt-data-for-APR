Given the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, it appears that the bug is caused by the way the function handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking for the existence of a table in a specific database.

The bug is likely due to the `table_exists` function not handling the case where the table exists correctly. The function is returning the opposite boolean value of what is expected.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic of the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the correct boolean value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout != ""  # Check if stdout is not empty
    
```

In the corrected version, we are updating the `table_exists` function to return `True` if the `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the table exists. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
