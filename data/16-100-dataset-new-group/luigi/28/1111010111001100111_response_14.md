The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in Hive. This causes the test cases to fail in situations where the case of the table name does not match the case in the Hive output. The GitHub issue #896 suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to resolve this issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner when checking against the Hive output. This can be accomplished by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.lower()  # Compare in a case-insensitive manner
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function makes use of the lower() method to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase for comparison. This modification ensures that the function performs a case-insensitive check for table existence.

By implementing this correction, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
