## Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing a case sensitivity issue when checking for existing tables in Hive. The function is not comparing the table name in a case-insensitive manner, leading to failures when the actual table name case does not match the case returned by Hive.

## Bug Cause:
The `table_exists` function uses the `run_hive_cmd` to get the list of tables and partitions from Hive. However, it does not handle the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue. The bug causes the function to incorrectly determine whether a table exists, leading to failures in some cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This will ensure that the function can accurately check for the existence of tables in Hive regardless of their case.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # previous functions... (not shown for brevity)
    
    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # No need for explicit True/False check
        
```

In the corrected version, when checking for table existence, we use the `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the tables returned from Hive. This ensures that the function will work as expected even when the case of the table names does not match.
