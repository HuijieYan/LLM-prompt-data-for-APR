The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This leads to failing tests and an open GitHub issue #896 for making `table_exists` case insensitive.

The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function because it directly compares the table name without considering case sensitivity. This leads to failing tests when trying to check for the existence of tables with differently cased names.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase and then check for its existence in the stdout, which is returned from the Hive command.

Based on the failing test, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue information, the corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function first converts the table name to lowercase using `table.lower()` and then checks if it exists in the lowercase `stdout` using `in` and `lower()`. This makes the comparison case insensitive, addressing the bug and satisfying the failing test and the open GitHub issue.
