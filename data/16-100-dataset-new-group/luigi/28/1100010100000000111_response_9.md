The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database, which causes issues when comparing table names that are different in case. The GitHub issue #896 discusses this problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by converting both the `stdout` and the table name to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# the corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we convert both `stdout` and `table` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This resolves the case sensitivity issue when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.
