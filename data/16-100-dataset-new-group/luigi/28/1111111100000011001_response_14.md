The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and retrieve the stdout. 

The first potential error location in the code is the line:
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
```
This line is trying to retrieve the list of tables in a specific database and check if a particular table exists. However, the `run_hive_cmd` function and its implementation are not provided, so it's difficult to determine if this call is correct.

The second potential error location is the line:
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                         (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
```
This line is attempting to check if a specific partition exists in a table. Again, the implementation of `run_hive_cmd` and the `partition_spec` method are needed to determine if this call is correct.

One possible cause of the bug could be incorrect parsing or handling of the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, there may be errors in constructing the Hive commands passed to `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function works as expected and that the commands being passed to it are correct. Additionally, if the `partition_spec` method is intended to provide the partition specification, it should be reviewed to ensure it is returning the correct value.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, I've made changes to the Hive commands being passed to `run_hive_cmd` to ensure they are constructed correctly. I've also modified the handling of the partition parameter to create a partition specification string that is passed to the Hive command. Finally, I've used the `bool` function to directly return a boolean value based on the presence of stdout.
