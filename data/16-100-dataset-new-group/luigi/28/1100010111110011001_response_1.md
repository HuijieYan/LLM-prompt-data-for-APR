The root cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are checking for the presence of the stdout variable but not its content. In the first condition, it checks if `stdout` exists, and in the second condition, it checks if `stdout` exists and is not empty. However, in both cases, the logic should be to check the content of `stdout`.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to check if the content of `stdout` includes the table name in the first condition, and to return based on the presence of content in the second condition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Checking if stdout has content
```

The corrected version of the function should address the issue and pass all the failing test cases.
