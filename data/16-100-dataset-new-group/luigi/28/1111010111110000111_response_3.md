The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The issue arises due to the inconsistent handling of case sensitivity when comparing table names in the function.

The failing test case `test_table_exists` inside the `contrib.hive_test` file demonstrates the bug. When the `table_exists` function is called with the table name "MyTable", it returns False instead of True, leading to an AssertionError in the test.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) for comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is not sensitive to the case of the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

After making this change, the `table_exists` function will compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the bug and making it pass the failing test case.

The GitHub issue #896 also identifies this bug and suggests exactly the same solution. Therefore, resolving this bug will address the issue reported on GitHub.
