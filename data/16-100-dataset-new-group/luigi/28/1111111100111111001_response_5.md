## Strategy for fixing the bug
Based on the failing tests and the provided code, it seems that the bug is related to the comparison of the `stdout` value with the `table` value. The function should check if the `table` value is present in the `stdout` string after running the hive command. Additionally, the function should handle case insensitivity for the table name.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to ensure that it correctly checks if the table exists in the specified database and handles case insensitivity for the table name.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
