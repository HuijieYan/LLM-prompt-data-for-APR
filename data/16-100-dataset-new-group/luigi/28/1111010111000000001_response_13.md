The buggy function `table_exists` has several issues:
1. The use of the `run_hive_cmd` function directly without being imported or defined in the class.
2. Incorrect formatting of the SQL queries.
3. The `run_hive_cmd` function should return stdout, but the code does not handle that correctly.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect use of the `run_hive_cmd` function and incorrect formatting of the SQL queries. This results in the function not returning the expected stdout and failing the test.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be properly imported/defined in the class, the SQL queries should be formatted correctly, and the function should handle the stdout as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly calls `self.run_hive_cmd` to run the Hive commands and uses correct SQL query formatting. It also handles the stdout correctly to return the expected boolean value. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
