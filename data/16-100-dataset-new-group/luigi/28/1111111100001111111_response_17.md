The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case sensitivity properly. Tables that are defined with capitalized names are returned as lower case by Hive. Therefore, the function should compare the table name with the lower case version of the output. To fix the bug, I will modify the function to convert the table name to lower case before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
