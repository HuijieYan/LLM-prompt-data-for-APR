The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity. When checking if a table exists in Hive, the function is not considering case sensitivity, leading to the failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not checking for case insensitivity. When the test cases expect a table to exist, the function does not correctly handle the case of the table name, resulting in a false negative.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when checking for the table's existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By checking for `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` in the first branch of the conditional statement, we make sure that the comparison is case insensitive, which addresses the issue raised in GitHub.

This modification ensures that the `table_exists` function correctly handles case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
