The bug in the `table_exists` method is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists. The test cases are failing because the method expects a case-insensitive comparison, but the current implementation is case sensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method should convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before checking for table existence in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the method will perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
