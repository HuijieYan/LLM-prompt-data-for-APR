The buggy function `table_exists` does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue has been reported on GitHub and is related to case-insensitive table names returning lowercase results. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for the existence of the table, effectively making the comparison case-insensitive. This addresses the bug reported on GitHub and ensures that the function behaves as expected when dealing with case sensitivity in table names.
