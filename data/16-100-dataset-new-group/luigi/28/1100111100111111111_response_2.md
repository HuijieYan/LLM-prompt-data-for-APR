To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to make it case insensitive, as discussed in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with the bug fixed:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower().splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                 ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function has been modified to make it case insensitive. The `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, allowing the function to correctly identify whether the table exists in the database.

With these changes, the corrected `table_exists` function should pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix also aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, addressing the case sensitivity issue in the original function.
