Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `table_exists` function is checking for table existence without accounting for case sensitivity.

Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity. The function checks if the table exists using the `run_hive_cmd` function, but it does not account for the case of the table name. This causes the test cases to fail when checking for table existence in different cases (capitalized, lower case, etc.).

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function now converts the table name and the result from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before checking for existence, thus making the check case insensitive. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the test cases pass.
