The buggy function `table_exists` is not working as expected, as it fails to correctly check for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue seems to stem from the `stdout` value not being correctly processed and validated against the expected output. The function is not handling the `stdout` response appropriately to determine whether the table exists or not.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly parse and validate the `stdout` response from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, it should account for case insensitivity when checking for the table name.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}".format(database, table))

            return stdout and partition_spec.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- When checking for the existence of a table, the `stdout` response is converted to lowercase and split by lines to ensure case-insensitive comparison.
- When checking for the existence of a partition within a table, the `stdout` response is converted to lowercase before performing the comparison.

By making these modifications, the function should now correctly determine the existence of the specified table or partition in the Hive database, passing the failing test cases and satisfying the expected input/output values.
