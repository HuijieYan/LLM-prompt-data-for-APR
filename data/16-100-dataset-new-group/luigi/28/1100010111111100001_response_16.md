The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be related to the incorrect comparison of the `stdout` variable to determine if a table exists. This is causing the function to return incorrect values and fail the test cases.

The bug appears to be in the conditional statements that check `if stdout` and then return `True` or `False` based on whether `stdout` has a value or not. In the first conditional statement, rather than checking if `table in stdout`, it should check if `table in stdout.split('\n')` since the `stdout` will potentially contain multiple lines due to the `show tables` command.

In the second conditional statement, it should similarly check if `self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout.split('\n')` to account for the multiple lines in the `stdout` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout.split('\n')
```
With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly identify the presence of a table or partition and pass the failing test cases.
