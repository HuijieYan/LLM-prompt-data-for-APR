The buggy function `table_exists` has two potential error locations. The first one is at the line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
The `stdout` should be converted to lowercase using `lower()` and then compare it with `table.lower()` to avoid case sensitivity issues. The second potential error is at the line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
Here, the `stdout` should also be converted to lowercase using `lower()` and then compare it with `table.lower()` to avoid case sensitivity issues.

The buggy function fails to pass the test cases because it does not handle case insensitivity while checking if a table exists. The expected input/output variable values during the failing test execution indicate that the function is expected to return the correct result even if the case of the table name or database name does not match exactly with the actual case. This issue was also reported on GitHub with the title "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive," indicating that the expected fix for the bug is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the buggy function needs to be modified to use case-insensitive comparisons while checking the existence of a table in the Hive database. This can be achieved by converting both the `stdout` and the provided table name to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
In this corrected version, both the `stdout` and the `table` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method to make a case-insensitive comparison.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue reported on GitHub about making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
