The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be in the logic that checks the return value of `run_hive_cmd`. It's not properly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The issue occurs in the `stdout` check after running the command, and it seems that the function is not properly handling the check for the table name in the `stdout`. This results in the incorrect return value in some cases. 

A potential strategy for fixing this bug would be to modify the logic for checking the `stdout` against the table name to ensure it handles both cases (when the table exists and when it doesn't) correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should address the issues identified in the failing tests and return the correct values based on the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
