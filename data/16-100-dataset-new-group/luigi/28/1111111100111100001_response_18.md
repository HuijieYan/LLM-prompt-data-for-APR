The bug in the `table_exists` function is that when the `partition` argument is not None, the function is calling `self.partition_spec(partition)`, which is a class method, in a way that does not take into account the `self` instance. 

To fix this bug, the correct way to call the `self.partition_spec` method is by using `self.partition_spec(partition)` instead of just `self.partition_spec(partition)`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
