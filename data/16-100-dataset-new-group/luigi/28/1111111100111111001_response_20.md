The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to the check for the table name in the `stdout` variable. The function is checking if the entire table name is in `stdout`, rather than individual lines, which is causing it to fail when the table name is on a new line.

To fix this bug, the function should split the `stdout` variable into lines and then check if the table name is in any of the lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')  # Split stdout into lines
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` variable into lines and then checks if the table name is in any of the lines. This change should address the bug and make the function pass the failing tests, satisfying all the expected input/output values.
