Based on the failing test cases and the provided runtime input/output values, it seems that the `table_exists` function is not handling the logic for checking the existence of the table properly. In the failing test cases, when the table does exist, the function should return `True`, and when the table does not exist, the function should return `False`.

The bug seems to be related to the logic inside the `table_exists` function when checking the stdout for table existence. It is also important to handle the case-insensitive comparison of table names. 

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made:
1. Ensure that the function returns `True` when the table exists and returns `False` when the table does not exist.
2. Handle the case-insensitive comparison of table names.
3. Ensure that the `stdout` string returned from `run_hive_cmd` is processed correctly to determine the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0}'.format(database))
        table_list = stdout.split("\n")
        return table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in table_list]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected version:
- For the case where `partition` is `None`, we get a list of tables using `show tables in {database}` and then check if the lowercase version of the input `table` exists in the list, ignoring the case. We use `split("\n")` to create a list of table names from the `stdout`.
- For the case where `partition` is not `None`, we simply check if the `stdout` is not an empty string.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
