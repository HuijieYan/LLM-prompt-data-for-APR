## Analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing issues with case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue on GitHub suggests that the function should be made case insensitive by checking the `stdout` against the lowercase version of the table name.

## Potential Error Locations
The bug is likely located in the conditional statements within the `table_exists` function where the comparison between table names is being made.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not being case insensitive, leading to issues when checking for table existence in Hive databases. The function is not handling the case sensitivity of the table names correctly, leading to test failures and potential issues with the functionality.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements in the `table_exists` function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
