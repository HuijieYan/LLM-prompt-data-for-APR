The buggy function is the `table_exists` function within the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The bug is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in a Hive database.

The problem arises from the fact that Hive databases are case insensitive, but the `table_exists` function does not take this into account when comparing table names. This causes the function to return incorrect results when checking for table existence, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name against the table names returned by Hive commands.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `map` function to convert all table names retrieved from Hive to lowercase before checking for the existence of the table. This ensures that we are comparing table names in a case-insensitive manner.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test, and the bug reported in the GitHub issues should be resolved.
