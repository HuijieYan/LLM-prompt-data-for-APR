In the provided code, the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing issues when checking for existing tables with different cases. The GitHub issue mentions that tables are sometimes defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them in lowercase. This causes the test to fail. The suggested fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive when checking for existing tables.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # No need for an if-else statement
```

In the corrected version, we use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive check for existing tables. We also simplified the `if-else` block at the end by directly returning the result of the `stdout` check using `bool(stdout)`. These changes address the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
