The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs in the else statement, where it should be checking if the table exists in the stdout, but currently it is only checking if stdout is not empty. This causes the function to return False even when the table exists.

To fix this bug, the else statement should be modified to check if the table is in the stdout, similar to how it is done in the first if statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table in stdout
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
