The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test, as well as the issue #896 raised on GitHub. The bug is due to the case sensitivity of the table name when comparing it to the output from the Hive command. The function should be case-insensitive when checking for table existence, but currently it is not.

To fix the bug:
- Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
