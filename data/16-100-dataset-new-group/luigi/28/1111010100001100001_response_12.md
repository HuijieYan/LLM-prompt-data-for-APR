The bug in the provided function is that the logic inside the if-else block is not consistent with the intended behavior. The code uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive queries. In the `table_exists` function, if there is no specified partition, it runs a query to check if the table exists, and if there is a partition, it runs a query to check if the partition exists. However, the checks for the existence of the table or partition are incorrect, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The potential error locations are within the conditions that check for the existence of the table or partition based on the `stdout` variable.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the existence of the table or partition needs to be updated to correctly interpret the result from `run_hive_cmd` and assess whether the table or partition exists based on that.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, for the case where there is no specified partition, the `stdout` result is split by newline characters and then searched for the table name. For the case where there is a partition, the function will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the partition exists, and `False` otherwise.
