The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is that it's not checking for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, causing tests to fail when comparing table names with different cases. This issue was reported in GitHub as #896 and a proposed fix was suggested.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # other functions here ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected function should resolve the issue reported in GitHub, pass the failing tests, and fix the bug.
