## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other function declarations ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
            if partition_query:
                stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_query))
                return True if stdout else False
            else:
                return False
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is due to the incorrect construction of the query string when a partition is specified. Additionally, the original function does not call the `partition_spec` function correctly, and it doesn't handle the case where `partition_spec` returns None. By fixing these issues, the corrected function will pass the failing test cases.

The strategy for fixing the bug is:
1. Call the `partition_spec` function correctly and assign the result to a variable for later use in the query string.
2. Check if the `partition_query` variable has a non-empty value. If it does, construct the appropriate query string for the partitioned case and execute the query using `run_hive_cmd`.
3. Return True if the stdout is not empty, indicating that the table exists, and False otherwise.

The corrected function logic addresses the issues found in the original code. This version now correctly checks for the existence of a table with or without a specified partition, and the expected input/output values are satisfied.
