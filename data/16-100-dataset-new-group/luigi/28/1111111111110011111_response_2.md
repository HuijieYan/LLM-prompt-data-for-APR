The buggy function fails to perform a case-insensitive check when testing whether a table exists in the Hive database, resulting in test failures. The issue was reported on GitHub and is related to the `table_exists` function not being case insensitive. The failing tests indicate that the function fails to recognize table names with different casing.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function performs a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the searched table name and the output from Hive to lowercase using the `lower` function. This modification ensures that table existence checks are not affected by differing casing.

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function will now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix addresses the reported GitHub issue and resolves the bug in the `table_exists` function.
