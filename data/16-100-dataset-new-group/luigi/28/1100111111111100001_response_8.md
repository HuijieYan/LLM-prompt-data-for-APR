The problem lies in the way the `table_exists` function is constructing the command for the `run_hive_cmd` function and how it's handling the output.

The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function is not accounting for the case where there may be multiple tables listed in the output of the "show tables" Hive command or when checking for the existence of a partition.

Instead of checking if the table name is exactly equal to the output of the Hive command, it should be checking if the table name is present in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the existence of the table and handle the case where there are multiple tables.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... [other functions]

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables'.format(database))
            tables = stdout.split("\n")
            return any(table == t for t in tables)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2}""".format(
                    database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)
                )
            )
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- When checking for the existence of a table, we split the output of `show tables` into individual table names and use the `any` function to check if the given table name exists in the list.
- When checking for the existence of a partition, we simply return whether or not the `stdout` is non-empty.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
