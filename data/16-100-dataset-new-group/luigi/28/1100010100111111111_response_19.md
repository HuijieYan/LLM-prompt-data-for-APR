The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not case insensitive. The issue on GitHub (#896) discusses this problem and suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive and should pass the failing tests. This change also aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
