The buggy function `def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):` has an issue with the conditional checks for the presence of the table and the partition. The bug is leading to incorrect output as shown in the error message from the failing test.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function returns the result of a comparison operation that checks if the table or partition exists in the stdout. However, the bug occurs when the `stdout` variable contains 'OK' and the table or partition name. The function does not treat the 'OK' as false, leading to the incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the conditional checks within the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the 'OK' message in the `stdout` variable.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return bool(stdout.strip())

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function modifies the conditional checks to return the result of `bool(stdout.strip())` to handle the 'OK' message in the `stdout` variable. This ensures that the function correctly handles the presence of the table or partition and returns the expected results for the tests.
