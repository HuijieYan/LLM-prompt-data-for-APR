Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database.

The `table_exists` function needs to be case insensitive when comparing table names with the stdout output from the Hive query. This issue was identified in the GitHub issue, where it was suggested to check the `stdout` against the lowercase version of the table name to avoid case sensitivity issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the `stdout` output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method for case-insensitive comparison. The `return` statements have also been simplified to directly return the comparison results.

This change will ensure the `table_exists` function is case insensitive, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub thread.
