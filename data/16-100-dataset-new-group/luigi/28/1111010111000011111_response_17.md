The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the tables in the database. This issue has been brought up in a GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" where it is suggested that the comparison should be case insensitive to avoid issues with table names being capitalized or not.

To fix the bug, the comparison in the `table_exists` function should be modified to be case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive, the function will now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue and is aligned with the suggested pull request.
