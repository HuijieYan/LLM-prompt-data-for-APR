The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class contains the bug. The issue is that the function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The bug has been reported on GitHub in issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower() if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, and then check for the existence of the table in the lowercased `stdout`. This change ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.
