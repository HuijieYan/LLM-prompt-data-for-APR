The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing the test cases to fail when checking for table existence with different casings. The expected behavior should be case-insensitive as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. This will ensure that the function returns the correct result regardless of the casing used.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will now compare the table names in a case-insensitive way by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and make the function pass the failing test cases.
