The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing it to not return the correct values, as evidenced by the failing test cases. The issue seems to be with the conditionals and how the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called.

In the first test case, the function returns `False` when it should return `True`. This is likely because the `run_hive_cmd` call is not properly handling the case where `stdout` is not empty.

In the second test case, the function also does not return the correct value. It returns `False` when it should return `True`. Again, this is likely due to the conditional not handling the `stdout` properly.

In the third and sixth test cases, the issue with not returning the correct value stems from the `run_hive_cmd` function and its interaction with the `partition_spec` method. The conditionals may not be properly handling the outputs of these functions.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditionals to properly check the `stdout` and handle the outputs of the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout.strip() == table  # Fixed the conditional to check the exact match
    
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")
    
            return stdout.strip() != ""  # Fixed the conditional to properly check for non-empty stdout
```

This modified version checks for the exact match in the first case and non-empty `stdout` in the second case. This should address the issues observed in the failing test cases.
