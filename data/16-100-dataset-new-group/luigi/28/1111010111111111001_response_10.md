The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the `stdout` variable contains multiple lines of output when checking for the existence of a table in the database.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the case where the `stdout` variable contains multiple lines of output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use the `split` method to split the `stdout` variable by newline characters to handle the case where `stdout` contains multiple lines of output when checking for the existence of a table.
2. We directly return the boolean value of `stdout` in the case where `partition` is not None, instead of using an if-else block.

The corrected function should now properly handle the cases where the `stdout` variable contains multiple lines of output, and it should pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
