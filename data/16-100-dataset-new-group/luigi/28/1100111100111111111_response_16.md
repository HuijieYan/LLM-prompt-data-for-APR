The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing tests due to case sensitivity in table name comparisons. The function is not comparing the table name in a case-insensitive manner, which results in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This can be done by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions in the class

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the comparison to be case-insensitive, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. This also resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding the case sensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
