The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The function does not handle case insensitivity correctly, leading to failing tests when table names are not in the expected case.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # other functions in the class...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version addresses the case sensitivity issue by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison.

After applying this fix, the failing tests should pass, and the `table_exists` function should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
