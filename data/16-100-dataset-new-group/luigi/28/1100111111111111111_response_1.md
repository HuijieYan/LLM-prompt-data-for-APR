### The buggy function and its cause
The `table_exists` function should return `True` if the table exists in the database, and `False` if it does not. The bug is that the function is case sensitive, so when it compares the table name from the database with the provided table name, it fails if the case of the names does not match. This is contrary to Hive, which is case-insensitive.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The `table_exists` function should compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner for it to behave correctly. This can be achieved by converting both the table name from the database and the provided table name to lowercase before the comparison.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like lower("{1}");'.format(database, table.lower()))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected version, both the provided table name and the table names from the database are converted to lowercase before the comparison, ensuring that the function is case-insensitive. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function pass the failing tests.
