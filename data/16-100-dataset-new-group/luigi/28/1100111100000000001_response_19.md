The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the way the `partition` argument is handled. The code is trying to build a command string using string formatting and concatenation, but it's prone to errors, and the conditional logic for checking the existence of a table with a specific partition seems flawed.

To fix this bug, we will revise the function to properly handle the `partition` argument and improve the conditional logic for checking the existence of a table with the specified partition.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition) if partition else ""
            cmd = f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str});'
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we have improved the string formatting by using f-strings for better readability and reduced the use of unnecessary conditional checks. We also cleaned up the logic for building the command string based on the presence of the `partition` argument. Additionally, we explicitly convert the `stdout` result to a boolean before returning, ensuring that the function consistently returns a boolean value for the existence of the table with the specified partition.
