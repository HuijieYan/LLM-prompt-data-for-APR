The bug in the function `table_exists` is that it does not handle case insensitivity correctly. The issue in the GitHub repository (#896) indicates that table names returned by Hive are in lowercase, causing the tests to fail when the table names are passed in a different case.

The suggested fix is to compare `table.lower()` with `stdout.lower()` to make the comparison case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using case-insensitive comparison with `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, the corrected function will now pass the failing tests and will satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix also resolves the issue posted in GitHub (#896) about making `table_exists` case insensitive.
