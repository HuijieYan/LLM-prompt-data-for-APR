The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The issue described in the GitHub post suggests that the function should be case-insensitive, as Hive is case-insensitive and often returns table names in lowercase. This results in failing tests due to case sensitivity.

The fix for this bug is to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout to be case-insenstive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the function becomes case-insensitive, aligning with the expected behavior. This change should make the function pass the failing tests and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
