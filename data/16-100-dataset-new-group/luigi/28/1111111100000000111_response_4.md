The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The GitHub issue clearly states that tables defined in capitalized letters are returned as lower case by Hive, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function to make them case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Simplify the condition by directly returning the boolean value of stdout
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for the table's existence. This ensures that case sensitivity issues are resolved. Additionally, the second conditional check is simplified by directly returning the boolean value of `stdout`.
