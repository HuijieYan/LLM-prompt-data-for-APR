The bug is in the table_exists() function of the HiveCommandClient class in the luigi.contrib.hive module. The bug is causing the test_table_exists() and test_apacheclient_table_exists() tests to fail. The bug prevents the table_exists function from properly checking if a table exists in Hive, especially with regard to case insensitivity.

The bug is caused by the comparison of the table name against the output of the Hive command without converting both to lowercase. This results in a case-sensitive comparison, which causes the tests to fail when the case of the table name does not match the case of the table name in the Hive output.

To fix the bug, the table name and the Hive output should be converted to lowercase before comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive, addressing the issue described in the GitHub issues (#895 and #896).

Here's the corrected version of the table_exists() function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the Hive output are converted to lowercase using the lower() method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub issues.

After applying this fix, the test_table_exists() and test_apacheclient_table_exists() tests should pass, addressing the bug and the corresponding GitHub issues.
