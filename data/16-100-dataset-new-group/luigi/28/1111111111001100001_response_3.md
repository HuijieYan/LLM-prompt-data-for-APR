The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a logical error. It returns `False` when `stdout` is not empty, and it should return `True`.

The bug is caused by the incorrect condition in the `else` block of the `table_exists` function, where it returns `False` when `stdout` is not empty. 

To fix the bug, the condition in the `else` block should be reversed so that it returns `True` when `stdout` is not empty, and `False` when it is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other irrelevant methods...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function returns `True` when `stdout` is not empty, and `False` when it is empty, fixing the logical error identified in the failing test cases.
