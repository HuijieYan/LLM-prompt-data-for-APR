The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be that in the `else` clause, it is not correctly using the `partition` parameter to construct the `hive` command. The `run_hive_cmd` function is called with incorrect arguments, resulting in unexpected output and causing the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly construct the `hive` command with the `partition` parameter when it is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join([f"{key}='{value}'" for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

By constructing the hive command in the `else` clause using the `partition` parameter, we ensure that the correct command is being executed when a partition is provided. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
