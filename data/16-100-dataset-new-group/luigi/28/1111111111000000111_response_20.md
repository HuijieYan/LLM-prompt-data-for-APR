### Analysis:
The issue with the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. This causes the test cases to fail because they expect case insensitivity in the result.

### Identified potential error locations:
The potential error is in the condition `table in stdout`, which is case sensitive. The `run_hive_cmd` function is supposed to return the table names, which might not match the case. The condition is not checking for case insensitivity.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing the `table_exists` function to fail case insensitive table existence checks. The provided test cases expect case insensitivity, but the function does not account for it.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should use a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence in the Hive. The function needs to compare the lowercased table name with the lowercased output from the Hive command.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected version, the function uses `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison for table existence. This change should address the case sensitivity issue and make the function pass the provided failing test cases.

The corrected function ensures that the comparison for table existence is not affected by the case of the table names. This change aligns with the GitHub issue, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and make the failing test cases pass.
