The bug in the given function `table_exists` is causing the failing test. The error messages indicate that the condition for checking whether the table exists or not is returning a wrong value. Specifically, the failing test is expecting `True` for a table that exists but is returning `False`.

The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely in the condition block checking for the existence of the table. 

The cause of the bug seems to be the logic in the `table_exists` function. The first condition block is not returning the actual values, it could be that the command executed in the `if partition is None` block is not returning the correct output to check if the table exists, resulting in false negatives.

A potential strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the command executed in both conditions provides the expected output to determine if the table exists. Consider mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function to return the expected outputs based on the input and then evaluate the condition blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('USE {0}; SHOW TABLES IN {0} LIKE "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            format_partition = ', '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            query = f"USE {database}; SHOW PARTITIONS {table} PARTITION ({format_partition});"
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
            return True if stdout else False
```

This corrected version updates the syntax to use `USE` and standard SQL query for the show of tables and partitions. It leverages the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the query and obtain the correct stdout response to determine if the table exists or not.
