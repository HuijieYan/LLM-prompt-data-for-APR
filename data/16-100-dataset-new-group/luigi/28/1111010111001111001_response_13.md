Based on the failing test cases and the expected input/output values, the buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the database. The issue seems to be with the way it handles the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function and how it evaluates the result.

The bug is caused by the incorrect evaluation of the `stdout` variable within the `table_exists` function. The function checks whether `stdout` is not empty or contains the table name, which is not the correct way to determine if the table exists.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the function to properly parse the `stdout` output and explicitly check for the existence of the table. This involves checking if the table name is present in the `stdout` for normal table existence checks, and for partitioned table existence checks, checking if the partition specification is present in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout.split('\n')
```

This corrected version explicitly checks for the presence of the table or the partition specification in the `stdout` output, which should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test cases.
