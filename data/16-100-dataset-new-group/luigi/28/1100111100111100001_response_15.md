The bug here seems to be in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class. 

The issue with the failing test cases is likely due to the condition when `partition is None` returning `False` instead of `True` when the table exists. This is evident from Case 1 and Case 4.

Additionally, it seems that the way the stdout is being checked is not handling different cases properly, as shown in Case 2 and Case 5.

To fix the bug, the condition in the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to correctly check for the existence of the table when `partition is None`, and the comparison of the table name in the stdout when `partition` is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return bool(stdout)  # check if stdout has any value
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} 
                partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False  # check if table is in the stdout
```

With this fixed version, the failing tests should pass without any issues.
