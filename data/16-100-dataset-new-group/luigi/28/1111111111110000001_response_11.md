The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition checking if `stdout` is not empty is incomplete. The buggy function does not properly handle the case where `stdout` ends with a newline character. The `run_hive_cmd` function returns output with a trailing newline character, and the buggy function does not take this into account when comparing the `stdout` against the table name.

To fix the bug, the buggy function needs to remove the newline character from the end of the `stdout` before comparing it with the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Correction: The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table == stdout.rstrip()  # Remove newline character and compare
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `rstrip` method is used to remove the newline character from the end of `stdout` before comparing it with the table name. This allows the function to correctly handle the case where `stdout` ends with a newline character.
