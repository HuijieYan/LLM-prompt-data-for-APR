The buggy function is `table_exists` and it is failing the tests due to the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable. The function is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the database. 

The bug occurs because the function is checking for the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable, but it is not handling the case where the table name is contained within other text in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the exact table name within the `stdout` variable. One way to accomplish this is by using regular expressions to match the table name in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import re

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and re.search(r'\b{}\b'.format(table), stdout)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, for the first case, it checks for the exact table name within the `stdout` using regular expressions. For the second case, it directly returns the result of the `run_hive_cmd` call, indicating the existence of the table.
