            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition

## Explanation:
The buggy function `table_exists` has a few potential error locations:
1. The use of `show tables like` instead of `show tables in`.
2. The incorrect use of `show partitions` command.
3. The conditional statements for returning True or False based on the value of `stdout`.

The cause of the bug is due to using incorrect Hive commands and incorrect conditional statement handling in the function.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves:
1. Using the correct Hive command `show tables in`.
2. Using the correct syntax for the `show partitions` command.
3. Refactoring the conditional statements to improve readability and functionality.

In the corrected version:
1. The correct Hive command `show tables in` is used to check for table existence.
2. The syntax for the `show partitions` command is corrected to include the `IN` keyword.
3. The conditional statements are refactored to directly return the boolean value based on the presence of `stdout`.

Overall, the corrected version of the function uses the correct Hive commands and ensures proper handling of conditional statements for returning the existence of tables.
