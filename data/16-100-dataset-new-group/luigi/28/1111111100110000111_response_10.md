The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The bug is causing the failing tests to return an incorrect result due to case mismatches between the actual table names and the names returned from the Hive command.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not transform the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This causes the test to fail when comparing the table names with different casing.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before performing the comparison with the Hive command output. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and accurately reflects the existence of the table in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
