The buggy function `table_exists` has issues with the logic for checking the existence of a table and its partitions within a database. The potential error locations include the logic to check for the existence of a table without a partition and the logic to check for the existence of a table with a partition.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not returning the correct value when checking for the existence of a table or its partitions. It fails to handle the return value from `run_hive_cmd` correctly, leading to incorrect evaluation of table existence.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the appropriate boolean value based on the existence of the table/partition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # if stdout is not empty, partition exists, return True
```
In the corrected version, we split the stdout by '\n' to check if the table exists in the list of tables. In the case of partitions, we simply check if stdout is not empty, and return True if the partition exists.

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
