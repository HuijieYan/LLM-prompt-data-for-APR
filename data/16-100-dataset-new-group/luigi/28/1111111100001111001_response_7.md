The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic used to check for the existence of a table in a database, especially when a partition is involved. In the case of a partition, the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called correctly to check for the existence of the table.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditional statement for checking the partition, and also by updating the command to properly check for the existence of the partitioned table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_filter = '/'.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_filter})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- The conditional statement for checking the partition has been modified to use the partition_filter constructed from the partition dictionary.
- The command to check for the existence of the partitioned table has been updated to use the `run_hive_cmd` function with the correct query.

These changes should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
