The bug is related to the `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The failing test function `test_table_exists` checks if the table exists by calling the `table_exists` function and expects specific outcomes. The failing test is due to the function not being case insensitive, causing the assertion error.

The GitHub issue titled "hive `table_exists` should be case insensitive?" describes the issue where tables that are defined as capitalized, rather than lower case underscored names, are returned in lower case, leading to test failures. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue is to use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to check for the existence of tables in a case-insensitive manner.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to make it case insensitive. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function uses `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. With this modification, the revised function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
