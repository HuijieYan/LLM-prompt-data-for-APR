The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is expected to determine if a table, and optionally a partition, exists in a given database. It uses `run_hive_cmd` to run Hive commands and parse the output to make this determination.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. The conditional statement that checks the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable.
2. The conditional statement that checks the truthiness of the `stdout` variable when checking for partitions.

The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect conditional statements checking the `stdout` variable. In the first conditional statement, the presence of the table is being checked incorrectly. In the second conditional statement, the truthiness of the `stdout` variable is not being handled correctly when checking for partitions.

A strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the conditional statement to accurately check for the presence of the table in the `stdout`.
2. Handle the truthiness of the `stdout` variable correctly when checking for partitions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table  # Correctly check for the presence of the table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Check the truthiness of the stdout variable when checking for partitions
```
