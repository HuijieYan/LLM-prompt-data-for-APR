The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing the test cases to fail when checking for table existence with different cases. The issue is well-documented in GitHub issue #896, where it is suggested to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the function to compare the lowercased `table` with the lowercased `stdout`, the function now correctly handles case-insensitive table existence checks.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issues reported in the GitHub.
