The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the `stdout` variable correctly. It checks if `stdout` has any value and if `table` is in `stdout`, but in some cases, the function is not returning the correct results. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly parsing the `stdout` response from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to handle the `stdout` response correctly and return the correct results.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).strip()
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).strip()

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `stdout` response is stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace and is split by newline characters in the case of checking for table existence. For the partition case, the `stdout` is stripped and checked for boolean value.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now return the correct results for all the given input parameters and runtime values.
