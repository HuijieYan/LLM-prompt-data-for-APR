The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not handle case insensitivity for checking table existence, leading to failed tests. The failing tests indicate that the buggy function returns incorrect results when checking for table existence due to case sensitivity.

The bug is caused by the buggy function not handling case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the stdout from the hive command.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This correction makes the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. The corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
