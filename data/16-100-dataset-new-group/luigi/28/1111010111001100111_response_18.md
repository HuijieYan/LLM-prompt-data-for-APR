The buggy function has a bug related to case sensitivity in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The issue is related to checking for existing tables in Hive, where the case of the table name can cause the test cases to fail.

The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle case sensitivity when checking for existing tables. The `table_exists` method directly compares the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names are in different cases.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method should convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison to make the comparison case insensitive. By doing this, the method will be able to correctly identify existing tables regardless of their case.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, and the method will correctly identify existing tables regardless of their case.
