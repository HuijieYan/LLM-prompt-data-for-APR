Here are the steps to fix the bug:

1. Analyze the functionality of the `table_exists` function and its impact on the failing test and GitHub issue.
2. The potential error is that the comparison of table names is case-sensitive, resulting in failing tests when the table names are in different cases.
3. The bug is caused because the `table_exists` function does not handle case-insensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from the Hive output against the table name provided in the function.
4. To fix this bug, update the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive output.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the provided table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive output are compared after converting them to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This approach ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the failing test and the related GitHub issues.
