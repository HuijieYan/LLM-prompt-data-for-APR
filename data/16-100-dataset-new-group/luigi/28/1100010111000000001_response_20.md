The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition to check if the table exists or not is not implemented correctly. 

The first potential error location is in the `if partition is None` section, where it checks if the stdout is not empty and if the table exists in the stdout. The condition should actually check if the table exists in the stdout and return true, but the current implementation returns the result of the logical and operation between `stdout` and whether the table exists in `stdout`.

The second potential error location is in the `else` section, where it checks if `stdout` is not empty and returns True, otherwise it returns False. This implementation is not correct as it should directly return the result of whether `stdout` is empty or not.

The cause of the bug is that the conditions are not correctly structured to determine if the table exists or not based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix the bug, both conditions should be modified to return a boolean value directly based on whether the table exists in the stdout or not. Additionally, the formatting of the `run_hive_cmd` should be checked to ensure it is correctly retrieving the table information from the database.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the conditions have been simplified to directly return boolean values based on whether the table exists in the `stdout` or not. This should address the bug and make the function work as expected.
