## Corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
The buggy function has a few potential error locations:
1. In the first condition, the 'show tables' command is not using the correct syntax to search for tables.
2. In the else condition, there is a syntax error in the command to show partitions.

The buggy function has a bug due to incorrect syntax in the Hive commands being used. In the first condition, the "show tables like" syntax is incorrect. In the else condition, the syntax for the "show partitions" command is also incorrect.

The bug can be fixed by using the correct syntax for the Hive commands where the 'show tables' command should use 'show tables in {database}' and the 'show partitions' command should use the correct syntax without any syntax errors.

The corrected version of the function should use the correct syntax for 'show tables' and 'show partitions' commands and also use proper string formatting to include the database, table, and partition parameters. It should also use bool() to check if stdout is not empty.
