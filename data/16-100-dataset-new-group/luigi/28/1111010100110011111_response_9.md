The bug in the given code is that the `table_exists` function is case sensitive, which causes the test cases to fail. This behavior is contrary to the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue. The issue suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to match the behavior of Hive, which is case insensitive when it comes to table names.

To resolve this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. Using the `lower()` function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the table names and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` function. This change ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive, as expected.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted on GitHub concerning the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
