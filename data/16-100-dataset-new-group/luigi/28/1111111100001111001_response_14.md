The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This function is used to run Hive commands and return the output. However, in the current implementation, the function is not correctly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and therefore not returning the expected results.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the expected results based on the input parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{} = "{}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. For the case when `partition` is not None, the `partition_spec` method used in the original implementation has been replaced with logic to construct the partition query string directly in the `table_exists` function.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function is now utilized to properly run the Hive commands and return the output as expected.

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all the provided test cases.
