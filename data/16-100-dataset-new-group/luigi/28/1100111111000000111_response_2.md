Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, the bug is related to case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The issue and the failing test suggest that stdout should be checked against the lower case of the table name to avoid case issues.

Therefore, the strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison of table name with the stdout to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner, effectively resolving the issue raised in the GitHub report and passing the failing test.
