The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect use of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the incorrect formatting of the command string when `partition` is not `None`. 

The `run_hive_cmd` function is called without the `HiveCommandClient` class instance, which means it won't be able to access the correct `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, when `partition` is not `None`, the command string is not formatted correctly.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called using the `self.run_hive_cmd` notation to ensure it is called within the `HiveCommandClient` class. Additionally, the command string needs to be formatted correctly when `partition` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                    ({2})""".format(database, table, table, partition_str))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With these changes, the `run_hive_cmd` function will be called within the context of the `HiveCommandClient` class, and the command string will be formatted correctly when `partition` is not `None`. This should fix the bug and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
