The bug in the provided function is due to the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called and processed. In both conditional branches, the function incorrectly handles the `stdout` variable and does not check it properly to determine if the table exists or not. The bug also causes the function to return `False` instead of actually checking if the table exists in the database. 

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the `run_hive_cmd` output and compare it with the table name to determine if the table exists.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2}""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return len(stdout) > 0
```

In the corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` output is properly used to check if the table exists in the database. The `stdout` variable in both branches is now checked and processed correctly to return the appropriate boolean value indicating table existence.
