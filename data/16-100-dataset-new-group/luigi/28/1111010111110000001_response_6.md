The issue with the `table_exists` function seems to be in the conditional logic for handling the `partition` parameter. In the existing implementation, the condition to return `True` if `stdout` is not empty for the case when the partition is None is correct. However, the condition to return `True` or `False` for the case when there is a partition does not seem to be implemented correctly.

The current condition:
```python
if stdout:
    return True
else:
    return False
```
will return `True` if stdout is not empty, but we need to check if the table exists in the stdout for the given partition definition.

To fix this bug, update the code within the `else` condition to parse the `stdout` and check if the table exists for a given partition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and ("{" + table + "}") in stdout
```
