The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is incorrectly checking for the presence of the table in the stdout. When `run_hive_cmd` returns no result, the function should return `False`, but it's currently returning `stdout`, which is an empty string, leading to a false-positive result.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition for when `stdout` is empty. We should also update the condition for checking the presence of the table in the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table  # Changed the condition to correctly check the presence of the table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Instead of checking for True or False, we can directly return the boolean value of stdout
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle the presence of the table in the stdout and return the expected result for the failing tests.
