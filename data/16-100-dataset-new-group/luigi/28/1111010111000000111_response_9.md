After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, test code, and the GitHub issue, here's the list of identified potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The condition `table in stdout` is case sensitive and may not account for tables with different capitalization.
2. The `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity for table names in the `stdout`.
3. The test cases are failing due to the case sensitivity of the table names.

The bug arises from the failure of the `table_exists` function to handle case insensitivity for table names in the `stdout` while running hive commands. This is confirmed by the GitHub issue, where it is suggested to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, it's suggested to modify the `table_exists` function to handle case insensitivity by lowercasing both the table name and the `stdout` data for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected function, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison to ensure case insensitivity. This change should address the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
