The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not properly handling the case when `stdout` is not empty. The function is currently returning `True` if `stdout` is not empty, regardless of whether the table exists or not. This is causing the test to fail.

To fix this, we need to modify the logic to properly check whether the table exists in the Hive database based on the content of `stdout`.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout.strip())  # Check if the stdout is not empty
```

With this correction, the function will split the `stdout` by newline character when checking for the table's existence and will return `True` only if the specified table appears in the split output. Another correction added is to use the `bool()` function to check if the `stdout` is not empty in case of partitioned tables.

This will ensure that the function returns the correct value based on the actual existence of the table in the Hive database.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
