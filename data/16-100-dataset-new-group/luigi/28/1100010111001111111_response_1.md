To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to make it case insensitive by comparing the table name with the lowercased stdout. This will resolve the issue mentioned in GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues when comparing table names in the stdout, and it should pass the failing tests. Additionally, the fix aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.
