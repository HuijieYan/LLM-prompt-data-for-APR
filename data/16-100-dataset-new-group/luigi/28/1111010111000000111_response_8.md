The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case insensitivity correctly. The issue arises from the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` with the specified table name. If the table name is in a different case in the `stdout`, the comparison fails.

The GitHub issue #896 also highlights the problem with case insensitivity and suggests fixing it by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, update the `table_exists` function to convert both the `stdout` and the table name to lower case before comparing them. This will ensure that case insensitivity is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other code)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both `stdout` and the table name are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This will address the case insensitivity issue and resolve the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
