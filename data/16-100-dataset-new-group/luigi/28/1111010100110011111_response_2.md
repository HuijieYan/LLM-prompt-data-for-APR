The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive and does not handle different case scenarios for the table name. This has been identified as a bug in the GitHub issue #896, where it is suggested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to match the table names.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly. When checking if a table exists, it directly compares the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`, which may not match if the cases are different.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase or uppercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.lower()  # Convert stdout to lowercase for comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive and the failing tests should pass. This change also addresses the GitHub issue #896.
