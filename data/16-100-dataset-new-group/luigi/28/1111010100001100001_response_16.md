The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the conditional checks and the logic for determining the existence of a table or partition in a Hive database. It seems that the function is not handling the stdout output correctly and is returning incorrect results.

Based on the runtime values and types of variables provided, it is clear that the function is not properly checking for the existence of a table or partition in the Hive database. The function is not handling the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly and is not performing the necessary checks to determine the existence of the specified table or partition.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` calls and perform the appropriate checks to determine the existence of the specified table or partition.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the stdout is split based on spaces, and the existence of the table is checked based on the presence of the table name in the split output. For the partition case, the function simply checks if stdout is not empty to determine the existence of the specified partition.
