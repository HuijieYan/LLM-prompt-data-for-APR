The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way it's checking the existence of a table and handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It's also using the `self.partition_spec` method incorrectly.

The buggy function is not handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly, leading to incorrect evaluation of the `stdout` variable. Additionally, it's incorrectly using the `self.partition_spec` method to generate a partition specification.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `stdout` variable is processed correctly, and that the `self.partition_spec` method is used in the correct way.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_clause = " and ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_clause))
            return table in stdout
```

In this corrected version, we are properly processing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function based on whether a partition is specified or not. We construct the partition clause using the `partition` parameter and use it in the `show partitions` command to check for the existence of the table.

This should resolve the issues present in the failing tests and ensure that the `table_exists` function works as expected.
