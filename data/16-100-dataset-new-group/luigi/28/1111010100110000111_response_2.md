## The cause of the bug
The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the fact that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive. The function only checks for an exact match of the table name in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to test failures when the table name is in a different case from what is returned by Hive.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by making the comparison case-insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing, the `table_exists` function now handles case sensitivity properly and should pass the failing tests.
