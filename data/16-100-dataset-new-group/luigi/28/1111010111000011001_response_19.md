The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is not returning the expected values for the given test cases. The issue seems to be with the conditional logic inside the function.

The cause of the bug is that the conditionals are not checking the stdout value correctly.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to properly check for the expected outputs in the stdout variable and return True or False accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
