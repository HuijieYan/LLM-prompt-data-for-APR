The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the return value based on the `stdout` variable. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to get the output of a Hive command, and then checks if certain conditions are met based on that output. 

The buggy function is using the `stdout` variable, which is derived from calling the `run_hive_cmd` function, to check if the table exists. The problem seems to be that the function is not handling the different types of stdout correctly, leading to incorrect evaluations.

Based on the failing tests, the expected values of the `stdout` variable are known:
- Case 1 expects `stdout` to be 'OK'
- Case 2 expects `stdout` to be 'OK\nmytable'

The buggy function is not correctly evaluating the `stdout` variable in these cases, which is leading to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to appropriately handle the stdout based on the different types of return values from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should correctly parse the stdout to determine if the table exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `stdout` variable is handled appropriately based on the different conditions, and the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
