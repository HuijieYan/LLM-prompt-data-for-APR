The buggy function `table_exists` fails because it does not correctly handle case sensitivity of table names. The function needs to compare the table name with the table names returned from the query in a case-insensitive manner.

The bug arises from the fact that the function compares the table name directly with the standard output in a case-sensitive manner, leading to failed tests and assertions.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the standard output to either lower case or upper case for a case-insensitive comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this correction, both the table name and the standard output are converted to lower case for a case-insensitive comparison. This ensures that the function will correctly identify the existence of the table regardless of the case of letters in the table name.

With this correction, the failing tests are expected to pass, and the issue raised in GitHub will be resolved as well.
