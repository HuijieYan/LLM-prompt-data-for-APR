The bug in the `table_exists` method is related to how the result from running the Hive command is being handled. When checking if a table exists, the method should return `True` if the table is found, and `False` otherwise. However, it is currently returning `True` if any output is received from the Hive command and `False` otherwise.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic to explicitly check if the table is present in the output from the Hive command. Additionally, we should make sure to account for case insensitivity when comparing the table names.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` method is as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()  
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, we use `stdout.lower().split()` to parse the output and check if the lowercase version of the table name is present in the split output, ensuring case insensitivity.
