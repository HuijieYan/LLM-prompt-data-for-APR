The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the case when `stdout` contains the table name. The function checks for the presence of `table` in `stdout`, but the test cases indicate that `stdout` returns a string with the table name included.

The bug occurs due to the conditional statement `return stdout and table in stdout`. This check will return `True` even if `table` is not explicitly found in `stdout`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to check for an exact match of the table name in `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other class functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return table in stdout.split("\n")
```

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` by newline and check if the table name is an exact match in the returned list.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
