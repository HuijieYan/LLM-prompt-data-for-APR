The buggy function fails because it does not handle the `table_exists` method correctly, which causes it to return the wrong output. 

Here is a breakdown of the detected errors:

1. In the first and fourth cases, when `partition` is not None, the `table_exists` method calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command but doesn't handle the command output correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

2. In the second and fifth cases, there is an issue with the case sensitivity of table names. The `table_exists` function is not handling the case-insensitive comparison properly, leading to the wrong return value.

3. In the third and sixth cases, when `partition` is provided, the `partition_spec` method is called incorrectly, causing the `run_hive_cmd` function to receive incorrect arguments, leading to the wrong return value.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method needs to handle the `run_hive_cmd` output correctly, perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table names, and correctly call the `partition_spec` method when a partition is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split('\n')
        else:
            partition_filter = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            query = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_filter)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- When `partition` is not None, the `table_exists` method builds a query and runs the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute it, correctly handling the command output and return values.
- The table name comparison is now case-insensitive using the `lower()` method before comparison.
- The `partition_spec` method is not called in this corrected version as it is not used in the `table_exists` method.

The corrected function should now pass the previously failing test cases.
