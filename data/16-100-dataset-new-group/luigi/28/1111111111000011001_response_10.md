The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not properly handle the `run_hive_cmd` function's return values. Depending on the return value of `run_hive_cmd`, the function should return either True or False, but it does not do this consistently.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly check the return value of `run_hive_cmd`. In the failing test, the return values of `run_hive_cmd` are mocked to certain values, but the function does not handle these values correctly.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to properly check the return value of `run_hive_cmd` and return True or False accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the return value of `run_hive_cmd` is properly checked and converted to a boolean using the `bool` function. This ensures that the function returns True or False as expected based on the return value of `run_hive_cmd`.
