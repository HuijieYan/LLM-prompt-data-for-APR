The buggy function is the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class. This function is intended to check if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and then checks the output to determine if the table exists.

There are a few issues with the current implementation:
1. When checking for table existence without a partition, the code checks if the table name is in the stdout. However, this method is not reliable as the actual output might contain multiple lines or have extra whitespace.
2. When checking for table existence with a partition, the code constructs the Hive command incorrectly and might not handle the output properly.

To fix the issues, we need to:
- Improve the logic to parse the output and check for table existence without a partition.
- Correctly construct and handle the output when checking for table existence with a partition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()

        else:
            partition_str = ",".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- When checking for table existence without a partition, we use `show tables in {database};` to get the list of tables and then check if the table name is in the resulting list after splitting the stdout.
- When checking for table existence with a partition, we construct the `SHOW PARTITIONS` command correctly using the partition spec and directly return whether the stdout is non-empty.
