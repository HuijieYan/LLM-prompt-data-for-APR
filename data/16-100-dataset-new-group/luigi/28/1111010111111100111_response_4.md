To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by comparing the table name with the output in a case-insensitive manner.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them. This makes the comparison case-insensitive as required.

The fix addresses the GitHub issue by making `table_exists` case-insensitive, and it should resolve both failing test cases as well.
