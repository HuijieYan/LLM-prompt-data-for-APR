The key issue with the `table_exists` function is in the way it parses the `stdout` value and determines whether a table or partition exists. It does not correctly handle the cases where multiple tables or partitions are returned in the `stdout` value. Another error is in the logic for processing the partition condition.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for checking whether the table or partition exists. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the multiple table/partition case and also correctly processes the partition condition.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return bool(partition in partitions)
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` by newline and check for the presence of the table or partition in the list of tables or partitions. This ensures that we handle scenarios where multiple tables or partitions are returned in the `stdout`. We also correctly process the partition condition, ensuring that it is present in the list of partitions.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
