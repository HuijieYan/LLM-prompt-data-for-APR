The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that it always returns `False` when the `partition` parameter is `None`, regardless of the output of `run_hive_cmd`. In addition, when the `partition` parameter is not `None`, it always returns `True` regardless of the result of `run_hive_cmd`.

The cause of the bug is that for the first part of the `if` statement (when `partition` is `None), the function only checks if `stdout` is not empty and if the `table` is in `stdout`. It doesn't handle the case where `stdout` is empty, which would require returning `False`.

For the second part of the `if` statement, when `partition` is not `None`, the function only checks if `stdout` is not empty but doesn't handle the case where `stdout` is empty, which would require returning `False`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case where `stdout` is empty for both parts of the `if` statement. Additionally, it should return `False` instead of `True` when `stdout` is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function properly handles the cases where `stdout` is empty, and also uses the `bool` function which returns `True` when `stdout` is not empty and `False` when `stdout` is empty. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
