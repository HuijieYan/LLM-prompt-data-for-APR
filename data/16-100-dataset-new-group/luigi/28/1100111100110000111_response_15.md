The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test due to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. The issue on GitHub confirms that the function should be case insensitive, and the proposed fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.
2. Use the `lower()` method to convert the table name and `stdout` to lowercase and perform the comparison.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
