The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect. The `stdout` variable contains the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which is the result of the Hive query. So, the condition should only check if the table name is present in the `stdout` string, which can be done using the `in` keyword.

Additionally, the logic for handling the `partition` parameter seems to be incorrect. It should use the `partition_spec` function to generate the partition specification and then use it in the Hive query.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_spec))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
