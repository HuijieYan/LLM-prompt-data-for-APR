The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class within the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file fails the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` tests. The problem has to do with the way the `stdout` variable is being checked and returned.

When `run_hive_cmd` is called with specific inputs, it returns a string. The `table_exists` function uses this string to determine whether the table exists or not. However, the function incorrectly checks if the string is not empty and then checks if the table name is in the string. This logic is flawed because the output string could potentially contain other text unrelated to the table name, which would lead to false positives.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to properly parse the output from `run_hive_cmd` and check for the presence of the table name in a structured way.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        # Check if table exists in the list of tables
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        # Check if the partition exists
        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version checks if the table name is present in the list of tables returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function when no partition is specified. For cases where a partition is specified, the function simply checks whether the `stdout` is not empty to determine if the table exists.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
