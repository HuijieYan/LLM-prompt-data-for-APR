The bug in the function `table_exists` is causing the test cases to fail. The issue seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the database. The bug is mentioned in the GitHub issue #896, where it is suggested to make `table_exists` case insensitive.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling case-sensitive comparisons when checking for the existence of a table in the database. The function needs to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them to make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
       
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
      
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now perform a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in the database.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue reported in GitHub.
