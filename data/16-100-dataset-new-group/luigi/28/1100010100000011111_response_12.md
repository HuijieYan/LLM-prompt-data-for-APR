The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle the case-insensitivity of table names, causing issues when checking for the existence of a table. The bug was reported in a GitHub issue where it was suggested to make `table_exists` case insensitive by checking the `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensures that the function returns the expected values and types for the provided test cases.
