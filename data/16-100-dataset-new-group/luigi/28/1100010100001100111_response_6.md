The bug in the function `table_exists` is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The bug leads to test failures when the case of the table name and the case of the table name returned by Hive do not match.

The proposed strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the table names returned by Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This change makes the comparison case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issues.
