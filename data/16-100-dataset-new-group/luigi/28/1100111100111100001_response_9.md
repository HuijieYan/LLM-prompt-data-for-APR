Based on the given error message and the provided failing tests, it seems that the buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case-insensitive comparison of table names correctly, resulting in failing assertions when the table name is passed with different cases.

Potential Error Location:
In the `table_exists` function, the comparison of the table name from the `stdout` does not consider the case of the table name, leading to incorrect comparisons and failing tests.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner, which results in failing assertions when the case of the table name differs.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison of the table name in the `table_exists` function should be made case-insensitive.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
