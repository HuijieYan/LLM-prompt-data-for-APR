The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has an issue when checking for the existence of a table in the database, especially with partitions.

The issue with the current implementation is that it doesn't handle the case where `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty string. If `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty string, the function will always return False, making it fail the test cases where an empty string is a valid return value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to handle the case where `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty string by considering it as a valid response when checking for table existence.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Simply return the boolean value of stdout
```

With this correction, the `stdout` value will be correctly evaluated and handled to reflect the table's existence, whether it's an empty string or not.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test as it addresses the issue with empty string return from `run_hive_cmd`.
