The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the logic used to check the existence of a table in the Hive client. The function incorrectly checks for the presence of a table by checking if the table name is part of the output from the Hive command, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should explicitly check for the existence of the table, rather than checking if the table name is present in the output. This can be achieved by modifying the command used to query the existence of the table in the Hive client.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}"')

            return len(stdout.split('\n')) > 1  # Check the length of the output to determine existence
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})')

            return len(stdout.split('\n')) > 1  # Check the length of the output to determine existence
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should correctly determine the existence of a table in the Hive client. This updated function should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output for the given input values.
