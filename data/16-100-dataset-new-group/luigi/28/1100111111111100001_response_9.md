The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is always checking if the `stdout` variable is truthy, but in the second case, even if the stdout is not empty, it is not confirming if the table exists. It is only checking if there is some output, this causes the assertion error.

To fix this, we need to update the condition for returning `True` when checking for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and "OK" in stdout
```

After making this change, the failing test should pass without any assertion errors.
