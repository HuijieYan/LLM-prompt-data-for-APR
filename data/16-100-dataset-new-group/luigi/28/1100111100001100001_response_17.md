The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class lies in the conditional statement checking the existence of a table with partitions. The bug is causing incorrect results due to improper string formatting in the conditional statement when `partition` is not None.

The strategy to fix the bug is to use proper string formatting and include the `partition` condition in the query when calling `run_hive_cmd`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_conditions = " and ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_conditions))
        return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty
```

In this corrected version, when `partition` is not None, we construct the `partition_conditions` string by joining the key-value pairs in the `partition` dictionary, and then include this in the query when calling `run_hive_cmd`. We also use the `bool` type to ensure that the function returns a boolean value in all cases.
