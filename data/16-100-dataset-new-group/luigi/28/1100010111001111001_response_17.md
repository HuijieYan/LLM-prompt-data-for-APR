The issue with the provided buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case where the output includes multiple lines, as seen in the failing tests.

The buggy function fails for the following reasons:
1. For the first two cases, it fails because the function does not handle the output when there are multiple lines returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function only checks if the table name is in the output without considering the newline characters.
2. For the third and fourth cases, it fails because the function does not properly handle the partition parameter.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the cases where there are multiple lines in the output and consider the partition parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        if stdout and table in stdout.split('\n'):
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function will properly handle cases where there are multiple lines in the output and consider the partition parameter while checking the table existence.
