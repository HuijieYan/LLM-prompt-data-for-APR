The issue with the buggy function seems to be that the condition for checking the existence of a table or partition is not being evaluated correctly. The function seems to be returning based on the truthiness of the `stdout` variable, which may not accurately reflect the presence of the desired table or partition.

To fix the bug, we should explicitly check the presence of the table or partition in the `stdout` variable instead of relying on truthiness.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout
```

With this correction, the function will now properly check for the existence of the specified table or partition in the `stdout` variable and return True or False accordingly.
