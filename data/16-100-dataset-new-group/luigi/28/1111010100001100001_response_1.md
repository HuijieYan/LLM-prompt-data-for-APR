The bug in the function `table_exists` occurs due to the inconsistent handling of the `stdout` variable in the different branches of the if-else condition.

The buggy function does not properly account for the case when the table exists in the database and instead relies on the presence of any output in `stdout` to determine existence. This logic is flawed and leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly validate the existence of the table in both cases (partitioned and non-partitioned) based on the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(partition in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks whether the table is in the list of tables returned by the `show tables` command for the non-partitioned case, and whether the specific partition is in the list of partitions returned by the `show partitions` command for the partitioned case. This ensures that the function accurately determines the existence of the table in both cases.
