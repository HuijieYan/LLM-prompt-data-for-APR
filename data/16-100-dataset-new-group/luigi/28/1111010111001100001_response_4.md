The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the conditional checks and the value of `stdout`.

The bug is causing the function to always return `True`, because it only checks the truthiness of `stdout` and not whether it actually contains the table or partition information.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly check the `stdout` for the presence of the table or partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                           ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- For the case of no partition, the `stdout` is split by newline character and checked if the table exists in the list of tables returned by `show tables` command.
- For the case of a partition, the `stdout` is simply evaluated as a boolean.

This corrected function should pass the failing test cases.
