The bug here is in the table_exists function of the HiveCommandClient class in luigi.contrib.hive. The function is not correctly handling the case when partition is None. It is not returning the correct value when the table exists. Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of a table in both the cases (with or without partition) is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to correctly handle both cases and return the appropriate boolean value. In the case when partition is None, the function should check the stdout for the table name. If it exists, return True, otherwise False. In the case when partition is not None, the function should check if stdout is not empty and return True, otherwise False.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the corrected test function should pass all the assertions.
