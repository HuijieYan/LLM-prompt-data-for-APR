The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the table exists check to be case sensitive, leading to failures when tables are defined with capitalized names. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem and proposes a fix to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the `stdout` against the lowercase version of the table name.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by comparing the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `stdout`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the `stdout` and the table name are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This change makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
