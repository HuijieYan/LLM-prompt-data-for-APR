The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way it handles the `table` input and the `stdout` variable. 

The function `run_hive_cmd` is called with a command to execute in Hive, and its output is stored in the `stdout` variable. In the first part of the function, it checks if the `partition` parameter is `None`. If it is, the function runs a Hive command to check if the table exists in the given database. Otherwise, it constructs a more complex Hive command using the `partition_spec` function.

Based on the failing test cases and the runtime input/output values provided:
1. In Case 1 and Case 4, the function seemingly has trouble identifying the `table` variable in the `stdout` from the Hive command output. This suggests that the comparison `table in stdout` might not be working as intended.
2. In Case 2 and Case 5, the function is not correctly identifying the `table` variable in the `stdout` from the Hive command output, which causes it to fail.
3. In Case 3 and Case 6, the `partition_spec` function's output might not be correctly formatted, leading to an incorrect Hive command being executed.

To fix the bug, the comparison `table in stdout` should be revised to accurately check if the table exists in the Hive command output. Additionally, the construction of the Hive command in the `else` block should be reviewed to ensure that the correct partition specification is being used in the command.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))  # Updated Hive command
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{} = "{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])  # Construct the partition specification string
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))  # Updated Hive command
    
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

In this corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. Modified the Hive commands to explicitly specify the database when checking for table existence and constructing the partition specification.
2. Updated the condition to check if stdout is not empty, simplifying the return statement.
