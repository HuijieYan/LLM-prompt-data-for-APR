The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity in table names when checking for their existence. This is highlighted in the GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".

The `table_exists` function currently compares the table name directly with the output of the Hive command without applying any case normalization. This results in false negatives when the table name's case does not match the case of the table name in Hive.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command needs to be case insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
``` 

In this corrected version of the function, the table name and the output of the Hive command are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
