The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by improper formatting of the hive command query when the partition is not None. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called properly, and the `stdout` variable is not being checked correctly when the partition is not None.

To fix this bug, we need to properly format the hive command query and call the `run_hive_cmd` function with the correct command. Then, we need to properly check the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all the provided cases.
