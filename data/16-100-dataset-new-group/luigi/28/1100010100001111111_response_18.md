The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive.

The function has two cases: one where the `partition` parameter is `None`, and another where `partition` is not `None`. In both cases, the function runs a Hive command and checks the output to determine if the table exists.

The bug is due to the function not handling case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name in the Hive command output with the input table name.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, the input table names are converted to lowercase before running the Hive command, and the comparison of table names is also done in a case-insensitive manner. This change resolves the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
