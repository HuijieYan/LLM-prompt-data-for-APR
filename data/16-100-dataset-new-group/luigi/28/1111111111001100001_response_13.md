The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the conditional checks using the `stdout` variable after calling the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the first conditional block, the function checks for a table in the `stdout`, but the condition is incorrect as it's currently checking for a truthy value, which means it will return True even if the table is not found. In the second conditional block, the function checks if `stdout` has a value, but it should be checking if the table is present in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the return values of the `run_hive_cmd` function and appropriately check for the presence of the table in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other class methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the first conditional block checks if the table name is in the `stdout` after splitting it by newlines. The second conditional block simply returns `bool(stdout)` to check if the `stdout` has a value, which will be False if it's empty.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
