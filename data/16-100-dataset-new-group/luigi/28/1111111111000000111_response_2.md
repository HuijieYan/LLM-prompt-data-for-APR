The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case sensitive, but the GitHub issue suggests that it should be case insensitive. The correct implementation should check the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name with the results from `stdout` in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase for the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Import required mock module
import mock

# The declaration of the corrected class containing the fixed function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
```

The modified function checks for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the `stdout` result to lowercase for comparison. This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and the failing test.
