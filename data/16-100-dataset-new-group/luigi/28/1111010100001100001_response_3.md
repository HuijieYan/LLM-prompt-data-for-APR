The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the database. The function attempts to use the `hive` command to find tables and partitions, but the logic for checking the results is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function returns `stdout and table in stdout`, which will only return `True` if both conditions are met, but it should only check if the table is present in `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to directly check if the table exists in the `stdout` result, without using the `and` operator.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
