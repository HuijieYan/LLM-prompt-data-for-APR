To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when comparing the table name in the stdout. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly compare the table name in a case insensitive manner, resolving the bug and making it pass the failing test cases. This also addresses the issue raised in GitHub about making `table_exists` case insensitive.
