The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the way it handles the `stdout` variable and its relationship with the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The buggy function, `table_exists`, is failing the provided tests. The failing test cases provide the following problem:
1. In cases when the `stdout` is not empty (e.g., from the `run_hive_cmd` call), the `table_exists` function does not correctly handle the existence of the table. This is causing the first, second, fourth, and fifth test cases to fail.
2. In case of partitioning, the function incorrectly handles the `stdout` value and does not correctly determine the existence of the table, causing the third and sixth test cases to fail.

To fix this bug:
1. In the main part of the `table_exists` function, modify the `stdout` check to return `True` if the table name is found in `stdout`, and `False` otherwise, regardless of the content of `stdout`.
2. Additionally, in the case of partitioning, modify the `stdout` check to return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, and `False` otherwise.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This version of the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
