Potential error locations:
1. The comparison of the table name in the `table_exists` function is case sensitive.
2. The function does not account for the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive database.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive database. When checking for an existing table, the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, which is case insensitive. This causes the test to fail when the table names are defined with different cases.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to make the comparison of table names case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for comparison.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
