The bug in the code lies in the `table_exists` function where it fails to account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive. This is in line with the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command. This will ensure case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By checking the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from the Hive command, we ensure case insensitivity when determining table existence.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the GitHub issue posted regarding making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
