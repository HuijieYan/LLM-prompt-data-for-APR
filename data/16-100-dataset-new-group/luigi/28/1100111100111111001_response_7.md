To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is correctly called with the appropriate parameters. Additionally, we need to verify that the `stdout` variable is being checked for the presence of the table name.

In the first part of the buggy function, the call to `run_hive_cmd` with the SQL command to show tables should work correctly, as it is expected to return a string including the table name if it exists. The issue seems to be with the condition on the return value, which should be `stdout.strip() and table in stdout.strip()` to ensure that the `stdout` variable is properly checked for the existence of the table.

In the second part of the function, when a partition is specified, the `run_hive_cmd` call with the SQL command to show partitions should also be correct. However, the condition checking the `stdout` variable is not appropriate and should be modified to `return bool(stdout.strip())` to ensure that `stdout` is evaluated as a boolean.

Additionally, we should ensure that the `self.partition_spec` function is called correctly to generate the partition specification.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout.strip() and table in stdout.strip()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In the corrected version, we are ensuring that the `stdout` variable is properly checked for table existence, and the `self.partition_spec` function is used to generate the partition specification. 
This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
