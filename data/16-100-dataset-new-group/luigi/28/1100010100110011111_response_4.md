To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables in the stdout is case-insensitive. We can do this by converting both the table name and the tables in the stdout to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will perform a case-insensitive check when determining if a table exists. This fix should resolve the failing test cases and also address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the case sensitivity of table_exist function.
