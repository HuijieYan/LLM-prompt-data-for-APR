The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function is not handling cases where the table name is in a different case than expected, leading to incorrect return values. The issue has been reported on GitHub as "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" with a proposed fix to check the `stdout` against the lowercase version of the table name.

To fix the bug, we will modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercased `table` with the lowercased `stdout` to make the comparison case insensitive.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
