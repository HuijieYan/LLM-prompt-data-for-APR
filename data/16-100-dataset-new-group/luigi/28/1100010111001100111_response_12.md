The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. This results in failing test cases when the table name's case does not match the case of the returned table names in the `stdout`. The GitHub issue #896 confirms that this behavior is unintended, and the suggested fix is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).lower()

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).lower()

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout
```

With the changes mentioned above, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass all the failing test cases. This fixes the bug and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
