## Bug Analysis
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing because the condition to check if a table exists is not correctly implemented. When the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the string "OK", the `table_exists` function should return `True`, but this is not happening. Additionally, when the table name is not found in the `stdout` string, the function should return `False`, but it is also not happening.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the logic used to check the presence of the table in the `stdout` string. When the `run_hive_cmd` function returns a string, the `table_exists` function should check if the table name is present in that string. If it is there, the function should return `True`, otherwise it should return `False`. The logic used to perform this check is incorrect, which is causing the function to return the wrong values.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adapt the logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly check if the table name is present in the `stdout` string and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By changing the logic to check if `stdout` contains the table name and returning `True` or `False` based on that, we ensure that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected.
