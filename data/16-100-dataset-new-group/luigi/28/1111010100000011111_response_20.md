### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking if the table exists in the Hive database. The bug causes issues when there are tables with capitalized names which are being compared to lowercase table names returned by Hive. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to perform a case-insensitive match.

### Corrected Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` for case-insensitive comparison. We also simplify the logic in the `else` block to directly return the boolean value of `stdout`. This corrected version addresses the bug and should satisfy all the expected input/output values.
