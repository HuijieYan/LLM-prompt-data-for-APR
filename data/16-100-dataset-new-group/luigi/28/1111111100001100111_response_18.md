Potential Errors:
1. The function does not handle case sensitivity, leading to inconsistent results when checking for table existence.

Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `table_exists` does not consider case sensitivity. As pointed out in the GitHub issue, sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lowercase. This leads to test failures when checking for an existing table with a capitalized name.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Modify the function to make it case insensitive when checking for table existence. This can be achieved by comparing the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive.

Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
