The bug in the provided function is due to the condition checking the existence of the table in the database or its partitions. The function is incorrectly checking the presence of the table or partition and returning the opposite of the expected result in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements in the function to accurately check for the existence of the table or partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we removed the unnecessary 'and' condition in the first return statement, and we updated the second return statement to directly return the boolean value of `stdout`.

This should fix the bug and accurately determine the existence of the table or partition in the specified database.
