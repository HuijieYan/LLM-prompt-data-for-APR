To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name to the output from Hive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change, the function will now compare the lowercase version of both the `table` and the `stdout`, making it case insensitive and allowing the function to pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issues.
