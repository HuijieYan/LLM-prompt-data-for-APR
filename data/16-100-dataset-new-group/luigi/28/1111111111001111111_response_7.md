The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity of the table name when checking if it exists in the Hive database. The expected behavior is to make the comparison case-insensitive, but the current implementation does not handle this case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison so that it is case-insensitive. Instead of just checking if the table name is in the `stdout` as it is, we should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase and then perform the comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

After making this change, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. This also addresses the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
