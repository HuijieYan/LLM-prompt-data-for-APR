The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs due to case sensitivity, causing the function to fail when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. This was noted in GitHub issue #896 and a proposed fix suggested to make `table_exists` case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the table names obtained from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
In the corrected version of the function, the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the table names from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison. This change ensures case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
