The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not check for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the tables found in `stdout`. This leads to failures when the table names are not in the same case as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with `stdout`, making the comparison case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version converts both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive match. This solution satisfies all the failing test cases and resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding case sensitivity in table existence checks.
