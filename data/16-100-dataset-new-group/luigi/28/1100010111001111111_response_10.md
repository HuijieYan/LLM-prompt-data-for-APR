The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle the case insensitivity of table names in Hive. The `table_exists` function fails to properly compare the table name due to differences in case when checking for table existence. This discrepancy causes the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function works as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version converts both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive. This fixes the bug and makes the function behave as expected.
