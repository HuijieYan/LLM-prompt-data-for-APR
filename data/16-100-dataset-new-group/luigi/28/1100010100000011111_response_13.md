### Issue Analysis
The issue posted on GitHub highlights the problem where the table_exists function is case-sensitive, causing failures when looking for tables that are defined with capitalized names. The proposed solution is to make the function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

### Error location
The error occurs when comparing the `table` input parameter to the `stdout` variable. The comparison is case-sensitive, which causes the function to fail when the table names are capitalized.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the comparison of the `table` parameter with the `stdout` variable is case-sensitive. This results in a failure when looking for tables that are defined with capitalized names, as they are returned as lowercase by Hive.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the comparison between the `table` parameter and the `stdout` should be made case-insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the function makes the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`. This ensures that the function will correctly identify the table's existence, regardless of the case of the table name.
