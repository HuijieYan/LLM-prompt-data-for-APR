The bug in the provided function is that it does not correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function for both the cases where `partition` is None and when it is not None. It also does not accurately check for the existence of the table.

To fix this bug, the function should properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and check if the table exists based on the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

This corrected version properly handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks if the table exists based on the stdout. It also returns a boolean value indicating whether the table exists or not.
