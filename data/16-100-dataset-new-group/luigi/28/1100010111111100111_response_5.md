Given the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the bug is caused by the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command, where the case sensitivity is not handled properly.

The faulty logic in the buggy function is causing the failing test cases to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issues reported on GitHub.
