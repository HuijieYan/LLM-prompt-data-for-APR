The buggy function has an issue in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The issue arises due to the case sensitivity of the table names when checking for their existence in the Hive database.

The buggy function `table_exists` has two main issues:
1. When checking for the existence of a table, it does not handle case insensitivity for table names.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function may not be returning the expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` method to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. Also, we need to handle the potential variability in the returned values from `run_hive_cmd`.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_clause = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_clause})')
            return bool(stdout)  # No need for explicit condition check
```

This corrected version uses the `lower()` method to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner. It also simplifies the condition checks in the code.

With these changes, the function should now pass the test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values as well as resolve the GitHub issue.
