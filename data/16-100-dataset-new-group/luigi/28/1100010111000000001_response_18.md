The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that the logic for checking the existence of a table in the database and the existence of a partition in the table is flawed. The function is not handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly, which leads to incorrect results in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and returns the correct result based on the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)});"
        )
        return stdout.strip() != ""
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show tables like '{table}';")
        return table in stdout.split()
```

In the corrected version, we properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the correct result based on whether the table or partition exists in the database.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test.
