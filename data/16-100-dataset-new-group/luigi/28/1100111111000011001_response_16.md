The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with its logic when checking for the existence of a table in a database, particularly when a partition is specified. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and then checks the output to determine if the table exists. However, the function fails to handle the partition condition properly, leading to incorrect results.

The issue can be identified in the conditional block where the function checks for the existence of a partition. The formatting of the Hive command is incorrect and does not account for the specified partition.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly format the Hive command to include the specified partition, if provided, and then process the output to determine the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_clause = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_clause))

            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

The correction includes fixing the formatting of the Hive command to include the specified partition and then checking the stripped output to determine the existence of the table.

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
