The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not case insensitive when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The failing tests in the GitHub issue highlight this problem, as they are expecting the function to handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison. This will ensure that it is case insensitive when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Using this corrected version of the function, it will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `stdout`, making the comparison case insensitive. This should resolve the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub.
