The cause of the bug is that the return value of `run_hive_cmd` is not correctly handled when checking for table existence and partition existence. The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the return value of `run_hive_cmd` properly, leading to the failing tests and causing an AssertionError.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional logic for checking the return value of `run_hive_cmd` when looking for the existence of the tables or partitions.

To fix the bug, the return value of `run_hive_cmd` needs to be handled properly. Upon receiving the output from `run_hive_cmd`, the function needs to check if the table or partition exists based on the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `run_hive_cmd` outputs are checked for the existence of the table or partition and then returned accordingly. This updated logic ensures that the function returns the correct boolean value based on the presence of the table or partition in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
