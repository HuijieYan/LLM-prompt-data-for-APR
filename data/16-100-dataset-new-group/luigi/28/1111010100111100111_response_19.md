The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing because it does not correctly handle case sensitivity, as specified in the GitHub issues #896 and #897. The function currently checks if the table name is directly present in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, Hive is case-insensitive, so the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the table names present in the output.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function must be modified to handle case sensitivity properly. It can be fixed by converting both the table name and the output table names to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout is not None
```

The updated version uses the `map` function to convert all table names in the command stdout to lowercase, and then checks if the lowercase table name exists in the list.

This fix will resolve the case insensitivity issue when checking for table existence in the Hive database and ensure the function passes the failing tests.
