The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. This function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and determines if a table exists in a given database. Additionally, it uses the `partition_spec` function from the same file to handle partition information.

The potential error locations within the buggy function `table_exists` are:
1. The check for the existence of a table is incorrect.
2. The execution of the Hive command to check for partitioned tables is incorrect, especially in handling the partition specification.

The cause of the bug is related to how the returned output from the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions is handled. The failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly determining the existence of tables, especially when dealing with partitions.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `table_exists` function:
- When checking for the existence of a table, we should parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and compare the table name.
- When checking for the existence of a partitioned table, we should properly format the Hive command and use the correct `partition_spec` function to generate the partition specification.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other class functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_condition = " AND ".join(["{} = '{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} PARTITION ({2});".format(database, table, partition_condition))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with determining the existence of tables and partitioned tables. It correctly processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to check for table existence and constructs the appropriate Hive command when checking for partitioned tables.
