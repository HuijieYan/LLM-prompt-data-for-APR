The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug that causes the failure of the associated test `test_table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClientTest` class. The function fails to handle the case insensitivity in table names. This bug has been reported on GitHub as issue #896, and the proposed fix is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The comparison of table names against the result of `run_hive_cmd` is case-sensitive, leading to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This leads to test failures when table names with different cases are used.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the result of `run_hive_cmd` to a uniform case (e.g., lowercase) before performing the comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the test failures.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This resolves the case sensitivity issue and ensures that the `table_exists` function is case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database.
