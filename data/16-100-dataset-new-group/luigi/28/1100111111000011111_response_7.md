The bug in the function `table_exists` is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. This has been identified in the GitHub issue #896, titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The expected behavior is for the function to be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue's description suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` needs to be updated to make the comparison case insensitive. By converting both `stdout` and `table` to lower case, the function can avoid case sensitivity issues and return the correct result.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected function now converts both `stdout` and `table` to lower case using the `lower()` method, making the comparison case insensitive. This modification aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue and is expected to fix the bug.
