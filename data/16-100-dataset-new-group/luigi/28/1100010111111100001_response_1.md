The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the condition for checking if the table exists. In the first condition, the function checks if the table is in the `stdout` string, but in the second condition, it simply checks if `stdout` is not empty.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that both conditions for checking if the table exists are consistent and accurate. Additionally, we should correct the logic in the second condition to properly check for the existence of a partition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec))

        return bool(stdout)  # Convert the stdout to a boolean value
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the function is consistently checking for the existence of the table and the partition, and the corrected function should pass the failing test cases.
