The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because the check for whether a table exists is case-sensitive, which fails when the table name is not consistently formatted. The test case "test_table_exists" fails because it checks for "mytable" and "MyTable" using the `table_exists` function, which is case-sensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the stdout to the same case (for example, lower case) before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version converts both `table` and `stdout` to lower case before performing the comparison, therefore making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
