The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling the case insensitivity of table names in the 'hive' invocations properly. The function only checks if the table name is in the stdout as an exact match, which leads to failures when the table name is in a different case than expected. This issue was reported on GitHub as it is essential to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to compare the table name with the stdout in a case-insensitive manner to account for the case sensitivity of table names in Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will compare the table name and the stdout in a case-insensitive manner, allowing it to accurately check for table existence regardless of the case. This change addresses the reported GitHub issues and should resolve the failing test cases.
