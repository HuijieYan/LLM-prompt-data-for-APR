The issue with the `table_exists` function is likely due to a case insensitivity problem, as indicated in the GitHub issues. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. However, it does not handle case insensitivity properly, leading to failing tests when the case of the table name does not match that in the Hive database.

To fix this issue, the `table_exists` function should be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the table's existence in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition (%s)""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By performing a case-insensitive comparison using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the function will now handle tables' names with different cases correctly.

This fix addresses the failing tests and meets the expectations of handling case insensitivity described in the GitHub issues.
