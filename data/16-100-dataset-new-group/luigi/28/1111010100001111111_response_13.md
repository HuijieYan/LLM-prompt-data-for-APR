There is an issue in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the buggy function, causing it to fail when checking for the existence of tables that are defined with capitalized names. The function is not case-insensitive, and it compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, resulting in failures when the case of the table name does not match the case of the returned output (which is always lowercase). 

This issue has already been recognized and reported on GitHub, and it has been discussed that the fix for this is to make the `table_exists` method case-insensitive by checking the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase output from the Hive command. The fix has been suggested to add `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to the if conditions. 

The buggy function needs to be fixed to address this case sensitivity issue. We should modify the `table_exists` method to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase output obtained from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Assuming non-empty stdout indicates table existence
```

This corrected version effectively resolves the case sensitivity issue by comparing the lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout from the Hive command, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison as discussed in the GitHub issue.
