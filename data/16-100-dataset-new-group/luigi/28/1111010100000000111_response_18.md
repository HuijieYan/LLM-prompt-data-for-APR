Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The comparison between the `table` and `stdout` is case-sensitive, causing issues with table names that are capitalized.
2. The use of `and` in the return statement may not behave as expected.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing issues with capitalization when checking for an existing table. Hive is case insensitive, so when checking for a table, the function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. The GitHub issue suggests fixing the bug by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` needs to be made case-insensitive using the `lower()` function. Additionally, using `and` in the return statement should be replaced with the `in` operator for a more accurate comparison.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
