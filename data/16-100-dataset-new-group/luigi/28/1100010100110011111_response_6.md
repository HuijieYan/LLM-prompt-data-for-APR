The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The function does not account for case sensitivity, leading to failing test cases when the table name's case does not match the case of the actual table in the database.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This leads to inconsistencies and test failures when the table name's case does not match the case of the actual table in the database.

To fix this bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and consistent with Hive's behavior.

Given the explanation above, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` function, the corrected function is now capable of performing case-insensitive comparisons in line with the expected behavior of Hive.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub. It satisfies the expected input/output values and addresses the case sensitivity problem outlined in the GitHub issue.
