Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for existing tables in Hive. The function is not taking into account the case sensitivity of table names in Hive, which causes the test cases to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not making the comparison case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This leads to false assertions in the test cases when the case of the table name does not match exactly with the case in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other class functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` are used to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table. This change addresses the case sensitivity issue and ensures that the function returns the correct result regardless of the case of the table name.

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
