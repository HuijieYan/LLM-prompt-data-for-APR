The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the conditional check that decides whether a table exists or not. The function is not properly handling the case where the table is found in the stdout. 

The buggy function `table_exists` has two main conditional blocks:

1. If `partition` is None, it runs the command to show tables and checks if the table is in the stdout.
2. If `partition` is not None, it runs the command to show partitions and checks if the stdout is not empty.

Based on the failing tests and expected values, the issue occurs when the table name is found in the stdout, but is not being properly evaluated.

The bug seems to be occurring in the first conditional block. When the table is found in the stdout, the function should return `True` but it's returning `False` instead.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function returns `True` when the table is found in the stdout, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    # Other methods in the class remain unchanged

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```  

This corrected version ensures that the function returns `True` if the table name is found in the stdout, and `False` if it's not found.
