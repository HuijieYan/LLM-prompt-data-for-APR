The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This is causing issues when tables are defined with capitalized names but returned in lower case from Hive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the function uses `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing table names in the Hive database. This change will ensure that the function works as intended and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
