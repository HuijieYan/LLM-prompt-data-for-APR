To fix the bug, it appears that the `table_exists` function is not handling case sensitivity correctly. The function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison in order to make the comparison case insensitive. This fix will make the function more robust and prevent test failures due to case mismatch.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
- In the `table_exists` function, the `stdout` and `table` variables are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
- The use of `bool(stdout)` simplifies the conditional return statement and returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty.

This corrected version will help the `table_exists` function to pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. The comparison with lowercase values will prevent case sensitivity issues and ensure the function works as intended. It also addresses the GitHub issue by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
