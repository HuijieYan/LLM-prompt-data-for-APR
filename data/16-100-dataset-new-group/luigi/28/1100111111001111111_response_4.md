The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it does not handle case-insensitive table name comparisons correctly. This issue was raised in GitHub as issue #896.

The problem lies in the comparison between the table name and the output `stdout`. Hive is case insensitive, so the table names returned in the `stdout` might be in a different case from the input table name. This causes the comparison to fail, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase (or uppercase) for comparison, making the comparison case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions in the class remain unchanged

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons, and the failing test cases should pass. This will also address GitHub issue #896.
