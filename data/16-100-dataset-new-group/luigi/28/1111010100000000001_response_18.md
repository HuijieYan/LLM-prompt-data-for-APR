## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout  # No need for the "and" condition
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Simplify the return statement
    
```

Potential errors in the original function:
1. Incorrect use of string formatting in the `else` branch of the function.
2. Unnecessary use of the `and` condition in the `if` branch of the function.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the original function is caused by incorrect usage of string formatting and unnecessary conditions that complicate the logic.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Fix the string formatting in the `else` branch.
2. Simplify the conditional return statements.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and provides a cleaner and more accurate implementation.
