The buggy function `table_exists` has a case-sensitivity issue when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This is evident from the GitHub issue "hive table_exists should be case insensitive", where it is mentioned that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lower case, leading to test failures.

The buggy function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command and then checks if the table exists based on the output. However, it does not take into account the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, `stdout` and `table` have been converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison to make the table existence check case insensitive.

This corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
