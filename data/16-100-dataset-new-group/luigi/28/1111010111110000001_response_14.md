### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. In the case where a partition is specified, the method constructs a command with a missing "show partitions" clause that causes it to return a wrong answer. Specifically, it fails to include the actual "show partitions" command in the query, which results in incorrect output and hence the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `table_exists` method needs to construct the correct SQL query that includes the "show partitions" command when a partition is specified, and then the method should check the output to correctly determine if the table/partition exists.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```
