The bug in the `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file seems to be related to case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function does not handle case insensitivity correctly when checking for the table's existence.

The failing test case is failing because the `table_exists` function is not handling the case sensitivity properly, and the test is expecting a case-insensitive behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version changes the comparison to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method before making the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive as expected by the failing test cases.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values and types for the given cases. Additionally, the corrected function also addresses the GitHub issue about making `table_exists` case insensitive.
