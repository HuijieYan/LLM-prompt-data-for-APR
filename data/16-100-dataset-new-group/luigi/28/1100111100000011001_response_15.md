The bug in the provided function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called properly, which causes the function to not produce the expected outputs.

The `run_hive_cmd` function is supposed to be called with the `hivecmd` argument, but it is missing in the buggy function. Additionally, in the `else` clause of the buggy function, the `self.partition_spec(partition)` is not being called correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with the correct arguments and that the `self.partition_spec(partition)` is being called correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partitions))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we have called the `run_hive_cmd` function with the appropriate arguments and fixed the call to `self.partition_spec(partition)`. This should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
