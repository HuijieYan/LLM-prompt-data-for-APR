The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class fails to check for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner. This behavior is inconsistent with Hive, which is case-insensitive for table names. The failing test cases and the GitHub issue both suggest that the function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive way.

The bug is caused by the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` with the provided table name. To fix this bug, the function should transform both the `stdout` and the table name to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue raised in GitHub and ensuring that the function passes the failing test cases.

After making this change, the expected input/output values will be satisfied, and the GitHub issue will be resolved.
