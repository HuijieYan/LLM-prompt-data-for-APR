The potential error locations in the buggy function are within the conditions for checking the existence of a table with or without a specified partition, as well as the use of the `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` functions.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `stdout and table in stdout` in the `table_exists` function is not correctly checking the existence of the table, leading to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for checking the existence of the table with or without a specified partition. Additionally, we need to ensure the correct usage of the `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` functions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{0}={1}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- For checking the existence of a table without a specified partition, the query is modified to use `show tables in {database} like "{table}"`, which would better reflect the intention of the original query and improve reliability.
- For checking the existence of a table with a specified partition, the query is built using the provided partition information and the `show partitions` command. The function now returns `bool(stdout)` to represent the existence of the table with the specified partition.

These modifications should address the bug and ensure that the corrected version passes the failing test cases.
