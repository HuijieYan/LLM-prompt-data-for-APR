The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not properly checking if the table exists in the database, especially when a partition is specified. The function is incorrectly calling the `run_hive_cmd` function and processing its output.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect formatting of the SQL command used to check for the existence of a partitioned table. 

A strategy to fix the bug would be to properly construct the SQL command based on whether a partition is specified or not, and correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = ', '.join(['{} = "{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_string))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the SQL commands are constructed properly based on whether a partition is specified or not. The output of `run_hive_cmd` is correctly processed to determine if the table exists. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
