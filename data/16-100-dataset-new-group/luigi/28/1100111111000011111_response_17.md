# The bug
The `table_exists` function is not case insensitive, causing issues when comparing table names that are returned in lowercase from Hive.

# The fix
To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

# The corrected code
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
With the modified function, the comparison is now case insensitive for the table name.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
