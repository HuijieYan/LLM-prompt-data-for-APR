The buggy function `table_exists` fails the test for the `hive.py` module.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to case sensitivity when comparing table names with the output obtained from the hive command.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name with the output from the hive command. This causes the test to fail when checking for existing tables, especially when the table names are in different cases.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the comparison logic to convert both the table name and the output from the hive command to the same case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        table_lower = table.lower()
        return any(table_lower == line.strip().lower() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        table_lower = table.lower()
        return any(table_lower == line.strip().lower() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

This corrected version uses the `any` function to check if the lowercase version of the table name exists in the lowercase version of the output obtained from the hive command. This should make the comparison case insensitive as required.
