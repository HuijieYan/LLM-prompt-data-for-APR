Explanation:

1. The bug in the original function lies in the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner. The function does not take case into consideration when comparing the table name in the output. This causes the test case to fail when expecting a case-insensitive comparison.

2. The cause of the bug is that the table name is not being converted to lowercase for comparison, leading to false negatives when checking for table existence.

3. To fix the bug, the corrected function now performs a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

4. By using table.lower() in stdout.lower(), we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

5. The corrected version of the function is provided above. It addresses the case sensitivity issue and properly compares the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
