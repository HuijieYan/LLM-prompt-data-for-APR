The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test cases in the `hive_test.py` file. The issue is related to the case sensitivity of table names. The `table_exists` function is not handling case-insensitive table name checks properly, leading to failing test cases. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive and suggests fixing it by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to use case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected function now performs a case-insensitive comparison by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before checking for table existence. This fix addresses the case sensitivity issue and should make the function pass the failing test cases.
