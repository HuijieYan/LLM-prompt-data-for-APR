Error Locations:
- The bug in the table_exists function could be caused by the comparison between the table name and the entries in stdout. The bug might be due to a case-sensitive comparison.

Cause of the Bug:
- The failing test case checks for case insensitivity when testing if a table exists. The issue raised on GitHub suggests that Hive is case-insensitive, returning table names in lower case, which causes the test to fail when expecting a case-sensitive comparison. The bug is confirmed by the failing test, which expects the table_exist function to be case-insensitive, but the function currently uses a case-sensitive comparison.

Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to make the comparison case-insensitive, as suggested in both GitHub issues. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the entries in stdout to lowercase for comparison.

Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
