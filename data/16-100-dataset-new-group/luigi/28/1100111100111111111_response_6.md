Based on the failed test cases and the GitHub issues, it appears that the bug is related to the case sensitivity of table names in the `table_exists` function. The existing implementation of the function does not account for case insensitivity, leading to failures when checking for table existence with different cases. The fix should include checking `table.lower()` in `stdout.lower()` to make the comparison case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By performing a case insensitive comparison between `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, the corrected function should address the case sensitivity issue and pass the failing tests. This fix aligns with the suggestions in the GitHub issue to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
