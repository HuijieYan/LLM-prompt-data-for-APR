Based on the analysis, it appears that the buggy function is not correctly handling the partition parameter. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with the wrong parameters when the partition is not None. 

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to correctly construct the command for `run_hive_cmd` depending on whether the partition is provided or not.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_filter = ' and '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_filter))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version handles both cases where the partition is provided and where it is not, by constructing the appropriate command for `run_hive_cmd`. This should fulfill the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
