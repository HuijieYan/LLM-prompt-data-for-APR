Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, the cause of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` is case sensitive. This is due to `table` not being converted to lowercase before comparison with `stdout`. The failing test cases demonstrate this issue by failing when checking for a table's existence in a case-insensitive manner.

To fix the bug, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` needs to be made case-insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table name with the `stdout`, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases. This also addresses the GitHub issue regarding making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
