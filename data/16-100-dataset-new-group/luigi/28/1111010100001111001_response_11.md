There are two major issues with the buggy function:

1. In the `table_exists` function, the logic to check for the existence of a table is incorrect. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and then checks the output, but the logic for checking the output is flawed.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function is invoked within the `table_exists` function, but its implementation is not visible in the provided code.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the existence of a table should be revised. It should check for a clean, exact match of the table name in the output of the Hive command.

Additionally, assuming that the `run_hive_cmd` function simply returns the output of the specified Hive command, the logic for processing the output may need to be adjusted.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                    ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return True if stdout else False
```

In this corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` function is assumed to return the exact output of the specified Hive command. The use of `show tables in {database}` instead of `show tables like "{table}"` will specifically search for the table within the given database. The function then checks for an exact match of the table name in the output obtained from the Hive commands. If partition is not `None`, the logic for processing the output has been simplified to return `True` if `stdout` has content, and `False` if it does not. This should address the issues and satisfy the expected input/output values.
