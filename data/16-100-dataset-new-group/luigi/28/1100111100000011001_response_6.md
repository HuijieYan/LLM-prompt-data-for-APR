The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without referencing the class it belongs to. This means that the function is being called as a standalone function rather than as a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. This is likely the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `run_hive_cmd` function as a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. To do this, we will need to reference it using `self.run_hive_cmd` within the `table_exists` function.

Additionally, in the else block, the call to `self.partition_spec(partition)` is also missing the reference to the `HiveCommandClient` class. It should be called as `self.partition_spec(self, partition)`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def run_hive_cmd(self, hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(self, partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With these changes, the `run_hive_cmd` function is now correctly called as a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which should fix the bug.
