The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not check for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of the Hive command. This causes issues when the case of the table name in the code does not match the case of the table name in the Hive database.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, resolving the issue described in the GitHub posts.
