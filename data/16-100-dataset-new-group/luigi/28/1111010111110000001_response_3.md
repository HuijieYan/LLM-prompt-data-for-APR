The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class needs to be fixed. The error message from the failing test indicates that in the test case where the table exists, the function is returning `False` instead of `True`.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the conditional statements in the `if` and `else` blocks. The logic of checking the condition and returning the result is flawed.

The cause of the bug is that, when checking whether a table exists with the `table_exists` function, the logic is inverted. When the table exists, the function should return `True`, but it's currently returning `False`.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the logic within the `table_exists` function to correctly return `True` when a table exists and `False` when it does not exist.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout is not None
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1};""".format(database, table))
    
            return stdout is not None
```
