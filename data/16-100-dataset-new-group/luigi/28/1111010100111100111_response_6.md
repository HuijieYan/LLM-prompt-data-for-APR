Based on the information provided, the bug is due to case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. It fails to account for case differences in table names, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout != ""
```

In the updated version, we use the `map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to lowercase all table names returned in the `stdout` and then check if the lowercase version of the provided `table` is in the lowercased `stdout`. Also, we simplified the check for `partition` as `stdout` contains the partition information and we only need to check if it's not empty.

This should resolve the issue of case sensitivity and allow the `table_exists` function to return the correct results for both lowercase and uppercase table names.
