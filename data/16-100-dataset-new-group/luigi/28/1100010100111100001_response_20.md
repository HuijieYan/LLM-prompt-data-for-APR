The bug in the function `table_exists` is causing the test cases to fail. The issue seems to be with the if-else condition within the function. It incorrectly checks for the presence of `table` in the output of `run_hive_cmd` and returns `False` if it doesn't find the table. The bug is also related to case sensitivity because the "OK\nmytable" is considered a string where "mytable" is a separate entry, which leads to the expected values in the returning test cases being incorrect.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_list = stdout.split('\n')

        return table in table_list
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the function splits the `stdout` into a list of tables, and then checks for the presence of the `table` in that list. This ensures that the comparison is done correctly without being affected by the test case sensitivity. Additionally, the `stdout` is checked using the `bool` function for the presence of any non-empty response.
