To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make sure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.

This correction ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, which addresses the issue reported in GitHub. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.

Additionally, the fix corresponds to the GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive", and it aligns with the suggested strategy of checking stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues.
