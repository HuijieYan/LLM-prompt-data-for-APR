The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the tables returned from the Hive command. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names are different only in cases.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the tables returned from the Hive command to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition 
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the GitHub issues #896 and the issue related to case insensitivity in `table_exists` function.
