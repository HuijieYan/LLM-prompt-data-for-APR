The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not correctly handling the case when the `stdout` value is "OK" because it is not properly checking for an exact match in the string. Instead, it only checks if the `table` variable is in the `stdout` string.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to check for an exact match in the `stdout` string when it is "OK" and also handle the case where the table name is not found in the `stdout` string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return "OK" in stdout.split("\n")

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return "OK" in stdout.split("\n")
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function has been modified to split the `stdout` string using the newline character and checks if the "OK" string is present in the resulting list. This approach ensures that the function returns the correct boolean values for the given test cases.
