There are two issues with the `table_exists` function: 

1. The function is not case-insensitive, causing tests to fail when checking for table existence.
2. The function is not interacting correctly with the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bugs, the following changes need to be made:

1. Make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by comparing `table.lower()` with `stdout.lower()` instead of `table` with `stdout`.
2. Replace the method `run_hive_cmd` with the one that interacts correctly with the `table_exists` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now be case-insensitive and should correctly interact with the other functions. This corrected version resolves the issue posted on GitHub as well.
