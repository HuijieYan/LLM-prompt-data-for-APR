The buggy function `table_exists` is not returning the expected results for the given test cases. It is failing to correctly detect the existence of a table in the database.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It is not checking for the table name in the output in a way that accounts for different formatting and cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the way the function checks the output of `run_hive_cmd` to accurately determine the existence of the table.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".
                              format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` by newline and check for the table in the returned list. In the case of partitions, we directly return the boolean value of `stdout`. This will accurately determine the existence of the table in the database based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
