The bug in the provided function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called correctly, and the formatting of the query strings is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being used to execute the Hive queries properly. Additionally, the formatting of the query strings is incorrect, which would cause the queries to fail.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called with the correct query strings, and the query strings themselves should be properly formatted.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like \'{1}\';'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == 'OK'
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In the corrected version:
- The `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct query strings.
- The query strings are formatted using the correct syntax to execute Hive queries.
- The `stdout` variable is stripped of whitespace and then checked for the expected values.
