The issue in the buggy function is that it does not handle cases where the `stdout` contains both the `OK` message and the table name on the same line. This results in incorrect outputs from the function, leading to failing test cases.

The bug occurs when the function checks whether the table exists in the database. It checks the returned value of `stdout` to determine the existence of the table. However, the function does not correctly parse the `stdout` in cases where it contains both the `OK` message and the table name on the same line.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly parse the `stdout` and handle cases where the table name is included in the same line as the `OK` message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions are not shown for brevity

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
            return table in stdout.split('\n')  # Check if the table name is present in the output
        
        else:
            partition_spec_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_spec_output))
        
            return table in stdout.split('\n')  # Check if the table name is present in the output
```

This corrected version of the function correctly splits the `stdout` by newlines and checks if the table name is present in the output. This will handle cases where the table name is included in the same line as the `OK` message, ensuring the correct behavior of the function.
