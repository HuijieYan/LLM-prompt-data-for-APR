Potential Bug:
The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the database.

Explanation of Bug:
The function checks if a table exists in the database by running a Hive command and then checking if the table name is present in the output. However, the comparison is case-sensitive, which leads to issues when the table name provided does not match the case of the actual table name in the database.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command needs to be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)"""
                % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )

            return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout from the Hive command are converted to lowercase before comparison, resolving the case sensitivity issue when checking for the existence of tables in the database.
