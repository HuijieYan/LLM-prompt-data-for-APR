The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it fails to check for case insensitivity in table names when using the `run_hive_cmd` function to check for table existence in a Hive database.

The bug causes the test cases to fail because the function `table_exists` does not account for case insensitivity in table names, which leads to false negatives in the test results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison to use `table.lower()`, we ensure that the table name is converted to lowercase for comparison, making the check case insensitive.

With this correction, the failing test cases should now pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

This correction addresses the bug and ensures that the `table_exists` function is now case insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue.
