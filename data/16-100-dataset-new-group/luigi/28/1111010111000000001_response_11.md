Upon analysis, the buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a couple of issues:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being used without being imported or defined within the `HiveCommandClient` class.
2. In the `else` block, the `run_hive_cmd` call with the SQL query is not formatted correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not available within the class, and the SQL query in the `else` block is not formatted correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `run_hive_cmd` function or define it within the `HiveCommandClient` class. Additionally, the SQL query in the `else` block needs to be formatted correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we assume that the `run_hive_cmd` function is a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class, so we use `self.run_hive_cmd` to call the function. Additionally, the formatting of the SQL query in the `else` block has been updated to be consistent and correctly follow the SQL syntax.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
