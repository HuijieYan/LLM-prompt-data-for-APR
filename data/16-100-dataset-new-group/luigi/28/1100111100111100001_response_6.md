The bug in the function `table_exists` stems from the conditions for checking the existence of a table. The condition that checks for the presence of a table in the stdout is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect return values.

The bug is caused by the logic in the `table_exists` function. In the first condition, the function checks whether the `table` is present in the `stdout` string. However, in the second condition, the function only checks whether the `stdout` string is non-empty, not whether the `table` is present in it.

To fix the bug, we should modify the second condition to also check for the presence of the `table` in the `stdout` string.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout  # Fix: Check if the table is in the stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return table in stdout  # Fix: Check if the table is in the stdout
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly check for the presence of the table in the `stdout` string in both conditions, which should address the bug and make the failing tests pass.
