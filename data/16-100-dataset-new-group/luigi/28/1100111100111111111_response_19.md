The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking the existence of a table. The function fails to account for case differences in the table name, resulting in the tests failing when the given table names are in different cases compared to the results from Hive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This would make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # the fixed function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing both the table name and the output from Hive in lowercase, the function becomes case-insensitive and will pass the failing tests. This solution also aligns with the GitHub issues raised regarding the case-sensitivity problem.
