The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not check for case insensitivity, causing tests to fail when checking for an existing table with different cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
