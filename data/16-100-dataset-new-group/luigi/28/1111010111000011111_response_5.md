The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is expected to return `True` if the table exists in the specified database and `False` if it doesn't. However, there are two main issues with the current implementation:

1. The function does not handle case insensitivity. It should check the table name in a case-insensitive manner due to the case insensitivity of Hive.
2. The logic for checking the existence of a table is not correct for the second case because it checks whether `stdout` is empty instead of checking if the table exists.

To fix these issues, the following strategy can be used:

1. Modify the function to check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner by converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it.

2. Update the logic to check whether the table exists, which involves checking if the table name is present in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables'.format(database))

            return table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the function checks for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase. It also uses the `split()` method to correctly identify if the table name is present in the output list.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided and resolve the GitHub issue regarding case insensitivity.
