The problem with the `table_exists` function is that it is not using the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly when a partition is specified. The function is also incorrectly handling the return value of `run_hive_cmd` in the case where a partition is not specified. Additionally, the test is failing because of incorrect return values from `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make sure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct parameters and handle the return value appropriately in both cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
    
        if stdout.strip():
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct parameters when a partition is specified. We also handle the return value from `run_hive_cmd` in an appropriate way, considering the whitespace around the output. This should resolve the issues with the original buggy function and make the failing test cases pass.
