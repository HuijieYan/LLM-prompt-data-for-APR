The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions. The function checks if a table exists in the given database, and if a partition is provided, it also checks if the partition exists.

The bug seems to be related to the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is called and the construction of the command string for checking the partition.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function for checking the table existence.
2. Incorrect construction of the command string for checking the partition existence.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not constructing the correct command string for the `run_hive_cmd` function, and the function is not handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function properly.

To fix the bug, we should construct the command strings properly and handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to properly check for table and partition existence.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_vals = ",".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            cmd = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_vals)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. Removed the semicolon from the end of the command strings.
2. Constructed the partition command string using the input partition values.
3. Used a boolean check for the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine the existence of the table/partition.

This should fix the bug by correctly constructing the command strings and handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
