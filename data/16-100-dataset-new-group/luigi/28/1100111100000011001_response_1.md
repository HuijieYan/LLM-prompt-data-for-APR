The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the `run_hive_cmd` function properly and does not construct the command string properly when the partition is not None. Additionally, it does not handle the stdout output correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not construct the command string properly when the partition is not None, leading to incorrect stdout output. The function also does not handle the stdout output correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we need to properly construct the command string when the partition is not None and handle the stdout output to determine the correct return value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout == 'OK'
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version properly constructs the command string when the partition is not None and handles the stdout output to determine the correct return value. It should satisfy all the expected input/output values.
