To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the string from stdout to lowercase before comparison.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now return the correct results and pass the failing tests. This fix also resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.

This modification will ensure that comparisons between the table name and the output from Hive are case insensitive, aligning with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issues.
