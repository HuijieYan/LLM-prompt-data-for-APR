Based on the provided information and the failing test cases, it seems the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database.

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class seems to compare the table name with the result returned from the Hive command without converting both to either lowercase or uppercase. In certain cases, this can lead to incorrect comparison results due to case sensitivity.

The failing test cases and GitHub issues indicate that the table names are sometimes returned in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail when expecting a case-insensitive match.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the result from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
- Using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the result from the Hive command to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
- The corrected function should address the case sensitivity issue and pass the failing test cases.

After applying this fix, the `table_exists` function should no longer produce false negatives due to case sensitivity.

This solution addresses the bug and the related GitHub issues by making the comparison case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue discussions.
