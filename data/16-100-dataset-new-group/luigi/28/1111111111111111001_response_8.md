The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way it constructs the query to check for the existence of a table. It fails to properly handle the case when a table name is contained within a larger string, causing false positives to be returned.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to use a more robust method of checking for table existence. We should also ensure that the function correctly handles partitioned tables when provided with a partition parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')  # Split the result by newlines

    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)  # Call the partition_spec method with the partition parameter
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty

```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It properly handles both regular and partitioned tables, ensuring that the table existence check is accurate.
