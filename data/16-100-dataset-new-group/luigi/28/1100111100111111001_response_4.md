To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is returning the correct value and that the comparison with the table name is case-insensitive. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we are converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make it a case-insensitive comparison.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
