The buggy function `table_exists` from the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. 

The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly to the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which may cause a mismatch due to case sensitivity issues in Hive. This bug has been reported in GitHub issue #896.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them. This change will resolve the case sensitivity issue and ensure the function returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the function `table_exists`:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function will compare both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the bug reported in GitHub issue #896.
