The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug in case sensitivity due to different capitalization between the input `table` and the actual table name returned in `stdout`. This is a known issue in the GitHub reports titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive." The proposed fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `table` and `stdout` are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function and then checked for presence of the table name. This is applied consistently for both cases, making the function case insensitive. This fix addresses the reported issue and aligns with the expected input/output values.
