Based on the analysis of the buggy function and its input/output variable values, the primary cause of the bug is the incorrect comparison of the stdout variable with the table name. Additionally, the run_hive_cmd function may not be returning data in the expected format, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, the comparison of stdout with the table name needs to be refined to accommodate potential formatting differences.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() == table  # Updated comparison after stripping whitespace
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ''  # Checking if stdout is not empty
```

The corrected version refines the comparison of the stdout variable to properly handle potential formatting issues, and also checks if stdout is not empty when querying for partitions.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
