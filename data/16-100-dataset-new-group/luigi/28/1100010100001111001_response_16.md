The buggy function is `table_exists`, which checks if a table or partition exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to execute Hive commands and check the existence of the table or partition. The bug appears to be related to how the stdout of the `run_hive_cmd` method is being processed.

The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. In the first `if` block, checking `stdout and table in stdout` might not be handling the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly.
2. In the second `else` block, the return statements are not handling the stdout of `run_hive_cmd` correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` method, leading to incorrect checks for the existence of tables or partitions.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` method and provide the correct checks for table or partition existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In the corrected version, the `stdout` is stripped and then directly compared to the table name when checking for table existence. In the case of checking for partition existence, the `stdout` is also stripped and converted to a boolean value to check its existence.
