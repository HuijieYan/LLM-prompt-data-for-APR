The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner. The expected behavior is for the function to return `True` if the table exists in the database, regardless of the case of the table name. However, the current implementation is case-sensitive, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, modify the function to compare the table name in lowercase with the contents of `stdout` also converted to lowercase.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # ... (other methods and functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                  (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the contents of `stdout`, making the comparison case-insensitive.

This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue #896, where the `table_exists` function was failing due to case sensitivity.
