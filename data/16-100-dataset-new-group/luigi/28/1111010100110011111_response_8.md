The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity, causing the test cases to fail. The function is currently comparing the table name directly with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which may not match due to case differences.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase for comparison. This will ensure that the function is case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the case sensitivity issue by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison. This change allows the function to pass the failing test cases and satisfies the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub pertaining to making `table_exists` case insensitive.
