The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it is not returning the expected values for different test cases. The issue with the buggy function is that it is always returning `False` when it should return `True` in some cases.

The problem lies in the condition at the beginning of the `table_exists` function. When the `stdout` is empty, it should return `False`, otherwise it should return `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to check for an empty string instead of a None value and then return the results accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout != "" and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout != ""
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
