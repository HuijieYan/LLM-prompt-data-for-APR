The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for cases where the table name might be in a different case than the one provided. This is causing test failures when the table name casing does not match exactly with the stdout from the hive command.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison to make it case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the lower-cased table name with the lower-cased stdout, making it case insensitive.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub, and the function now satisfies all the expected input/output values mentioned.
