The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not case insensitive, leading to tests failing when the table name case does not match the case in `stdout`. This was an issue in older versions where it checked for the existence of a string "does not exist" or "Table not found", but now it directly checks if the table name is in `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the function works as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version will handle the case sensitivity issue and should pass the failing test cases, resolving the related GitHub issues.
