The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table name with the tables returned by Hive. This results in incorrect behavior when the table names have different case formats. The behavior change was indicated in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase and then compare it with the tables returned by Hive in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return True if stdout else False
```

The correction includes converting the table name to lowercase using `table.lower()` and comparing it with the tables returned by Hive using `map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to perform a case-insensitive comparison. This addresses the issue of case sensitivity as indicated in the GitHub issue.
