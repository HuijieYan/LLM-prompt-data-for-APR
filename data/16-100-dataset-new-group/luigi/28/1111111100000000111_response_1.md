## Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the `table` and the `stdout` is case-sensitive, which causes the test to fail when tables are defined with capitalized names.
2. The `table_exists` function does not handle case-insensitive table existence checks, causing issues when checking for tables with different capitalization.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the available tables in the database. Due to Hive being case insensitive, tables with different capitalization are not being accurately checked for existence.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase for comparison with the tables in the database. This will make the existence check case-insensitive.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
