Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for existing tables in Hive. The issue on GitHub also supports this, indicating that the function should be case insensitive.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the function checking for an exact match of the table name in the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. Therefore, the suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to check for the presence of the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the check for the presence of the table name is modified to ensure case insensitivity by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This modification aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
