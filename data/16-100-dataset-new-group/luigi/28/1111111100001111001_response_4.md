The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be with the `run_hive_cmd` call in the else block where the `partition` parameter is not `None`. The `self.partition_spec(partition)` argument is being passed incorrectly.

The buggy function is not correctly constructing the command for showing partitions in the `else` block. The `self.partition_spec(partition)` call should be replaced with `partition` as it's already constructed.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the else block to correctly use the `partition` variable and pass it in the command. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2};'.format(database, table, partition))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
