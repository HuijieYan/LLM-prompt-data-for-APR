The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not take into account the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. The expected values of the test cases indicate that the `table_exists` function should check for the existence of a table irrespective of the case of the table name. The GitHub issues also confirm that the function needs to be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive to ensure case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive, the function will now be case insensitive, as expected by the test cases and GitHub issues.
