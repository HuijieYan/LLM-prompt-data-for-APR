The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be that it doesn't account for case sensitivity in table names when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The bug is related to GitHub issues #896 and #898, where it's mentioned that sometimes tables are defined in capitalized format, but Hive treats them as lower case, causing failures when checking if a table exists.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case for case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` is used to perform case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive. This change addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensures that the function correctly identifies whether a table exists in the Hive database regardless of case sensitivity.
