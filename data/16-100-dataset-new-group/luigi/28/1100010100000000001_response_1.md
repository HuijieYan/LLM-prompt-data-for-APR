## Corrected version of the function
```python

# The corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it constructs the Hive commands incorrectly and does not handle the output properly. The `show tables` command does not specify the database correctly and the conditional checks for the presence of output are not handled properly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct syntax for the Hive commands, including specifying the database in the `show tables` command.
2. Simplify the conditional checks for the presence of output.

### Changes made in the corrected version:
1. Modified the syntax for `show tables` and `show partitions` to ensure the correct database is used.
2. Simplified the conditional checks to directly return the result obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

By making these changes, the function now properly checks for the existence of a table or partition in the specified database.
