The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the tables in the database. The issue on GitHub also confirms this, and it is suggested to fix it by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To resolve this bug, we need to modify the comparison between `stdout` and the table name to perform a case-insensitive check. We can achieve this by converting both `stdout` and the table name to lowercase using the `lower()` method and then checking for the presence of the lowercase table name in the lowercase `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This change makes the comparison case-insensitive, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
