The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. This bug was identified and reported in GitHub issue #896.

The function `table_exists` should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. The expected behavior is to check if the table name in `stdout` matches the lowercase version of the input table name.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should be updated to include case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By using the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the failing test cases provided should now pass. This fixes the bug and satisfies the expected input/output values as well as resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
