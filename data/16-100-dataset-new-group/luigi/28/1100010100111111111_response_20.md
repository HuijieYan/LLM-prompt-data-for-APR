The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing test failures due to case sensitivity. The function is failing to recognize tables that have different cases from the input table name. The suggested fix is to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

* Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function's failure to account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the table names returned in the output. This issue is reflected in the failing tests where the function returns False even when the table exists with different case.

* Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner when checking if it exists in the output. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lower (or upper) case for comparison.

* Given the information provided and the bug fix strategy, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With the corrected version of the function, the case-insensitive comparison ensures that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table in the hive database. This fix aligns with the suggested strategy to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
