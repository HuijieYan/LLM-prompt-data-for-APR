The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing the test to fail when the table name is not in the expected case. This was reported as Github Issue #896, and the proposed solution is to make `table_exists` case-insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the `stdout`. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `stdout`, making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive. This should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported in GitHub.
