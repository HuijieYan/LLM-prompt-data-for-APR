The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table names in Hive. The function is not checking for case insensitive table existence, which causes issues when the table names are in different cases. The expected behavior is for the function to return True if the table exists, regardless of the case of the table name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that both the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
