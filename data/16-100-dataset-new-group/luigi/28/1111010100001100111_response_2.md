The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class appears to have a bug where it's not case insensitive when checking for table existence, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

The cause of the bug can be inferred from the GitHub issue where it is mentioned that tables defined with capitalized names are being returned in lowercase from Hive. This causes the equality check to fail, resulting in incorrect behavior. The correct behavior should involve converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for the comparison.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` variable to lowercase before comparing them.

Below is the corrected version of the function considering the fix described in the GitHub issue:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    
```
In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison. This should ensure case insensitivity and address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
