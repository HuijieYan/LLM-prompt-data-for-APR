To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. We will convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison to ensure the comparison is not affected by case sensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before the comparison, resolving the case sensitivity issue and producing the expected output values. This fix addresses the GitHub issue of making the `table_exists` function case insensitive and should pass the failing tests.
