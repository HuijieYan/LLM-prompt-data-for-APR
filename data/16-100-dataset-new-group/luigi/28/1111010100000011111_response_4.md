The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly. This has been identified in the GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".

The bug occurs when checking for existing tables where the table names are defined in capitalized format, but Hive returns the names in lowercase. This causes the test to fail. The proposed fix is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be modified to ensure it is case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now performs a case-insensitive comparison of the table name and the output from Hive, preventing the test from failing due to case differences.
