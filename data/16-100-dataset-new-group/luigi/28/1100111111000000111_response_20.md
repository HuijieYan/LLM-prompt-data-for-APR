The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive, which causes a test to fail when checking for an existing table with different cases. The issue on GitHub also mentions this problem and suggests a fix to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
    
```

By modifying the function to compare the table name and the stdout in a case-insensitive manner with `lower()`, we ensure that the function is now case insensitive and fixes the bug.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
