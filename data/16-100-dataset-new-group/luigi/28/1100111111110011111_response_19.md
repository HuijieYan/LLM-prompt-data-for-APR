## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Explanation
The bug in the original function was that it did not lowercase the comparison strings before checking for the existence of the table. This resulted in case-sensitivity issues when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The corrected version of the function addresses this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

The corrected version of the function ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issues #896 and #899, and will now pass the failing tests provided.
