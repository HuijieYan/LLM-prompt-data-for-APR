The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be in the condition for checking if the table exists in the `stdout`. The function returns `False` when `stdout` is "OK", which is incorrect.

The bug seems to be in the condition where it is checking for `stdout` to be not empty, but the comparison is not taking into account the specific content of `stdout`.

To fix the bug, we need to check for the table name in the `stdout` as a whole string, rather than just a boolean check on the presence of `stdout`. Additionally, the function should be case-insensitive when checking the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing tests.
