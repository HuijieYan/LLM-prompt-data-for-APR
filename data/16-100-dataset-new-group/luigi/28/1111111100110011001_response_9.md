The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle the case where the `run_hive_cmd` function returns data in multiple lines. The function only checks if the table name is present in a single line of the output, but in some cases the output may contain the table name in multiple lines. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check if the table name is present in any line of the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other class functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
            return any([table in line for line in stdout.split('\n') if line.strip() != ''])
```

In the corrected version, for the second case, where the function checks if the table name is present in multiple lines, it uses list comprehension to split the `stdout` by newline characters, and then checks if the table name is present in any of the lines.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
