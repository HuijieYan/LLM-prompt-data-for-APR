The potential error locations within the `table_exists` function are:
1. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` may be evaluating to `False` when it should be `True`.
2. The formatting of the output may not be handled correctly, leading to incorrect evaluation of whether a table exists or not.


The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function properly. The `run_hive_cmd` function returns the results of the command it runs, and the `table_exists` function tries to parse this output and return `True` or `False` based on whether the table exists or not. However, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is not handling the output correctly, leading to incorrect results. The incorrect results are causing the test cases to fail.


To fix the bug, we need to handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function properly and ensure that the condition to check whether the table exists is handled correctly.


Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}".format(database, table))
            return self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout.splitlines()
```

In the corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` function output is properly handled. The `splitlines()` function is used to split the output into lines, and then the presence of the table or partition is checked in the list of lines. This ensures that the results are evaluated correctly.
