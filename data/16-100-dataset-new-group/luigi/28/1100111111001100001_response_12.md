The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition to check for the existence of a table is not correctly handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to incorrect results in the test cases.

The potential error is in the conditional statements that check the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` correctly, leading to wrong results being returned for table existence.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` and compare it with the table name to determine the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other member functions here...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            # Check if the table name is in the stdout, ignoring case
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])))
            # Check if the partition exists in the stdout
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test.
