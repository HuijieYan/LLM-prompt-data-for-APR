The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the conditional check and the `stdout` variable. Based on the failing tests and the provided runtime values, it appears that the conditional checks for `stdout` are not handling the expected values correctly.

In Case 1 and Case 2, the problem is that the `stdout` variable is not being split correctly to check if the table actually exists. The current implementation simply checks if the table name is in the entire `stdout` string, rather than splitting it and checking each entry.

In Case 3 and Case 6, the issue seems to be with the call to `self.partition_spec(partition)`. The mocked `self.partition_spec` function does not return the correct value, leading to a wrong `stdout` value, ultimately causing the `table_exists` function to return the wrong result.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditional check for `stdout` to properly split the string and perform the check on each entry. Additionally, ensuring that the `self.partition_spec` function is returning the expected value when called with the `partition` argument is crucial for the correctness of the function.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partition_string = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_string))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `stdout` is split into individual lines before checking if the table exists. Additionally, the call to `self.partition_spec(partition)` is used to get the correct partition string. These changes should address the bug and make the `table_exists` function pass the failing tests.
