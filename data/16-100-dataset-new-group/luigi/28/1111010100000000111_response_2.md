Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The function is not handling case insensitivity properly, leading to test failures when checking for an existing table.
- The function is not using case insensitivity while comparing the table name with the output from the `show tables` or `show partitions` commands.

Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing table names. This causes issues when checking for the existence of a table with different cases (e.g., 'FooBar' vs 'foobar').

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from the `show tables` or `show partitions` commands to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) for comparison.

Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the output from the `show tables` or `show partitions` commands are converted to lower case for comparison. This makes the comparison case insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
