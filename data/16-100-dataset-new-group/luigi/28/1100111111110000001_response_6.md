The bug occurs in the table_exists function of the HiveCommandClient class. When a partition is provided, the function uses run_hive_cmd to check if the table exists, but it uses self.partition_spec(partition) incorrectly to construct the Hive command. This leads to incorrect output and the function returns False even when the table exists.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the Hive command constructed inside the table_exists function is valid and correctly checks for the table existence and partitions, if provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions remain unchanged
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = ' and '.join(['{}=\'{}\''.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_query))
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

With this corrected version, the function will construct the Hive commands correctly based on whether a partition is provided or not, and the test should pass without any assertion errors.
