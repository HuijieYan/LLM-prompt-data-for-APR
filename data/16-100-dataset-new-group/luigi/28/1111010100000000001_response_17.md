The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a subclass of `HiveClient`. 

The potential error locations in the function are the conditional statements and the `run_hive_cmd` function calls.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements check for the presence of `stdout` instead of the actual results of the `run_hive_cmd` function calls. So, even if the commands fail, the function may return `True`. Also, the `run_hive_cmd` function calls are not handling exceptions properly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statements to check the actual results of the `run_hive_cmd` function calls, and handle any exceptions that may occur during the function calls.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        try:
            if partition is None:
                stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
                return table in stdout
            else:
                stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
                return bool(stdout)
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle the exception, e.g., log the error and return False
            return False
```
In the corrected version, we have added a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the `run_hive_cmd` function calls. We have modified the conditional statements to return the actual results of the `run_hive_cmd` function calls. Additionally, we have used `bool(stdout)` to explicitly convert the `stdout` to a boolean value.
