The buggy function `table_exists` currently has a bug where it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes issues when a table is defined with capitalized names and the function checks for them using lower case names. To fix this bug, the function needs to use case-insensitive comparison when checking for the table's existence.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the issue:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, when checking for the existence of a table, both the table name and the table names in the stdout are converted to lower case using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

The corrected version satisfies all the cases specified, including case-insensitive comparison, and resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function for Hive tables.
