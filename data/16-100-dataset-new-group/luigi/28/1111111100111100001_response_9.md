To fix the bug in the table_exists function, we need to ensure that it correctly checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The bug is likely in the conditional statements where the function checks the return value of the run_hive_cmd function. The issue is likely related to string comparison or the formatting of the output.

Based on the error messages and the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the case-insensitive comparison of table names.

To fix the bug, we should modify the table_exists function to handle case-insensitive comparison of table names and properly format the output of the run_hive_cmd function.

Below is the corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0}'.format(database))
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            partition_clause = ', '.join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_clause))
            return len(stdout.strip()) > 0
```

This corrected version takes into account case-insensitive comparison of table names and formats the output of the run_hive_cmd function correctly. With these modifications, the function should now pass the failing tests.
