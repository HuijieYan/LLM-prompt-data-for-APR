The buggy function is the `table_exists` method in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module. This method is failing the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` test cases. The main issue is that the function incorrectly handles the `stdout` variable, which should indicate the existence of the table. 

The first bug can be found in the `else` block, where the function checks if `stdout` exists and always returns `True` for any non-empty `stdout`. This leads to incorrect behavior and causes the test to fail.

Furthermore, the function does not handle the case-insensitive matching of the `table` variable, which leads to a failure in the test.

To fix the bug, the `if` block and the condition `stdout and table in stdout` need to be updated to handle case-insensitive table names. The second issue can be resolved by using the `lower()` method to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With these corrections, the failing tests should pass successfully.
