The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be with the conditional checks and the usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function. One potential cause could be the mishandling of the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to incorrect conditional checks.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is returning the expected output, and the conditional checks are correctly comparing the stdout. Additionally, the construction of the command strings should be reviewed to ensure they are correctly formatted.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions in the class

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return bool(stdout)  # Changed to check if stdout has any content
        else:
            partition_clause = ' and '.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            cmd = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_clause)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

            return bool(stdout)  # Changed to check if stdout has any content
```

In the corrected version, the function checks if the `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd` has any content by using `bool(stdout)` rather than checking for specific values. This ensures that the function returns the correct boolean value based on the presence of output from `run_hive_cmd`.
