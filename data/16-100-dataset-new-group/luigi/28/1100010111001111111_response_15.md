There is a bug in the `table_exists` function of the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file that is causing the test cases to fail. The bug is related to case sensitivity when comparing table names in Hive.

The issue has been identified in a GitHub issue (#896) where it is explained that table names are sometimes defined as capitalized, rather than lower case underscored names. Hive is case insensitive, so it returns table names as lower case, causing the test to fail.

The buggy function does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to failed test cases.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to either lower or upper case before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

By comparing both the table name and the stdout from Hive in a case-insensitive manner, we can ensure that the `table_exists` function works correctly and resolves the issue raised on GitHub.
