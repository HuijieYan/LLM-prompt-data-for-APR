The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect check for the existence of a table or partition in the specified database.

The original function does not handle the case where the table or partition name is listed as part of another table or partition name.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to split the output of the `run_hive_cmd` command by newline and search for an exact match of the table or partition name.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(partition == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

This corrected version splits the stdout by newline and checks if any line exactly matches the table or partition name, addressing the issue of incorrect matches.
