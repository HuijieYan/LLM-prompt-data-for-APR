The buggy function has an issue in the conditional statements that check the presence of the table or partition. In the first case, it returns `False` when it should return `True` because 'mytable' is present in the `stdout`. In the second case, it returns `True` when it should return `False` because 'mytable' is not present in the `stdout`. The same issue applies to the third and fourth cases as well.

The main problem is in the `run_hive_cmd` function call, which is returning different values for the same input, leading to inconsistent results. Additionally, the method to check if a table or partition exists is not robust.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to use a better approach to check for the presence of the table or partition. We can modify the `run_hive_cmd` function to return more consistent and meaningful values for different input.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout has any content
        else:
            partitions = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(partitions)  # Check if partitions have any content
```

In this corrected version, we directly return the boolean value of whether `stdout` or `partitions` have any content. This approach should provide consistent results for checking the existence of tables or partitions.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
