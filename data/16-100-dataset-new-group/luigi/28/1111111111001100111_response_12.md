The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The current implementation does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to failing tests when the table name's case does not match the case of the table name in the output of the Hive command.

The bug occurs because the function directly compares the table name with the output from the Hive command without any case normalization. This causes the function to return incorrect results when the case of the table name is different from the case of the table name in the Hive command output.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command needs to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, both the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, allowing the function to return the correct results for table existence.
