Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The first branch of the conditional statement checks whether the variable `stdout` is truthy, which might lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The second branch of the conditional statement returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty and `False` otherwise, which is overly verbose and can be simplified.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `run_hive_cmd` function is supposed to return the output of a Hive command, but the function does not correctly check for the existence of a table in the output.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    return table in stdout
```
