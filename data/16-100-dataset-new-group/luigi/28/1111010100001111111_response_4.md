The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for the case sensitivity of table names when checking for their existence in the Hive database. This is highlighted in the GitHub issue, which suggests that stdout should be checked against table.lower() to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.lower().strip() != "FAILED"
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that case sensitivity is no longer an issue when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database.
