The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional checks for `stdout` in both the if-else blocks. The function is returning the opposite of what is expected if the condition is met. 

The cause of the bug is that in the `table_exists` function, the conditions are flipped for returning `True` and `False` based on the presence of `stdout`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the conditional checks to correctly return `True` when `stdout` is present and `False` when it is not.


Now, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # simplified condition to return True if stdout is present, False if it's not
```
