The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This bug causes tests to fail when checking for table existence with differently cased table names.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, as suggested in the GitHub issues. This will ensure that the function works correctly when checking for the existence of tables with different casing.
