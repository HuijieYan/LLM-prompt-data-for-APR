Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity. The function is not handling the case of the table name properly, resulting in failures for certain inputs.

To fix the bug, I would suggest modifying the comparison to make it case insensitive. We can convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # other functions declared in the class
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
