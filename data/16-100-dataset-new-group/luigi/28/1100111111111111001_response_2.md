The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle the case where the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function contains the table name as a separate word. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where we check for the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Instead of directly checking if the table name is in the output, we should split the output by newline characters and then check if the table name appears in any of the lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # other functions...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and checking if the table name is in any of the lines, we ensure that we handle cases where the table name appears as a separate word in the output.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
