def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. When checking for the existence of a table, the function does not consider the case of the table name, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, I modified the comparison to make it case-insensitive by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lower case before checking for the existence of the table within the output. This ensures that the function checks for the table's existence irrespective of the case.

The corrected version of the function satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
