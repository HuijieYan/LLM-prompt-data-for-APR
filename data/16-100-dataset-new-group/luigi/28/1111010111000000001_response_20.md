The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when no table exists or when no partition exists. The function returns `True` if there is any output from the command, even if the table or partition doesn't exist. It should actually return `False` in those cases.

The first potential error location is the conditional check for `stdout`. In the first `if` block, `stdout` is checked for `table in stdout`, and in the second block, it is checked for a Truthy value. This could lead to incorrect behavior when the table or partition does not exist.

The cause of the bug is that when the command is executed to check for the existence of a table or partition, the function does not correctly interpret the output to determine if the table or partition actually exists.

One strategy to fix the bug is to modify the conditional checks to verify the correct output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine the existence of the table or partition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(
                database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)
            )
        )
        
        return stdout.strip() != ''
```

By splitting the `stdout` on a newline character and checking for the existence of the table in the resulting list in the first block, and checking for a non-empty string in the second block, we can accurately determine if the table or partition exists. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
