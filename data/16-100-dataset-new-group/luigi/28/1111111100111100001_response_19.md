The issue in the `table_exists` function seems to be that it incorrectly checks for the presence of the table in the `stdout` when a partition is not specified. And when a partition is specified, it incorrectly constructs the Hive command to check for partition existence.

To fix this issue, we need to update the condition where a partition is not specified to correctly check for the presence of the table in the `stdout`. Additionally, when a partition is specified, we need to correctly construct the Hive command to check for the existence of the specified partition.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = " AND ".join([f"{key}='{value}'" for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_query})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle both cases with and without a partitions, and should pass the failing tests.
