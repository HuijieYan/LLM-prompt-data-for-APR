Taking all the information provided into consideration, it seems that the issue with the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is that the comparisons are case-sensitive. This is reflected in both the failing test cases and the GitHub issues that have been raised.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. Specifically, the `table` parameter should be converted to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By using the `lower()` method to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, the comparison becomes case-insensitive, thus resolving the issue. This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issues #896 and #895.
