The bug originates in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The bug is causing the failing of the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` test functions located in the `test/contrib/hive_test.py` file.

The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to how the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function is being handled when `partition` is None. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive query and expects to detect if a table exists based on the stdout response. However, it is failing to correctly identify if the table exists or not, which is causing the tests to fail.

The failing test function `test_table_exists` is using mock values for `run_hive_cmd`. An initial return value is set where the table does not exist, but the buggy function is incorrectly returning `True`. A subsequent return value is set where the table does exist, but the buggy function is incorrectly returning `False`. This mismatch between expected and actual return values causes the test to fail with an AssertionError.

To fix the bug, the stdout handling of the `run_hive_cmd` function when `partition` is None should be reviewed. The function should correctly interpret the stdout response to determine if the table exists or not, and return a boolean accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the function correctly checks the stdout response returned by `run_hive_cmd` and returns a boolean value based on whether the table exists or not. This revised logic should address the bug and ensure that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected, passing the failing test.
