The buggy function appears to have an issue with case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The GitHub issue suggests that the function should be modified to make the table_exists check case insensitive by comparing the table name with the stdout in lowercase.

The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes the test to fail when the table name is defined in capitalized letters, but Hive returns the table name in lowercase.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in lowercase with the stdout returned by the Hive database.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, when checking for the existence of a table, we convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method and then perform the comparison. This makes the check case insensitive and resolves the issue with table_exists function.
