The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for determining whether a table exists in a specified database, with an optional partition parameter. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of the table.

The potential error locations within the function are in the conditionals for checking the stdout of the `run_hive_cmd` function and in the parameters passed to the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the input parameters and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In particular, the conditional checks for the existence of the table based on the command output are not consistent with the actual output format.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditionals to correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and ensure that the parameters passed to the function are formatted correctly. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the table name is not found in the command output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_clause = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_clause))

        return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
``` 

In this corrected version, we lowercase both the table name and the command output to ensure a case-insensitive comparison. We also construct the partition clause for the command and handle the case where the table name is not found in the output.
