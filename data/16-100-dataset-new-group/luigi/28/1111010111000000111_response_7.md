The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it fails to perform a case-insensitive check when validating the existence of a table in the Hive database. This bug is evident from the failing test cases provided in the `hive_test.py` file, where the test expects case-insensitive behavior while checking for table existence.

The issue has been identified in the `GitHub` issue with the title "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The issue describes the need for the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check when verifying the existence of a table in the Hive database.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to perform case-insensitive checks. The correction can be made by converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the `table` and `stdout` values are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before performing the comparison. This modification ensures that the check for the existence of a table is case-insensitive, thereby fixing the bug and satisfying the requirements mentioned in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding case-insensitive table existence checks.
