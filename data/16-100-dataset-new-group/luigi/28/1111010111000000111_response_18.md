The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue on GitHub also confirms this, requesting for the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive.

In the buggy function `table_exists`, the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` is case sensitive. This causes the test cases to fail in situations where the table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison to be case insensitive, so that it matches the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method, and the comparison is done on the lowercase strings. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, and the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue.
