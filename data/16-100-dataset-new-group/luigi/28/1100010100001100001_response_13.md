The bug in the provided function is that it does not correctly handle the case where the table exists in the database. The function should return `True` when the table exists and `False` when it does not. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the conditions for returning `True` or `False` based on the `stdout` variable.

The cause of the bug is that the function returns `stdout` directly, which is a string value. The presence of the table in the output is not checked accurately.

To fix the bug, the function should parse the `stdout` to check for the existence of the table and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table  # Check if the table exists in the output and return True or False accordingly
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # Simply return whether stdout is empty or not to indicate if the table exists
```

In the corrected version, for the case where `partition` is `None`, the `stdout` is checked to see if it contains the table name, and the result is returned accordingly. For the case where `partition` is not `None`, we simply return whether `stdout` is empty or not to indicate if the table exists.
