The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that when the `partition` parameter is not None, the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with incorrect arguments. The correct way to call this function is to use the `self.partition_spec` method to get the partition specification and then pass it to `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for the `partition is None` case to correctly call `run_hive_cmd` and handle the case when partition is not None. Additionally, it seems that `self.partition_spec` method needs to be implemented correctly to generate the partition specification string.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec_string = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec_string))
            return bool(stdout)
```

Here, I have modified the `else` statement to first generate the `partition_spec_string` using the `self.partition_spec` method and then pass it to `run_hive_cmd` along with other necessary arguments.

Assuming `self.partition_spec` is implemented correctly, this should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
