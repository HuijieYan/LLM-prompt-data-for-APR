The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the handling of the `stdout` variable and its check for the existence of the table. The current implementation checks if the table name is present in the stdout string, but it does not properly handle cases where the table name might appear as part of other words. Additionally, there is a case insensitivity issue that is not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic for checking the existence of the table in the `stdout` string and also handle the case insensitivity issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):

        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            # Check if the table name is present in the stdout, case insensitively
            return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            # Check if the output contains the partition info
            return bool(stdout)
```

This updated version of the function properly handles the case insensitivity issue by converting both the table name and the entries in the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison. Additionally, it uses the `any` function to check for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` string.

With this corrected implementation, the failing tests should now pass.
