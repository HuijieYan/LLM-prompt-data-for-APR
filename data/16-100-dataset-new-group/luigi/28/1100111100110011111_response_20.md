The buggy function `table_exists` is failing and causing an assertion error during testing. The function is expected to check if a table exists in a given database, case insensitively. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output. The failing test cases indicate that the function does not handle case insensitivity correctly.

The bug in the function is caused by the fact that it does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name to the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The failing tests indicate that the function is not able to correctly identify the case-insensitive table names, leading to a false assertion error.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to modify the function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them for existence, which will ensure case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Convert both to lowercase for case insensitivity
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # No need to compare for True/False, can return the boolean value directly
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will be able to handle case insensitivity correctly. This will resolve the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub.
