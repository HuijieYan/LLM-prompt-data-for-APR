The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to determine if a table exists in a given database in Hive. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run the Hive command and check the output if the table exists or not.

The bug in the function lies in the `else` block, where it constructs the Hive command to show partitions. Specifically, in the line:
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
```
There is a formatting issue in the Hive command that is being passed to the `run_hive_cmd` function. This can potentially lead to incorrect Hive commands being executed.

To fix the bug, the Hive command string needs to be constructed correctly and passed to the `run_hive_cmd` function. It's important to ensure that the format of the Hive command is accurate and includes the proper use of database, table, and partitions.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} PARTITION ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_str))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected function, the Hive command string is constructed using proper formatting and the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct command based on whether partition exists or not. This ensures that the function returns the expected output for each case provided.
