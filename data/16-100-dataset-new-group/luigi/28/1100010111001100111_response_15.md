The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly. The function needs to check if the table name in the standard output is in lower case to resolve the issue with case sensitivity described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table name in lower case with the standard output in lower case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should now handle case insensitivity correctly and pass the failing test cases, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
