The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns the wrong values for both cases where `partition` is `None` and when it's not `None`.

In the first case (when `partition` is `None), the function returns False when `stdout` is truthy and the `table` is in `stdout`. This is incorrect because the condition should be reversed - the function should return True when `stdout` is truthy and the `table` is in `stdout`.

In the second case (when `partition` is not `None), the function always returns True because the `stdout` is being checked but it is not being compared with anything.  The code does not check whether the `partition` exists in the `stdout`, so it always returns True.

To fix the bug, we need to reverse the condition for the first case and add a condition to check whether the `partition` exists in the `stdout` for the second case.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout) and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_query))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
