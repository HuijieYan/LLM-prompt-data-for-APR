### Explanation
The bug is occurring because the `table_exists` function is case sensitive, while it should be case insensitive. The issue is confirmed by the failing test case and the GitHub issue posted by Lin, where it is mentioned that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, making it difficult for the test to pass.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name case insensitively with the tables present in the database.

### The corrected version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        
        return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function retrieves all the table names from the database and compares the input table name case insensitively with the names present in the database. If the table is found, it returns `True`, otherwise `False`.
