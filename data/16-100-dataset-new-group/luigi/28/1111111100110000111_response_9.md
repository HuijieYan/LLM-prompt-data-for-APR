The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The issue mentioned in the GitHub report suggests that tables defined with capitalization are returned as lower case by Hive, causing the check to fail.

The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function is not performing a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table. As a result, the test cases are failing due to case mismatches between the table name in the function call and the table name in the returned stdout.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the table names returned from the Hive database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the comparison of the table name and the table names returned from Hive uses the lower case versions of both strings to perform a case-insensitive check. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub report.
