The buggy function has a problem where it does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in a Hive database. This is highlighted in the GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?". The issue explains that tables in Hive can be defined with capitalized names, but Hive is case-insensitive and returns table names in lower case, leading to test failures. The suggested fix is to compare the table name in lowercase with the output from Hive.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive as shown in the corrected function, it ensures that the function will work as intended and pass the failing tests. This fix also aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".
