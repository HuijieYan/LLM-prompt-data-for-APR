To fix the bug, we need to make the table_exists function case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The issue posted on GitHub confirms that this is the desired behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Changed to case insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The fix ensures that the table name is converted to lowercase, and both the table name and the stdout are compared in lowercase, thus making the comparison case insensitive. This fixed version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
