The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be in the check for the presence of the table name in the output `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The current implementation checks if the table name is directly present in the output, which might lead to false positives for similar table names.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the presence of the table name in the `stdout` string. We can use a more robust approach to ensure that the table name is a standalone word in the output string.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and f" {table} " in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we're using the `in` keyword to check for the presence of the table name surrounded by spaces in the `stdout` string. This ensures that the table name is a standalone word and not part of a larger string, which was causing the false positives in the original implementation. This should fix the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
