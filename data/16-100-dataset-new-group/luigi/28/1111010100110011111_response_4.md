To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This issue has been raised on GitHub (Issue #896) and it has been identified that when checking for an existing table, the function fails because Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lower case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, by comparing the table name in lower case with the output from the Hive command also converted to lower case.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, I modified the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout from the Hive command to lower case before comparing them. This makes the comparison case insensitive and allows the function to correctly identify the table existence.

This correction will resolve the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it addresses the issue posted on GitHub by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
