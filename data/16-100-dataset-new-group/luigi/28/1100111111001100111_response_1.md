The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes the failing test cases, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

The bug is caused by the function not handling case insensitivity effectively. It currently uses a simple string comparison to check for the presence of the table in the output, which does not account for case differences between the table name and the output.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The updated code ensures that both the table name and the output are converted to lowercase before the comparison, resolving the case insensitivity issue pointed out in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
