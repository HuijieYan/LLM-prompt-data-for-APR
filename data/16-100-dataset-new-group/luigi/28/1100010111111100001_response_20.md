The issue with the `table_exists` function is that the conditions for checking if the table exists are not properly handled. Specifically, the function does not correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists or not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for obtaining and checking the `stdout` variable in both cases where the partition is `None` and where it is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}
                            partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, we are properly checking the presence of the table in the list obtained from `stdout` using `split()` when `partition` is `None`, and we are directly returning the boolean value of `stdout` when `partition` is not `None`.

This corrected version should resolve the issues encountered in the failing test cases.
