To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function so that it performs a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists in the Hive database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we use `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison, which addresses the issue brought up in the GitHub discussion.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the GitHub issue posted regarding the case insensitivity of table names in Hive.
