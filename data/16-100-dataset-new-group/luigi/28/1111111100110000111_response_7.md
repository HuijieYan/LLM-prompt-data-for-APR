The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the test cases to fail, as it is not handling table name case insensitivity properly. The issue #896 on GitHub highlights the problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive while checking for table existence.

The bug is at this specific line of code:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
This line does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table name and fails to return the correct result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by converting the table name to lowercase before checking its existence in the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for existence, we ensure that the check is case insensitive. This will fix the bug and allow the test cases to pass.
