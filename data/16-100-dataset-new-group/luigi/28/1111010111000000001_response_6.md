The buggy function `table_exists` has two potential error locations:

1. The condition for checking if the table exists or not:
   The function checks if the `stdout` is not empty instead of checking for specific table names when the `show tables` command or `show partitions` command is executed.

2. Incorrect formatting of the `show partitions` command:
   The formatting of the `show partitions` command is incorrect, and it does not properly handle the partition parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly interprets the output of the `show tables` command and the `show partitions` command, leading to incorrect determination of table existence.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly parse the output of the `show tables` or `show partitions` commands to determine if the specified table exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

            table_names = stdout.split('\n')

            return table in table_names
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- For the `show tables` command, the output is split by newline character and then checked for the presence of the specified table.
- For the `show partitions` command, the output is directly checked using a boolean condition, as it may contain partition information.

These changes should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
