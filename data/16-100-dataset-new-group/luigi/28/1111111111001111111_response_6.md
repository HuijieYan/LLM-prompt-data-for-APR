Taking into account the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case insensitivity correctly. The function should make a case-insensitive comparison to address the issue raised in the GitHub report.

To fix the bug:
- The `table_exists` function needs to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout from the hive command is case insensitive.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the case insensitivity issue by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub (#896).
