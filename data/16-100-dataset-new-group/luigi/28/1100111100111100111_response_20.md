The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the tests due to case sensitivity issues. The function compares the table names in a case-sensitive manner, causing the tests to fail when the case of the table names doesn't match exactly.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name directly to the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, without considering case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other functions ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `stdout` and `table` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This makes the comparison case-insensitive and resolves the failing tests.
