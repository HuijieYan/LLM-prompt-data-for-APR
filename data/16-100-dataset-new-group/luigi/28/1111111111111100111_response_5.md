The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases provided. The root cause of the bug seems to be that the comparison between the table name and the tables in Hive is case sensitive, as highlighted in the GitHub issues.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table names should be case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we store the tables from Hive in lowercase and compare the input table name in lowercase as well using list comprehension and the `any` function. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison.

This should fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function pass the failing tests and address the issues reported in GitHub.
