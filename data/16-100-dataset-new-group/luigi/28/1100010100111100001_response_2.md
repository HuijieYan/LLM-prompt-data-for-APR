The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how it handles the `stdout` variable and the condition for returning True or False. It appears that the function is not properly processing the stdout to determine if the table exists.

The `table_exists` function should return True if the table is found in the stdout, and False if it is not found.

The bug might be in the conditional statements that check the `stdout` variable and return values based on its existence. It seems that the function expects the table name to be in the stdout without any additional whitespaces or line breaks.

To fix the bug, the function should validate the content of the `stdout` variable more effectively and handle situations where the table name might be separated by line breaks or other whitespaces.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout.split()
```

In the corrected version, the `stdout` is split into a list of table names, and then the function checks if the given table exists in that list. This approach is more robust and should address the issue of the buggy function.
