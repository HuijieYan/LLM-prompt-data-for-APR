The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it does not handle the case insensitivity of Hive table names correctly. The expected behavior is to check if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner, i.e., irrespective of case differences in the table name.

The buggy function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to execute Hive commands and check the results. The bug arises from the comparison of the table name extracted from the command output and the provided table name. In the case of case-insensitive table names, this comparison leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the extracted table names from the command output and the provided table name to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected function:
1. The `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.
2. The `bool()` function is used to directly convert the `stdout` value to a boolean, as it is not necessary to explicitly check `if stdout: return True else: return False`.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case-insensitive table name comparisons and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
