The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is due to incorrect logic in the conditionals that check the existence of a table.

1. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect because the `stdout` should only be considered present if it contains the table name exactly. Instead, it is performing a substring search, causing a false positive when the table name is only a part of another table's name.

2. The conditional for when `partition` is not None is also incorrect. It does not properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and always returns True, regardless of the existence of the specified partition.

3. The error messages from the failing tests suggest that the function is not correctly identifying whether a table exists or not.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the function to properly check for the table's presence in the output of `run_hive_cmd` and handle the case when a partition is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
        return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly identify the existence of a table and handle the specified partitions, resolving the failing tests.
