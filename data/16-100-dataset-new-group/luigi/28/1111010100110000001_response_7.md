The buggy function `table_exists` has two different implementation paths: one for `if partition is None` and one for `else` condition. The buggy code is not correctly handling the case in which `stdout` returns an empty string and it directly uses the value to determine the existence of the table. As a result, the failing tests are asserting `False is not true`.

To fix this, both `stdout` conditions for an empty string should be handled properly with the correct `return` statements. In other words, we need to check if `stdout` is not an empty string before proceeding to the table existence checks.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

By handling the condition for an empty `stdout`, the corrected code ensures that the table existence checks are only performed when the `stdout` is not empty, which resolves the issue of returning incorrect assertions.
