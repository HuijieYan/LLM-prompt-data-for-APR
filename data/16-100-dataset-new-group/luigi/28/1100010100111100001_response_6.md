The bug in the given function is causing a failure in the tests for the `table_exists` method. The function is not correctly parsing the `stdout` response from the `run_hive_cmd` call.

The issue is that the function is checking if `stdout` has a non-empty value to determine if the table exists. This approach is incorrect in the case where the `stdout` could list multiple tables or partitions. The function needs to check if the exact table name is present in the `stdout` response.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the function to split the `stdout` response by newline and then check if the exact table name is present in the list of table names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_list = stdout.split('\n')
        if table in table_list:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` response and checking for the exact table name in the list, the corrected function should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
