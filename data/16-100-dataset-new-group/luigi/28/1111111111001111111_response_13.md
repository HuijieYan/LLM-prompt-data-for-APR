The buggy function is not case-insensitive, which is causing the failing test cases. The expectation is that the function should return true regardless of case. In the failing tests, when the table name is provided in a different case than the one in the stdout, the function incorrectly returns false.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function so that it does not consider the case of the table names when comparing with the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table = table.lower()  # Convert the table name to lowercase
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.lower()  # Check if the lowercase table name is in the lowercase stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that the table name provided to the function is converted to lowercase, and then it checks for its presence in the lowercase stdout output, making the comparison case-insensitive.

This change will make the function case-insensitive and resolve the failing test cases. It also satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the reported GitHub issue.
