The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the logic for checking the existence of a table, especially when a partition is provided. The failing tests highlight inconsistencies in the return values, indicating that the function is not correctly identifying the table existence in different scenarios.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the conditionals used to check the existence of the table with or without a partition. In the else branch, where a partition is provided, the logic for constructing the hive command and checking the output seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the constructed hive commands are correct, and the conditionals for checking the existence of the table are properly implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""
                use {0};
                show partitions {1} partition ({2});
            """.format(database, table, partition_str))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `table_exists` function constructs the hive command based on whether a partition is provided. For the case where a partition is provided, it constructs the partition filter string from the input partition dictionary and then constructs the hive command accordingly. The output of the hive command is then converted to a boolean value to determine the existence of the table.

This corrected version should address the issues identified in the failing tests and ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly identifies the existence of a table with or without a partition.
