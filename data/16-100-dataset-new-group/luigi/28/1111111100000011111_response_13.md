To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command. This will make the comparison case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will compare the lowercase table name with the lowercase output from the Hive command, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison. This aligns with the issue raised on GitHub and addresses the problem of failing tests due to case sensitivity.
