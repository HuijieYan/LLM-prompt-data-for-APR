The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity when checking for existing tables in Hive. The function is not considering case sensitivity, which leads to failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to ignore the case when comparing the table name with the result from Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions remain the same

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` is used to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

With this change, the failing test cases should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
