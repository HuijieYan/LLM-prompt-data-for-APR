Here's the corrected version of the buggy function. The potential error in the original code is the improper usage of the `partition_spec` function and the incorrect formatting of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def partition_spec(partition):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join("{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items())
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the original code, the `partition_spec` method was incorrectly called, and the formatting of the `run_hive_cmd` method was incorrect. The corrected code removes the unnecessary `partition_spec` method and modifies the `table_exists` method to properly format the partition information and call the `run_hive_cmd` method with the correct parameters. Additionally, the return statement is modified to return a boolean value directly based on the `stdout` variable.
