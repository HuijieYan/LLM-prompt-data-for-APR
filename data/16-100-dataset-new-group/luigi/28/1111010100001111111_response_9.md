Based on the runtime values and types and the expected values and types for each test case, it is clear that the bug occurs when checking for the existence of a table. The bug lies in the fact that the comparison is case sensitive, causing the tests to fail when the table casing does not match the stdout casing.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to convert both the table and stdout to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the case insensitive comparison will ensure that the tests pass regardless of the casing of the table names. This fix satisfies the expected input/output values and addresses the issue posted on GitHub.
