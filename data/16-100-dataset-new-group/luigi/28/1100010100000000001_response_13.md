The potential errors in the buggy function include the following:
1. Incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Missing formatting for the second query when `partition` is not None.
3. Incorrect condition checking for the `stdout` variable.

The cause of the bug in the function is primarily due to the incorrect usage of string formatting and if condition. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not defined in the provided code, so it is assumed to be an external function. The function checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database, but the logic for checking the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the formatting of the Hive commands is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `subprocess` module to execute Hive commands and capture their output. Additionally, we need to ensure that the Hive commands are formatted correctly with the appropriate placeholders and values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import subprocess

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        cmd = 'hive -e "use {}; show tables like \'{}\';"'.format(database, table)
        stdout = subprocess.getoutput(cmd)

        return table in stdout
    else:
        cmd = 'hive -e "use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});"'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = subprocess.getoutput(cmd)

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `subprocess.getoutput` function to execute the Hive commands. The commands are formatted with placeholders and values using string formatting. We check the existence of the table/partitions using the captured `stdout` and return the appropriate boolean value based on the presence of the output. Additionally, we use the `bool` function to convert the `stdout` to a boolean value directly.
