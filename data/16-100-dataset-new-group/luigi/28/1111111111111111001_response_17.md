The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing tests. The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function is not correctly handling the case where a table exists with a given partition.

The bug occurs in the `else` block of the `table_exists` function, where the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with a formatted string. The function should check if the output of the command contains any partitions, and return `True` if it does, and `False` if it doesn't. However, the buggy function is not correctly handling this logic.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `else` block of the `table_exists` function to properly check if the output contains any partitions, and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_cmd))

        return bool(stdout)  # convert the output to boolean value
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle the case where a table exists with a given partition, and the failing tests should pass.
