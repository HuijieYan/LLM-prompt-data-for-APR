The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how it handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the conditional statements that follow. The function checks whether a table exists in a specified database and returns a boolean value based on the result.

It seems the issue is with the conditional logic of the function. When checking for the existence of a table without a partition, the function compares the table name to the entire result of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which may include additional information. When checking for a partitioned table, the function is not properly constructing the command to check for the existence of the partition.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional statements to handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function more appropriately and to construct the command for checking the existence of a partitioned table correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table, table))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we modify the command to check for the existence of a table without a partition using 'show tables in {database} like "{table}"' and split the stdout of the command to find the table. For partitioned tables, we construct the partition string and use it in the command to check for the existence of the partition.

By making these modifications, the function should now pass the failing tests.
