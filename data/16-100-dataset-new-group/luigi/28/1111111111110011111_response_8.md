The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it fails to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. This is in violation of the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issues #896 and #897. The error messages show that the failing test results from the function not handling case insensitivity correctly.

To correct this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly check for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner.
