Based on the failing test cases, runtime input/output values, and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case differences when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. It only checks if the table name is present in `stdout` as is, without considering the case. This causes the function to fail when the table names are provided in different case formats.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure case insensitivity when checking for the existence of the table in Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the table existence check is case insensitive.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
