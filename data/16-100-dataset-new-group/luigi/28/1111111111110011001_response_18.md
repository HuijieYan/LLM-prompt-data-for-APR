The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic for checking the presence of a table in a database with or without a partition. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being used to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output, but the condition checks in the `table_exists` function are incorrect, leading to the failing test cases.

The bug appears to be related to the handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` and the condition checks in the if-else blocks.

To fix the bug, the logic of the if-else blocks should be modified to correctly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and successfully determine the existence of a table with or without a partition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_string = ",".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_string))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- For the case where `partition is None`, the function checks if the table name is present in the stdout and returns the result.
- For the case where `partition` is not None, the function constructs the partition specification string and uses it in the `run_hive_cmd` to check for the presence of the partition, returning `True` if the stdout is not empty.

This revised logic should rectify the issue and pass the failing test cases.
