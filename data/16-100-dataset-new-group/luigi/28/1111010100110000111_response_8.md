Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the table name in `stdout` with the actual table name without ignoring case sensitivity.
2. The handling of partition information in the `stdout` variable.

Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not account for case insensitivity in the comparison of the table name in `stdout` with the actual table name. This results in failing tests where differing case of the table name causes the comparison to fail.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive.

Given the information above, here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the table name and `stdout` are both converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` string method to make the comparison case insensitive. This will ensure that the function works correctly and passes the failing tests reported in the GitHub issues.
