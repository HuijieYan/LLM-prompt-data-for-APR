The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the tables returned in the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Since the issue has been identified and discussed on GitHub, the suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the input table name and the tables returned in the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(tbl.lower() == table.lower() for tbl in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive comparison between the input table name and the tables returned in the stdout, addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
