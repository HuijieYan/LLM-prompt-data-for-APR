The buggy function `table_exists` seems to be returning the incorrect value, which is causing the failing test. 

The issue is likely due to the check within the `table_exists` function. The function first attempts to run a command using `run_hive_cmd` to check if a table exists, and then depending on a partition condition, it again runs a command to check if a table exists. 

It is likely that the second check for the partition condition is not being handled correctly, which leads to the overall incorrect result.

To fix this bug, I suggest adding a condition to correctly handle the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function based on the partition condition. Additionally, some conditional checks based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function for the table name should be implemented to ensure the correct value is returned.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition))
    
            if stdout and table in stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function includes conditional checks based on the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function to ensure that the correct value is returned based on the table existence and partition conditions. This should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
