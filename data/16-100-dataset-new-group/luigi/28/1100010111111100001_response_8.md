In the buggy function `table_exists`, there are a few issues that need to be addressed. 

1. The first issue is with the condition checking in the `if` statement. In the case where `partition` is `None`, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` should be modified to `stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')` to check if the table exists within the list of tables returned by the `show tables` command.

2. In the case where `partition` is not `None`, the logic for checking the existence of the partition is incorrect. The function should be modified to use the appropriate `show partitions` command and check if the specified partition exists.

3. The `stdout` variable should be split into a list based on the newline character to enable proper comparison with the expected table or partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables'.format(database)).split('\n')
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).split('\n')
        return any(partition in part for part in stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
