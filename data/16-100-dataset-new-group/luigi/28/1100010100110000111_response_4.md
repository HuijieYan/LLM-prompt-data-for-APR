The buggy function `table_exists` from `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is causing tests to fail due to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue has been reported on GitHub and is related to tables with different capitalization causing tests to fail.

The bug is caused by the function not accounting for case insensitivity in Hive when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercased table name with the lowercased output from Hive to ensure case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will compare lowercased versions of the table and the stdout to ensure case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the failing tests and address the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
