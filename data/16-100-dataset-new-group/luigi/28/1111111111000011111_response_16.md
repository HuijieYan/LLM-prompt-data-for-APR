Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue. The function is not correctly handling case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not returning the correct results when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to handle case sensitivity by converting both the table name and the stdout from Hive to lowercase for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` variables are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison to ensure case insensitivity.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the case sensitivity issue and make the `table_exists` function pass all the failing test cases, as well as satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it addresses the GitHub issues related to the case insensitivity problem.
