Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name to the output from the Hive command. The GitHub issue also confirms this and suggests that the comparison should be made case insensitive.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function so that it compares the lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout. This will ensure that case sensitivity does not cause the function to fail.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue. It ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
