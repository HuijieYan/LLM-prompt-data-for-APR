The buggy function `table_exists` contains errors that need to be fixed. The function checks if a table exists in a database and returns a boolean value. The bug seems to be in the conditional statements that check for the presence of the table.

The bug is caused by the way the function checks the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and processes the results to determine if the table exists. In the first case, the function expects the stdout to contain the table name, and in the second case, it only checks if `stdout` is not empty.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to modify the conditional statements to accurately assess whether the table exists. For the first case, check if the table name is in the stdout, and for the second case, check if the stdout is not empty.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
