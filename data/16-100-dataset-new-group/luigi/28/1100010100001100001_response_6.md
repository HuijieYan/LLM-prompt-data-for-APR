The bug in the provided function seems to be related to how it handles the stdout variable and checks for the existence of a table or partition. The function seems to be returning the opposite of what it should, as it returns True when it should return False and vice versa.

The potential error locations are the conditional statements that check the value of stdout and the return statements based on those checks.

The cause of the bug is that the function is returning the opposite boolean value of what it should based on the presence of the table or partition in the stdout string.

To fix the bug, you can simply return the result of the conditions directly, negating the need for the if-else statements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
