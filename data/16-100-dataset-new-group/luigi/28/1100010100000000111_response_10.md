# The buggy function is the table_exists function in the luigi/contrib/hive.py file.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function is case sensitive, which causes the test to fail when the table name is in a different case.

Cause of the bug:
The bug causes the table_exists function to fail when the table name is defined in a different case than what is returned by Hive, leading to incorrect results.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison of the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to be case insensitive.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
