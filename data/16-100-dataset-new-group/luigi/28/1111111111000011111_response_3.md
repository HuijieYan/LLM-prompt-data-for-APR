The potential errors in the buggy function are related to the comparison of the table name and the output from the "show tables" and "show partitions" commands. The comparison should be made case insensitive.

The bug causes the `table_exists` function to return incorrect results when the table name and the output from the Hive commands are in different cases. This behavior is not consistent with Hive's case insensitivity for table names.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from the Hive commands. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue posted on GitHub regarding the case insensitivity of table existence checks in Hive.
