The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the fact that the table name is not being converted to lowercase before checking if it exists in the `stdout`. This is related to the GitHub issue #896, which discusses making `table_exists` case insensitive. The expected behavior is for the function to return true if the table exists, regardless of the case of the table name.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the `stdout`. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the function behaves as expected.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, the function will now correctly check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner and pass the failing test cases.
