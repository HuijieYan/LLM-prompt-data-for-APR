The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to correctly determine if a table exists in the database. The issue appears to be related to case sensitivity, as Hive is case insensitive and may return table names in lowercase, causing the function to return incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the function needs to compare the table name in lowercase with the content of `stdout`, also converted to lowercase. This way, it will correctly handle case sensitivity and accurately determine if a table exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub. It ensures that both the table name and the output from the Hive command are compared in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the bug and the GitHub issue.
