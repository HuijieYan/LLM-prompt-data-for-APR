The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has a couple of potential error locations. 

The first potential error is in the `else` branch of the function. It currently returns `True` if `stdout` has any value and `False` if `stdout` is empty. This might not be the expected behavior and could lead to incorrect results.

The second potential error is in the call to `run_hive_cmd` within the `else` branch. The query being executed seems to be incorrect and does not match the intended logic.

The cause of the bug is primarily the incorrect query being run in the `else` branch, leading to incorrect results in cases where `partition` is not None.

To fix the bug, we should update the second part of the `if-else` condition to correctly check for the existence of the partition when it is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Check for the existence of the partition
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Use bool() to convert any non-empty stdout into True
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly identify table and partition existence and pass the failing test.
