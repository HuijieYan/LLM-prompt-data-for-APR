The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the function handles the `stdout` variable. In the first case, the function should be returning False because `mytable` is not in the `stdout`, but it returns True. In the second case, the function should return True because `mytable` is in the `stdout`, but it returns False.

The cause of the bug is that the function checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` by using `table in stdout`, but this check is not case-insensitive and may produce unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the `stdout`. We can convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    stdout = ""
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

This updated function converts both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and should fix the bug.
