To fix the bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to make it case-insensitive. This means comparing the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table and the stdout to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and also pass the failing test cases provided.
