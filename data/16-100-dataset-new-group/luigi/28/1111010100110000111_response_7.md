The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is causing the test cases to fail due to a case sensitivity issue. The function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of the table.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name directly with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name case does not match exactly with the case of the table name in the output.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()` method.

This fix addresses the case sensitivity issue and resolves the failing test cases as well as the reported GitHub issues.
