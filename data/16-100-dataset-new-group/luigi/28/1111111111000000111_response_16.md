Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity. This can be fixed by comparing the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This modification compares the lowercase version of the `table` with the lowercase version of the `stdout`, making the comparison case insensitive.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
