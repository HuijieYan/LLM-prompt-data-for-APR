The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the condition checking for the existence of the table.

In the first part of the function, the code checks if `partition` is None. If it is, it runs a hive command to check if the table exists in the specified database. If the table is found, the function returns `True`. However, the bug seems to be in the condition for checking if the table is found in the stdout.

In the second part of the function, when `partition` is not None, the function runs a hive command to show the partitions for the specified table. If the stdout is not empty, it returns `True`. However, the bug seems to be in the condition for checking if the stdout is not empty.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug is related to the condition checks in both parts of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition checks in both parts of the function to properly handle the case where the table/partition exists in the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return len(stdout) > 0
```

In this corrected version, we split the stdout by newline character and check if the table exists in the list of tables in stdout. For the case with partitions, we simply check if the length of stdout is greater than 0 to see if the partition exists.

This corrected version should fix the bug and satisfy all the provided test cases.
