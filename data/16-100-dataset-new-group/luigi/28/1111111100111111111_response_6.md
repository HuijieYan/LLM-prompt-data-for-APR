The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not account for case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This leads to assertions failing when checking for table existence in both uppercase and lowercase variations.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase and then check if it exists in the lowercase version of the stdout obtained from the Hive database.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version checks for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This approach aligns with the discussion in the GitHub issue and addresses the bug with case insensitivity.

The corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
