The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function returns the opposite boolean value of what is expected. This is evident from the error message for the failing test, which shows that the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)` is failing because `False` is not `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to reverse the conditions in the `table_exists` function so that it returns the correct boolean value for whether the table exists or not.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Return the boolean value directly
```

In this corrected version, the double-negative return statements are removed. The condition `if stdout:` is already evaluating the truthiness of `stdout`, so returning `True` if `stdout` exists, and returning `False` if it does not exist, will fix the bug.
