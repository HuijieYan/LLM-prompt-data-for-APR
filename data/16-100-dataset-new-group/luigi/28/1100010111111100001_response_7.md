The issue with the current buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case where the table name does not exactly match the output from the `show tables` or `show partitions` commands. 

The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table, leading to failing test cases and assertion errors.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from the `show tables` or `show partitions` commands.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in tables]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                         ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n')]
```

With this correction, the function should now handle case-insensitive table name comparisons, effectively passing the failing test cases.
