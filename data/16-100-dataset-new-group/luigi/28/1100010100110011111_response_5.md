The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the table_exists function not handling case sensitivity correctly. The function checks if the table name exists in the stdout returned from the hive command. However, this comparison is case-sensitive, resulting in test failures when checking for tables with different casing.

The strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the comparison to be case insensitive.
2. Use the lower() method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

The corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case insensitive.

With this correction, the function should pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in table_exists.
