**Analysis:**
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug that causes it to fail when checking for the existence of a table due to case sensitivity.

**Potential Error Location:**
The bug is likely to be in the comparison between the table name and the table names fetched from the Hive CLI, specifically in the line `return stdout and table in stdout` or `return stdout and table in stdout.lower()`.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive CLI. The function does not account for case differences between the input table name and the actual table names fetched from Hive, causing the function to return incorrect results.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive CLI needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)  # No need for an additional if-else
    
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for the table existence in the Hive database. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
