After analyzing the provided information, it is clear that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database. The bug specifically arises when checking for tables that are defined as capitalized, leading to a mismatch between the provided table name and the case of the table name returned by Hive.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to make the comparison case insensitive, by converting both the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
