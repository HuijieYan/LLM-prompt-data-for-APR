The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the `run_hive_cmd` function calls, with incorrect processing of the `stdout`.

The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable after the `run_hive_cmd` call. In the case when `partition` is not None, the `stdout` variable does not correctly handle the multiline response of the `run_hive_cmd` call. This leads to the incorrect comparison and the buggy behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the multiline `stdout` and compare it to the expected value based on the test cases provided.

A corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = '/'.join([f'{k}={v}' for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})')
            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected function properly handles the `stdout` after the `run_hive_cmd` calls and compares it to the expected values based on the test cases provided. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass all the failing tests.
