Based on the error message, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function should be case-insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from Hive.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert the table name to lowercase and compare it with the lowercase version of the output from Hive. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the table and stdout are converted to lowercase before the comparison to ensure a case-insensitive check.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.
