The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it compares the table name directly with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, without considering case sensitivity. This causes the mismatch in test outputs, leading to test failures. The bug is related to GitHub Issue #896, where it is mentioned that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the `run_hive_cmd` output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version converts both the table name and the `run_hive_cmd` output to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the bug and accurately satisfying the expected input/output values.
