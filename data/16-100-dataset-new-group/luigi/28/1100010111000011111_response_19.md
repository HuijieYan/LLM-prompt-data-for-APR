The buggy function has an issue with case sensitivity when checking for table existence in a Hive database. The failing test cases show that the function does not handle case insensitivity correctly. The GitHub issue confirms that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for existence. This will ensure that case differences do not cause the function to return incorrect results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass all the failing test cases and also address the issue reported on GitHub regarding case insensitivity.
