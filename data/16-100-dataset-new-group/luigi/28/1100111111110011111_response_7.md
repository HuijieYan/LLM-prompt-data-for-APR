The bug in the `table_exists` function exists because the comparisons between the `table` and `stdout` are case-sensitive. This causes the tests to fail when the table names are not in the expected case. To fix this issue, the comparisons should be made case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this corrected version, the comparisons between `table` and `stdout` are made case-insensitive by converting them both to lowercase before checking for the presence of `table` in `stdout`. This change should resolve the failing tests and address the GitHub issues related to case insensitivity in `table_exists` function.
