The buggy function `table_exists` has a few issues that need to be fixed in order to satisfy the expected input/output values. The main problems are related to how the `stdout` variable is being handled and the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

The `run_hive_cmd` function is not defined in the given source code, so it's assumed to be a part of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The buggy function uses this function to execute Hive commands and capture the standard output. 

The buggy function first checks if `partition` is None and then uses the `run_hive_cmd` to execute a Hive command to check if the table exists in the given database. The function is then trying to return the result based on the value of `stdout`. However, this logic is incorrect because it doesn't handle the cases where `stdout` is not what's being checked.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the standard output captured from the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the correct value based on that.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return 'OK' in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and 'OK' in stdout
```

This corrected version properly checks if the table exists in the standard output returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function and returns a boolean value based on that.
