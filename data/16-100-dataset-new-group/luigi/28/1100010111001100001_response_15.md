The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be in the conditional check for the presence of the table or partition. In both cases, the function only returns `True` if the `stdout` variable is not empty. This is not correct behavior, as it does not correctly handle the case where the table or partition is not found.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function to return `True` only if the table or partition is found in the `stdout` output. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected version, the function directly returns the result of the conditional checks, eliminating the need for unnecessary if-else blocks.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing tests, as it now correctly handles the empty `stdout` case and only returns `True` when the table or partition is found.
