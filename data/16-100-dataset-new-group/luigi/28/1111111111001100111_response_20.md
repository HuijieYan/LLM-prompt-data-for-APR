Based on the analysis and GitHub issue, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not case insensitive when checking for table existence. This can cause the tests to fail when checking for tables with different case variations. The suggested fix in the GitHub issue is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Given this information, we can fix the bug by modifying the `table_exists` function to perform a case insensitive comparison when checking for table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the function now converts both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison to check for table existence. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the bug and enabling the function to pass the failing test.
