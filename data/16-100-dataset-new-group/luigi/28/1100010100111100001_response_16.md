The bug seems to be related to the way the function is handling the stdout variable when checking for the existence of a table or a partition in the Hive database.

The actual bug seems to be related to how the function reads the values of stdout and determines whether the table or partition exists. In the failing tests, it looks like the function is returning the opposite of what is expected.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic inside the function to properly handle the values of stdout and return the correct boolean result based on whether the table or partition exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the function handles the stdout values correctly, returning True if the table or partition exists, and False if it doesn't, based on the values of stdout. This should fix the bug and make the failing tests pass.
