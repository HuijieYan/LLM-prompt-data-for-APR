The bug in the function "table_exists" is that it always returns the opposite boolean value of what is expected. The function returns True when it should return False, and vice versa. This is due to the incorrect logic in the if-else statements in the function.

The first if-else statement checks if the partition is None, and if so, it checks if the table exists in the database. If the table exists, it should return True, but currently, it returns the result of the expression `stdout and table in stdout`, which causes it to return the opposite value.

The second if-else statement checks if there is a partition, and if so, it constructs a command to check for the existence of the table with the given partition. However, the return value should be based on whether the stdout contains any partitions, but the function currently returns the opposite value.

To fix the bug:
1. For the first if-else statement, change the return statement to `return table in stdout` to ensure the correct boolean value is returned.
2. For the second if-else statement, change the logic to check if stdout is not empty, and return True if it is not empty, and False if it is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function "table_exists":

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```

With this correction, the function should return the correct boolean values and pass the failing test cases.
