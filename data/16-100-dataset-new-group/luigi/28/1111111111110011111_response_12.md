The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive when comparing the table name retrieved from the Hive command output with the input table name. This causes the function to fail when the table names have different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name input and the table name retrieved from the Hive command output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With the corrected function, the issue posted on GitHub will be resolved, and the `table_exists` function will correctly handle case insensitivity when comparing table names. This will ensure that all the failing test cases will pass as expected.
