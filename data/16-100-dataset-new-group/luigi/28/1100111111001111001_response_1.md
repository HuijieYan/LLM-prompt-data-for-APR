The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly checks the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists. In the first condition, it checks if `stdout` has any value, and in the second condition, it checks if `stdout` has a truthy value. The correct approach should be to check if the table name is present in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `if` conditions to check if the table name is present in the output, and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
