The bug in the provided function, `table_exists`, is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is potentially returning True when it shouldn't be. This is likely due to incorrect string comparisons or the presence of newlines in the `stdout` variable.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to add a condition to check for the exact match of the table name in the `stdout` variable, eliminating any possible issues with newlines or other unexpected characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... Other functions from the same class

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table == stdout.strip()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we added `.strip()` to `stdout` in the comparison to ensure there are no leading or trailing whitespace characters. Additionally, we simplified the condition to return `bool(stdout)`, as it already represents the truthiness of the response from `run_hive_cmd`.
