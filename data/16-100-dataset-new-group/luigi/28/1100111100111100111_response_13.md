The cause of the bug is that the table name comparison in the `table_exists` function is case sensitive, causing the tests to fail when the case of the table name doesn't match the stdout. This was reported as GitHub Issue #896 and there is a proposed fix to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive, resolving the failing test cases and addressing the GitHub issues.
