## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with related functions

The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class and calls the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions from the same file but different classes.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations within the `table_exists` function are:
1. Incorrect use of string formatting within the `run_hive_cmd` call for the SQL query.
2. The `partition_spec` call within the SQL query might not be functioning as intended.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the related functions

The bug might be caused by:
1. Incorrect usage of string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` call, which might result in an invalid SQL syntax.
2. The reference to `self.partition_spec(partition)` within the SQL query might not be retrieving the expected partition specification.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

1. Use correct string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` call to ensure the SQL query is formatted properly.
2. Verify the `partition_spec` implementation to ensure it returns the expected partition specification.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_clause = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_clause))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. The string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` call for the SQL query has been fixed to use correct formatting.
2. The `partition_spec` call within the SQL query has been extracted to a variable `partition_clause` before calling `run_hive_cmd`.

This should address the potential errors and provide a corrected version of the function.
