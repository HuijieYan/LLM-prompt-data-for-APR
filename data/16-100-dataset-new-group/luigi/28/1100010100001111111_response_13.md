The buggy function `table_exists` is a method that checks if a given table exists in a specified database. The issue with the function is that it is case-sensitive, and the GitHub issue suggests that table names might be returned in lowercase by Hive, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive check by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the function now converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase and checks for the existence of the table in the converted stdout. This approach addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function behaves as expected.
