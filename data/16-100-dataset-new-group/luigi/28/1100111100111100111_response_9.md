The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity. The function is failing the test cases for table names that have different case letters. The issue was reported in GitHub and there was a suggested fix to make `table_exists` case insensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function directly to the table name without considering the case of the letters. This causes the test to fail when the case of the table name and the returned output from `run_hive_cmd` are different.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This will make the comparison case insensitive and the function will return the correct result for table existence check.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                  (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function uses the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, making the comparison case insensitive. This fix will resolve the failing tests and address the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity.
