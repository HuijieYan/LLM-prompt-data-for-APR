The bug in the provided function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being properly called to execute the Hive command and capture the stdout. Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of a table or a partition is not correct.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct Hive command, and the output is captured and processed properly. Also, we need to fix the logic for checking the existence of the table and the partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In this corrected version, we have fixed the Hive command to properly check the existence of the table or partition. We also use the `strip` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces in the stdout. The logic for checking the existence of the table or partition is also fixed to return the expected boolean value.

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values and types provided for the buggy function.
