### Potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The comparison of `table in stdout` may be causing the issue, especially if the table name case is sensitive.
2. Similarly, the comparison of `stdout` with the expected value in the else block may also be causing the issue.

### Explanation of the bug:

The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in table names. The issue in GitHub also mentions that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lower case. This causes the comparison in the `table_exists` function to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both `table` and `stdout` to the same case (either lower or upper case) before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, making the comparison case insensitive and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
