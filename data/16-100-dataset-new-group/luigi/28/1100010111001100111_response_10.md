The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function is not handling the case insensitivity correctly, causing the tests to fail.

The buggy function is failing the tests due to not handling case sensitivity. The first two test cases are failing because the function is not checking for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner. The third test case is failing due to the partition specification handling.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase or uppercase for comparison, thus making the check case-insensitive. Additionally, the partition functionality needs to be corrected in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, making the check case-insensitive. For the partition case, we simply return the boolean value of the `stdout`.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
