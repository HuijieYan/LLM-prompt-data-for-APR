This bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` file. The bug causes the function to fail when checking for the existence of a table due to case sensitivity issues. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the function is returning incorrect results when comparing table names.

The root cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function compares the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without converting them to the same case format. This causes the function to return incorrect results when trying to determine the existence of a table.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This change will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected `table_exists` function will be case insensitive and pass the failing tests.
