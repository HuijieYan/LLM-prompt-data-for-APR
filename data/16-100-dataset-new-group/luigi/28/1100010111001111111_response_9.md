The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The test cases and GitHub issue indicate that the function is failing to account for case-insensitive comparisons, leading to test failures. The expected behavior is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when comparing table names.

To resolve the bug, it's necessary to modify the `table_exists` function to perform case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence. This will involve changing the comparison logic for the `table` and `stdout` variables.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of `table` and `stdout` is performed in lowercase using the `lower()` function to make the check case insensitive.

This correction should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive in comparing table names.
