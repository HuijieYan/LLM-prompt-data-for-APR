The buggy function `table_exists` has several issues:
1. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect. It should return `True` only if both conditions are met.
2. The condition `if stdout:` and `else:` statements are unnecessary.
3. The string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` call is incorrect.

Based on the failing test cases and the expected input/output values, the corrected `table_exists` function should look like this:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() == 'OK'

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
