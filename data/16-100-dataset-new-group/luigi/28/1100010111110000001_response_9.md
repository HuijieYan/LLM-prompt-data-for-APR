Potential errors in the buggy function:
1. In the `else` part of the function, the `stdout` variable is assigned the output of a command that checks if partitions exist. However, the return logic does not properly handle the partition existence check.

Cause of the bug:
The issue is that the `else` part of the function does not return the output of the partition existence check properly. This causes the failing test case to produce the error message.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Provide a return statement based on the presence of the expected partition existence check result.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Ensure that the return value is based on the existence check
```
