The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing it to return incorrect results.

The issue seems to be with the way the partition is being handled in the else statement. The call to `run_hive_cmd` is not properly formatted, and it seems to be missing the actual partition value when `self.partition_spec(partition)` is called.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure the `run_hive_cmd` call within the else statement is formatted correctly with the partition information. Also, in the first conditional statement, it would be better to explicitly check if `stdout` is not empty instead of relying on the truthiness of the string.

Additionally, considering the variables are being used in shell commands, it's important to ensure they are formatted and escaped correctly to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
import shlex

# ... (other code)

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)
    
    # The corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_values = ' and '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            cmd = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_values)
            cmd = shlex.quote(cmd)  # Ensure correct shell escaping
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
            return bool(stdout)
```
In this corrected version, when a partition is provided, the `partition_values` are formatted and then included in the shell command. It is also ensured that the command is correctly escaped to prevent any shell injection vulnerabilities. The function explicitly checks if `stdout` is not empty before returning the result.
