The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a logic error in the conditional statements. On inspecting the code, it seems like there is a mismatch in the expected return value of the function and the actual return value when running the test cases.

The first issue is in this section of the code:
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
return stdout and table in stdout
```
In the conditional statement, `return stdout and table in stdout`, the logic to check if `table` exists in `stdout` is incorrect. The logical operation should be `table in stdout.split('\n')` instead, as the `stdout` may have multiple lines returned.

The second issue is in this section of the code:
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
if stdout:
    return True
else:
    return False
```
Here, the return value should be based on the condition `table in stdout.split('\n')` instead of simply returning `True` or `False`.

To fix the bug, the logical operations in the `if` conditions need to be updated to ensure the correct behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
```
In the corrected version, the return values are based on the corrected conditions, i.e., `table in stdout.split('\n')`. This should address the logical bugs and enable the function to return the correct results.
