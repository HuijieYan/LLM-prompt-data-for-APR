The problem in the given function is located in the `table_exists` function. The issue arises due to the incorrect logic for checking if the table exists or not. 

The cause of the bug is that in the `table_exists` function, it is returning the inverse result of what is expected. When the function checks if the table exists, in case the table exists, it should return `True`, but the function returns `False`, which causes the assertion error in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `table_exists` function needs to be updated to correctly return `True` when the table exists and `False` when the table does not exist. 

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # returning the boolean value directly

```

In the corrected version, the logic for returning the result is fixed to simply return `table in stdout` when the partition is None, and return the boolean value directly `bool(stdout)` when the partition is specified.

After applying these corrections, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases.
