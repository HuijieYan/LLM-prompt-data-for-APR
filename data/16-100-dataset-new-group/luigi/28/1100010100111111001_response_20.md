The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition to check if the `stdout` contains the table name is incorrect. It should be checking if the table name is present in the stdout, rather than just returning `stdout` as a boolean value.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `table_exists` function correctly checks if the table name is present in the `stdout` and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

This corrected function will pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
