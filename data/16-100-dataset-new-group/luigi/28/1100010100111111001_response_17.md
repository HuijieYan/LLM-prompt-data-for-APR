The buggy function is `table_exists`, which is meant to check if a table exists in a database. Based on the failing tests and the provided code, it seems that the bug is related to how the function handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

In the failing tests, the function is mocking the output of `run_hive_cmd` to simulate different scenarios. In the failing test cases, the mock output is 'OK' or 'OK\nmytable', but the function is not handling these outputs correctly.

The current code checks if the `stdout` variable is truthy and then checks if the table name is in the `stdout` string. This check is not sufficient, as it fails to handle the case where the table name is present in the `stdout` string but is not the only content.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` and accurately determine if the table exists based on the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split() if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` string into individual words and then checks if the table name is among those words. For the partitioned table case, it simply checks if `stdout` is truthy and returns a boolean value based on that. With these modifications, the function should now handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly and pass the failing tests.
