The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not handling the expected output from the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly. This causes the test cases to fail, as the function does not return the expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function in the `table_exists` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return bool(stdout) and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By using the `split()` function on the `stdout` string, we can check if the table exists in the output. Additionally, we can simplify the logic of the function by directly returning the boolean value of the `stdout`. This corrected implementation should now pass the failing test cases.
