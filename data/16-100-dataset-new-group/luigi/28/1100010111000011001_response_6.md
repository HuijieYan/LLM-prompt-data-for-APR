The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditions for returning True or False. In the first condition, the function checks if `stdout` has a value and if `table` is in `stdout`, while in the second condition it only checks if `stdout` exists. This is a logic error as the first condition should also check if the table is in the `stdout`. 

In addition, the function should handle the case when partition is None properly. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the first condition to check if `table` is in `stdout` in the if statement and properly handle the case when partition is None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
