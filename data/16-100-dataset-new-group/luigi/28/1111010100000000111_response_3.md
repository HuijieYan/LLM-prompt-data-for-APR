## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:

The buggy function "table_exists" is part of the "HiveCommandClient" class, which is used to find information using Hive invocations. The GitHub issue suggests that the table_exists function should be made case insensitive, as Hive is case insensitive and may return table names in lowercase, causing tests to fail when the table names are capitalized.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:

The potential error in the buggy function is that it does not account for the case sensitivity of table names when checking for table existence.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug:

The current implementation of the table_exists function does not consider the case sensitivity of table names returned by Hive. The function directly checks if the table is in the stdout, which may cause the test to fail if the case of the table name is different.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

The bug can be fixed by making the table_exists function case insensitive. This can be achieved by comparing the lowercase of the table name with the lowercase of the stdout when checking for table existence.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, I have modified the comparison to use the lowercase of both the table name and the stdout, making the comparison case insensitive.

This corrected version resolves the case sensitivity issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive.
