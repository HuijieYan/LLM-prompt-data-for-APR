The buggy function has an issue with case sensitivity when checking if the table exists in the database. This causes the failing tests and corresponding error messages.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing both the table name and the stdout in lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issues in the failing tests and the reported GitHub issues.
