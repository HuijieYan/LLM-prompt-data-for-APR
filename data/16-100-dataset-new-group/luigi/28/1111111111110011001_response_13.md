The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not properly extracting the table name from the `stdout` when a partition is specified. Additionally, the incorrect usage of the `stdout` variable is causing the function to return incorrect values, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function so that it correctly handles both the cases when a partition is specified and when it is not. We also need to ensure that the `stdout` variable is correctly used to extract the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            if isinstance(partition, dict):
                partition_str = ", ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
                hive_command = "use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})".format(database, table, partition_str)
            else:
                hive_command = "use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})".format(database, table, partition)

            stdout = run_hive_cmd(hive_command)
            return table in stdout.split("\n")
```

With this corrected function, we should be able to pass the failing test cases.
