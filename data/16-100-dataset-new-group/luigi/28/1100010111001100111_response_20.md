The buggy function `table_exists` fails to correctly identify if a table exists in the database, causing the tests to fail. The bug is causing the function to be case sensitive, while it should be case insensitive, as identified in the GitHub issues.

The main issue is that the function does not handle the case sensitivity of the table names in the Hive database properly.

To fix the bug, the function can be modified to convert both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive check.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function lowercase before comparison, the function now handles case sensitivity properly and should pass the failing tests. This fix aligns with the suggestions provided in the GitHub issues.
