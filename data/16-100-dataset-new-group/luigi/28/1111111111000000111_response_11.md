Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original `table_exists` function is caused by a case-sensitivity issue. The function does not account for the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. The failing test in the test cases provided points out this issue by testing for table existence using different cases of the table name.

The issue in GitHub (#896) also highlights the case sensitivity problem and suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

The solution is to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function has been updated to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method and then comparing them. This ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
