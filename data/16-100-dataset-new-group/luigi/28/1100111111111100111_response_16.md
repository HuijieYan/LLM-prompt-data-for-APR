The issue stems from the `table_exists` function not handling table name case insensitivity properly. The function only checks for an exact match in the stdout, which causes the failing test cases when the case of the table name doesn't match that of the stdout. The tests fail with the error "AssertionError: False is not true" when table names are not found in the stdout due to case mismatch.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should now handle case insensitivity for table names and pass the failing tests. This will also address the GitHub issues related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
