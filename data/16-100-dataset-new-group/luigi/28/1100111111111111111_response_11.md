The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. It should compare the table name with the names returned from the Hive database in a case-insensitive manner.

The buggy function `table_exists` is currently comparing the table name directly with the names returned from the Hive database. This causes the failing tests because the comparison is case-sensitive, and the names returned from the Hive database are in lowercase. 

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should lowercase both the table name and the names returned from the Hive database for a case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function will check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the failing tests and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
