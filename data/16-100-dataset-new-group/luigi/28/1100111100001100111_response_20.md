The bug in the given function is that it does not consider the case sensitivity of the table names. In Hive, table names are case insensitive, so the function should compare the table name in lowercase with the tables in the `stdout` to avoid case sensitivity issues.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison of table names in the `stdout` to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the tables in the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the function uses `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` for comparing table names, making the comparison case insensitive. This resolves the issue of case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table.
