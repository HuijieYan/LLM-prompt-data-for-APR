## Analysis
The `table_exists` function is designed to check whether a table exists in a given database. It takes in the parameters `table`, `database`, and an optional `partition`. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the `stdout` value returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.

In the failing tests, we see that the function is not returning the expected results for tables with different casing, i.e., "mytable" and "MyTable". This indicates a case-sensitivity issue in the comparison of table names.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the case-sensitivity of the `table in stdout` comparison. The current implementation checks if the table name is present in the stdout string without considering the case of the letters. This leads to failing assertions for tables with different casing.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the comparison of the table name in the stdout string should be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout string to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before performing the comparison.

## Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```
