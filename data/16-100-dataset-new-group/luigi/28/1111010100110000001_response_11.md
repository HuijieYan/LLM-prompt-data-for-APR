**Analysis:**

The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is expected to check if a given table exists in a specified database and return a boolean value accordingly. The function is using `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and parse its output.

The failing tests are checking the behavior of the `table_exists` method based on mocked return values of `run_hive_cmd`. The error messages indicate that the returned boolean values from the function are not the expected ones, leading to assertion errors.

**Identification of Potential Error Locations:**

1. The condition for checking if partition is None may not be handled properly.
2. String formatting and concatenation in the `run_hive_cmd` call.

**Cause of the Bug:**

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect parsing of the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd`. This means that the control structure within the `table_exists` function might not be processing the output correctly, leading to incorrect boolean returns.

The error occurs because the function does not return the expected boolean values, causing the test cases to fail.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

1. Verify the implementation of the condition checking if the partition is None.
2. Ensure proper string formatting and argument substitution in the `run_hive_cmd` calls.
3. Identify the expected output of the Hive commands to determine how to correctly interpret them.

**Corrected Version:**

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)  # Check for non-empty string
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)  # Check for non-empty string
```

In the corrected version, the string formatting and Hive commands are adjusted as per the expected syntax. The retrieved output from `run_hive_cmd` is used to evaluate a Boolean condition to check if the table exists or not. The `bool` function is used to convert the output to a boolean value.
