The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table. This has been identified as an issue on GitHub with the title "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".

The `table_exists` function only checks if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, without considering case sensitivity. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name is in a different case than what is returned by `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lower case before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will compare the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that the tests will pass.
