The issue here is that the table_exists function does not account for the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive database. The expected behavior for the function is to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if a table exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the table_exists function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue described in the GitHub report.
