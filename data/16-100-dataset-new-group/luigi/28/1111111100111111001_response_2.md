The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be related to the condition for checking if the table exists in the stdout. It seems that the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is not handling the case where the table is in the stdout but may not be the exact match due to case sensitivity. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check for the presence of the table in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By using the `any` function to iterate over the table names in `stdout` and checking for a case-insensitive match, we can ensure that the function works correctly and passes the provided failing test cases.
