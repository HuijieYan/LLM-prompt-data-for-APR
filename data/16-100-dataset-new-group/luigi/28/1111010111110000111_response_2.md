The function `table_exists` is expecting a table and an optional database and partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run a Hive query and check if the table/partition exists based on the output.

The potential error locations in the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect use of string formatting in the `if` and `else` blocks.
2. Incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. No case insensitivity check when comparing the table name.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. This leads to a failed test scenario when the table names are in different cases.

To resolve the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()
    cmd = f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";' if partition is None else f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})'
    stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
    
    if stdout:
        return table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        return False
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function will pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issues related to case insensitivity.
