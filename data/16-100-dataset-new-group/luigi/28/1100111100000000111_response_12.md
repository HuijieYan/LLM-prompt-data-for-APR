The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database, which causes issues when tables are defined in capitalized form and returned in lowercase.

Potential Error Locations:
- The comparison of the table name in `table_exists` function is case sensitive.
- The `run_hive_cmd` function is called with different queries in different parts of the function.

Cause of the Bug:
The `table_exists` function performs a case-sensitive comparison between the provided table name and the output from the Hive database, which may be in a different case. This results in false negatives when checking for table existence.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Convert the table name to lowercase in the `table_exists` function before comparing it with the Hive database output.
2. Adjust how the `run_hive_cmd` function is called to ensure consistent queries are used for table existence checks.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # Other functions...

    # Corrected table_exists function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_sql = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_sql))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
This corrected version of the `table_exists` function converts both the provided table name and the output from the Hive database to lowercase before comparing them. It also ensures consistent usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function with proper queries in both cases.
