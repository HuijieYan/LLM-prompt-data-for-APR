The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be the incorrect use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to check for the existence of tables in the specified database. The function is also falsely returning False when it should return True for certain cases.

Based on the failing test, it looks like the `run_hive_cmd` function is returning the expected output for each case, but the `table_exists` function is not handling the outputs correctly.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the appropriate boolean value based on the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly checks the existence of the table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and returns the appropriate boolean value. This should fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function pass the failing test cases.
