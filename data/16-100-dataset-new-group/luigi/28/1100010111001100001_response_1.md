The buggy function, `table_exists`, has a logical error in the second conditional clause. It does not correctly handle the case where the command does not return any output. This results in incorrect behavior when checking for table existence with or without a partition.

The buggy function fails the test cases because it is not correctly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, causing it to return incorrect results for table existence checks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function's second conditional statement to correctly handle the case where the `run_hive_cmd` function does not return any output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the second conditional statement has been simplified to just check the truthiness of the `stdout` value. This ensures that the function correctly handles both cases where the `run_hive_cmd` function returns output and when it does not.
