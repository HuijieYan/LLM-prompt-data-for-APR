## Correction

The issue with the buggy function is that it's not properly handling the `stdout` variable. The current implementation only checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty, but it should be checking whether the table name is present in the `stdout` for cases where the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the list of tables.

Instead of directly checking for the presence of `table` in `stdout`, we need to split the stdout and check each line for the exact match of the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` variable by newline character and then checks if the table name is present in the list of tables returned by `run_hive_cmd`. This ensures that it handles both cases where `run_hive_cmd` returns just "OK" or "OK\nmytable".

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
