The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity in the comparison of table names. The function currently does not handle case sensitivity and causes failing tests, as indicated by the GitHub issues #896 and the test cases provided.

The potential error location is the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` variable.

The cause of the bug lies in the comparison between the provided table name and the output of the Hive command. The function does not account for case sensitivity, leading to failing test cases where table names are not matched correctly due to case differences.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` variable should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` variable to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` variable to lowercase before comparison, the function now handles case sensitivity correctly, and the failing test cases should pass. This fix addresses the GitHub issue #896 as well.
