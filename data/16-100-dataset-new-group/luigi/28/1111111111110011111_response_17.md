The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The issue arises when the `table_exists` function compares the `table` with the `stdout`. The comparison should be case insensitive, as mentioned in the GitHub issue #896. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive. We can use the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will return the expected values and types for the given test cases and also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
