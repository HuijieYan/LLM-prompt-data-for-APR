To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the conditional logic in the function, which is currently leading to incorrect return values.

The bug is due to the way the function checks for the existence of the table and the partition. In particular, the logic for checking the partition is incorrect, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle the cases of checking for the existence of the table and the partition. We can use the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the appropriate hive commands for each case. Additionally, we need to update the conditional logic to correctly handle the different scenarios and return the appropriate boolean value based on the results of the hive commands.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_cmd))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
