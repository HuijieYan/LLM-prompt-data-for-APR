The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function checks for table existence without considering case sensitivity, causing the tests to fail. The GitHub issue #896 confirms this problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, resolving the failed tests and the GitHub issue.
