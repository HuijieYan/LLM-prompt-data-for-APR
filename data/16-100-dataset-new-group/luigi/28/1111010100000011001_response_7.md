The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. The potential error locations within the function are the conditional statements and the use of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are not correctly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists. It seems that the function is expecting a specific format of the output (`OK` or `OK\nmytable`) and then checking if the table exists based on that format.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditional statements to correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and determine if the table exists based on that information.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return self.partition_spec(partition) in partitions
```

In the corrected version, for the case where `partition` is None, the function retrieves a list of tables and checks if the specified table is in that list. For the case where `partition` is not None, the function retrieves a list of partitions for the specified table and checks if the given partition exists in that list.
