The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it does not take case insensitivity into account. The issue is that when checking for the existence of a table in Hive, the function does not consider the case of the table name, which leads to assertion errors in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase and then performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function now checks for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner, which will make it pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issues.
