The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being used, as well as incorrect formatting of the `stdout` value. The function seems to incorrectly check the presence of the table in the stdout output, which causes it to return incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called correctly and that the output is properly parsed to check for the existence of the table.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout.strip() == table
        else:
            partition_clause = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_clause))

            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

This corrected version accurately checks the existence of the table and its partitions by comparing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function with the expected values, and it handles both base table and partitioned table scenarios.

By modifying the function to properly compare the stdout output, we can ensure that the correct result is returned for both base and partitioned tables, and the failing test should pass.
