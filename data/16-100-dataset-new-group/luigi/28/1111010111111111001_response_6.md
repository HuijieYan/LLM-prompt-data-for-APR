The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be in the condition that checks the presence of the table in the Hive output. The bug seems to result from the incorrect comparison of the table name in the stdout.

The function checks for the presence of the table by comparing the table name directly with the stdout, without proper parsing or splitting of the stdout. This is leading to incorrect evaluations in certain cases, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should properly parse the stdout and then check for the existence of the table name within it. This would require splitting the stdout by newline characters and then checking for the presence of the table name within the resulting list.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the stdout is split by newline characters, and then the table name is checked within the resulting list. This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the presence of the table in the Hive output, resolving the bug that caused the test cases to fail.
