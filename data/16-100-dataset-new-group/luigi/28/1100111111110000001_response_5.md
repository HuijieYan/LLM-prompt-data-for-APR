The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test due to the incorrect implementation of the `table_exists` function.

The function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a specific database and partition based on the input parameters. However, the function is returning incorrect results, leading to failures in the test cases.

Upon analyzing the root cause of the bug, it is evident that the issue lies in the conditional check and the subsequent query executed when the `partition` parameter is not None.

The issue arises in the following section of the `table_exists` function:
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
```
The incorrect query construction for the `show partitions` command is leading to incorrect results, causing the subsequent conditional checks to fail.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should be updated to construct the correct query and handle the responses appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_condition = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_condition))
        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected function constructs the `show tables` and `show partitions` queries with the correct table and partition conditions. It also handles the responses and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the existence of the table and partition.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases.
