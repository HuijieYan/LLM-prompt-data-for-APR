The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the test to fail because the function is case sensitive and does not account for case differences in the table names. The bug is due to the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` without considering the case. This issue has been raised in GitHub's issue #896, suggesting that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function so that it compares the table names case insensitively.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, making the comparison case insensitive. This modification aligns with the solution proposed in GitHub issue #896.

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and address the issue raised in GitHub.
