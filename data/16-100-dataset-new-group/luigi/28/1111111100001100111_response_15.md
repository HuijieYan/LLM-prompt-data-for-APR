The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't consider case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes the function to return incorrect results, especially when the table names have different cases. The bug is related to the case insensitivity of Hive when returning table names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code inside the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before doing the comparison. This will ensure that case sensitivity is not an issue when checking for table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function will convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before doing the comparison, ensuring that case sensitivity is not an issue when checking for table existence. This fix addresses the GitHub issue and ensures that the function works as expected in all cases.
