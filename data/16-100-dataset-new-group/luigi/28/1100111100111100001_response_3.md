The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly checks whether the table name is in the returned string from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The buggy condition `stdout and table in stdout` will always be true if `stdout` is not an empty string, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should check for the exact occurrence of the table name in the `stdout` string, not just for its presence. We can use the `in` operator to match the exact table name.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This correction splits the `stdout` string into a list of table names and checks for the exact match of the table name, which should resolve the failing test cases.
