The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called without referencing it with the correct class. 

The function `run_hive_cmd` is defined outside of the class, so we need to import it and reference it properly within the `HiveCommandClient` class.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `run_hive_cmd` function and reference it using the class name. We also need to ensure that the `partition_spec` function is called in the correct way within the `table_exists` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd  # import the run_hive_cmd function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))  # call run_hive_cmd using self
            
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))  # call partition_spec using self

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, we have imported the `run_hive_cmd` function and referenced it as `self.run_hive_cmd` within the `table_exists` function. We have also called the `partition_spec` function using `self.partition_spec`. This ensures that these functions are called correctly within the `HiveCommandClient` class.
