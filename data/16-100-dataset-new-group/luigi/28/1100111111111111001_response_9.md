To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table_exists` function returns the correct values based on the provided input and expected output. The bug seems to stem from the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is called within the `table_exists` function. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in the way the `table_exists` function handles the presence of partitions.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # ...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec_string = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec_string})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

By updating the `table_exists` function as shown above, we ensure that it correctly handles both the presence and absence of partitions. This should address the failing cases observed during testing and satisfy the expected input/output values.
