The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` helper functions, which are not provided in the given code. It is likely that these functions are expected to retrieve relevant information from a Hive database, such as table names and partition information.

Based on the provided code and the input/output variable values, it seems that the function `table_exists` is intended to check if a given table exists in a specified database, and optionally, in a specified partition. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the partition parameter, as it does not use the `partition` argument to build the command when the table has a partition specified.

To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, a strategy would be to:

1. Complete the implementation of the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions.
2. Ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly interacts with the Hive database and retrieves relevant information based on the query provided to it.
3. Modify the conditional statement for handling the partition parameter in the `table_exists` function to correctly use the `partition` argument when building the command for the Hive database.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function based on the analysis and the suggested strategy:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions as before)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            # Assuming that partition_spec function correctly builds the partition specification
            partition_command = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_command))
            return bool(stdout)  # Returning boolean value based on whether stdout is non-empty
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function now includes proper handling of the partition parameter, using the `partition_spec` function to build the partition specification command and correctly interacting with the Hive database using the `run_hive_cmd` function.
