## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue
The buggy function table_exists in the HiveCommandClient class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The GitHub issue mentions that the function should be case insensitive, as Hive is case insensitive and may return table names in lowercase, causing the test to fail.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error location is in the comparison of table names in the stdout with the input table. The comparison is case-sensitive, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

## Explanation of the bug cause
The bug is caused by the function not being case insensitive when comparing the table name in the stdout with the input table name. This behavior is inconsistent with the case insensitivity of Hive, leading to incorrect results.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name in the stdout and the input table should be made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
In the corrected version, the table name in both the stdout and the input table is converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.
