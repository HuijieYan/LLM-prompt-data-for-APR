The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the test case to fail due to case sensitivity. The function currently checks if the table name is in the output string returned by `run_hive_cmd`. However, the comparison is case sensitive, and the failing test cases try to find tables with both lower case and upper case table names, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output string to lower case using the `lower()` method, and then checking if the table name is in the lower case output string.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the comparison between the table name and the output string will be case insensitive, and the failing test cases should pass.

By making this change, we address the issue reported in GitHub related to the case sensitivity of the `table_exists` function and provide a fix for it.
