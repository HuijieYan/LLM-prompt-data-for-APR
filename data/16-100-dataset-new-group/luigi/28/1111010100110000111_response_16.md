### Bug Fix Strategy
The issue appears to be related to the case sensitivity issue with the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The bug is causing the test cases to fail because the function does not handle case insensitivity correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to check the table name in a case-insensitive manner. The proposed fix involves converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the table name and the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, which addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function should now work correctly in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
