The issue with the buggy function `table_exists` is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the database. This causes the failing test cases where the table name is provided in different cases. The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` without considering case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the function needs to modify the comparison to be case insensitive, allowing it to match table names regardless of their case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using the `lower()` method on both `table` and `stdout`, the comparison is made case insensitive, enabling the function to work correctly as expected in the failing test cases.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it also resolves the GitHub issue posted about making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
