Based on the failing tests and expected inputs/outputs, it appears that the issue with `table_exists` is that it is case-sensitive and should be case-insensitive. Additionally, the problematic `run_hive_cmd` function returns the table names in lowercase, making the original function's logic incorrect.

To fix the bug, update the `table_exists` function to use case-insensitive comparisons by converting both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before checking for a match.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform case-insensitive comparisons and should pass the failing tests and address the issue posted in GitHub.
