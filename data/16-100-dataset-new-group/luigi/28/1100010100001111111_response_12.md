The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The GitHub issue also confirms this bug and suggests a fix to make `table_exists` case-insensitive.

The buggy function can be fixed by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This will ensure that case differences do not affect the result.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison, making the function case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue. This modification will resolve the bug and match the expected behavior.
