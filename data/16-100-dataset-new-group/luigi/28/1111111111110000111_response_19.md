The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class fails to perform case-insensitive comparison in the returned string from the `run_hive_cmd` function with the specified table name. This causes the test case to fail, as it expects case-insensitive comparison.

To fix this bug:
- Update the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison for the table name in the stdout returned from `run_hive_cmd`.
- Modify the condition to return True if the table name (in lowercase) is found in the lowercase stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function is now able to perform a case-insensitive comparison and will pass the failing test. This resolved the issue posted on GitHub related to making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
