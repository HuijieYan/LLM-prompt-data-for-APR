The bug in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it doesn't handle case insensitivity. The issue on GitHub suggests that this bug can be fixed by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, the bug is fixed and the function will now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
