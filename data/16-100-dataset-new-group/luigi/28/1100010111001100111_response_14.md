Based on the analyzed information, it appears that the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database. The failing test cases have indicated that the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should be updated to check the table names in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now handle case insensitivity correctly and pass the failing test cases. It also addresses the GitHub issues related to making `table_exists` case insensitive.

By making this change, the function will be consistent with Hive's case-insensitive behavior and ensure that table existence checks are performed accurately.
