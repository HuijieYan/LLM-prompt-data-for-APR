The potential error in the `table_exists` function is that the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is checking if `table` is in the stdout, which may not work correctly as the table name could be a substring of one of the other items in stdout. Additionally, the logic for the else condition is not well-defined and relies on the truthiness of `stdout`. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `table_exists` function to accurately determine if the table exists in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_clause = " and ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_clause))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the first condition checks if the table is in the list of tables (not as a substring). The second condition checks if the `stdout` is not empty to determine if the partition exists.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the provided failing tests.
