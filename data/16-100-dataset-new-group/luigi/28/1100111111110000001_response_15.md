The bug in the `table_exists` method appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of the conditional statements and incorrect comparison of the `stdout` variable.

The buggy function does not properly handle the case where `partition` is `None` and directly performs a boolean comparison on the `stdout` variable, which can cause unintended behavior. Additionally, in the case where `partition` is not `None`, the function incorrectly constructs the command to check for the existence of the table using `stdout` and a conditional statement.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to properly construct the commands to check for the existence of the table and handle the conditional branching based on the presence of the `partition`. Additionally, the comparison between `stdout` and the existence of the table should be handled more accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return bool(stdout.strip())
        else:
            partition_condition = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                   ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_condition))
    
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should work correctly and pass the failing test cases.
