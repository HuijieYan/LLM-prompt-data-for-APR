The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner. This is inconsistent with Hive's behavior, as it is case-insensitive. The GitHub issue clearly outlines this problem and suggests a solution to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to make the table name comparison case-insensitive using the `lower()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other class functions...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected `table_exists` function will accurately check for the existence of a table, regardless of the case of the table name. This resolves the issue posted on GitHub and ensures that the function behaves consistently with Hive's case-insensitive behavior.
