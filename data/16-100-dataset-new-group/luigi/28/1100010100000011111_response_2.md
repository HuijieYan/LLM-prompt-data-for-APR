# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The buggy function has been corrected to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lower case before comparing them. This change resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensures that table_exists is case-insensitive.

The key strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison condition to compare the lowercased table name with the lowercased output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This ensures that case differences between the table name and the output are ignored.

With the corrected function, the comparison is now case-insensitive, as required by the GitHub issue.
