The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns the wrong result when the `stdout` value is not empty. Instead of returning `True`, it returns `False`. This is likely due to the condition `if stdout:` in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check to ensure that the presence of any non-empty string in `stdout` results in a `True` return value.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # other functions from the same class...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout is not None and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout is not None
```

In this corrected version, we use `stdout is not None` instead of `if stdout:` to check whether `stdout` has any non-empty value. This change ensures that the function returns `True` when `stdout` contains any non-empty string, as expected in the test cases.
