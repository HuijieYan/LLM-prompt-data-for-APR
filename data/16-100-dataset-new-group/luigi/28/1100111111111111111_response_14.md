The bug in the `table_exists` function from the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is that it does not check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner. 

The failing test cases are expecting the function to return `True` when checking for a table that exists, regardless of its case. However, the function currently only checks for an exact match, leading to failures in case-insensitive scenarios.

To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, `stdout` and `table` are converted to lower case using the `lower()` method before comparison.

This fix should make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive and resolve the issue reported in GitHub (issues #896 and #1021). The corrected function is expected to pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
