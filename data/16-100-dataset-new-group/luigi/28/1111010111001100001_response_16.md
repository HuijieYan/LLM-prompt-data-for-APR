The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way the `stdout` value is being checked to determine the existence of the table or partition in the database.

Based on the failing test cases provided and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug is occurring when checking the `stdout` value for the presence of the table or partition.

The buggy function checks if `stdout` exists to determine the table or partition existence, but in some cases, it simply returns `stdout` without checking the existence of the table or partition within it.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the function to explicitly check for the existence of the table or partition within the `stdout` value, and return True or False accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # returning True if stdout is not empty
```

By explicitly checking for the existence of the table or partition within the `stdout` and returning True or False accordingly, the corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test.
