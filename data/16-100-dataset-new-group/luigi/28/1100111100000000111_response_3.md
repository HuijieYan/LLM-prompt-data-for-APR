The bug in the table_exists function is causing issues with case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The current implementation does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table names in the Hive database.

To fix this bug, we can modify the table_exists function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, we ensure that case sensitivity issues are handled when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post and makes the table_exists function case insensitive.
