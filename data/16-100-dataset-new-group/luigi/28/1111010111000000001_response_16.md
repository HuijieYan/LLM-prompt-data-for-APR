The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database. However, there are several issues with the function:

1. The first conditional block checks if the `partition` argument is `None`, but when it's not, it does not provide the correct logic to handle partitioned tables.

2. The second conditional block for handling partitioned tables uses the `run_hive_cmd` function incorrectly and lacks proper handling of the output.

3. The `run_hive_cmd` function itself is not shown in the provided code, so it's assumed that it interacts with Hive to execute Hive commands and return the output.

The test function `test_apacheclient_table_exists` checks the `table_exists` function by mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function to return different outputs and asserts the results. However, due to the issues in the `table_exists` function, the test cases may not provide accurate results.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to correctly handle the `partition` argument and properly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table or partition exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_condition = ' and '.join(["{}='{}'".format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        query = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_condition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `table_exists` function has been modified to generate the correct Hive commands based on whether the table is partitioned or not. It then correctly checks the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table or partition exists.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
