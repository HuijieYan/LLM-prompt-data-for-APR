The issue seems to be occurring when there is a mismatch in the table name case sensitivity. The function is not handling case sensitivity properly, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison operation in the function to be case insensitive by converting both the input table name and the table name from the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing both the table name and the stdout from the command in a case-insensitive manner, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
