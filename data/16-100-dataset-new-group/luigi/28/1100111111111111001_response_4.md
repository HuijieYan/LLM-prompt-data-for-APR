The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not correctly parsing the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking the existence of a table. It needs to handle the cases when the table does not exist and when it does, including when the table name is case-insensitive.

To fix the bug, we will update the `table_exists` function to properly handle the different possible outputs from the `run_hive_cmd` function. We will also make the table name case-insensitive when checking for its existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected output for all provided cases.
