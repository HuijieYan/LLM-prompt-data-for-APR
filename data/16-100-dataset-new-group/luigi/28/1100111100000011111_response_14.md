The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not case insensitive. The function compares the table name directly with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which may cause issues when the table names are in different cases.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version uses `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, and the function will work as expected in all cases mentioned in the expected values and types of variables. Additionally, this fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussion related to making `table_exists` case insensitive.
