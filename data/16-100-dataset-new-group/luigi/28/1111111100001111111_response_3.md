The bug in the function `table_exists` is that it does not handle case sensitivity. When checking for the existence of a table, the function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, which can cause issues if the case does not match.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and stdout should be case insensitive. We can modify the code to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function will compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from the Hive command, making the comparison case insensitive. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensures that the function handles different cases of table names correctly when checking for their existence.
