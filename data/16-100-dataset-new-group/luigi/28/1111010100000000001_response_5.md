The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements and the use of run_hive_cmd function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the partition parameter correctly, and the conditional statements are not evaluating the stdout properly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements to properly handle the stdout and partition parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we modified the conditional statements to properly handle the stdout and partition parameter. We also used formatting to construct the hive commands in a more readable way.
