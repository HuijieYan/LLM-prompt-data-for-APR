# The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            if isinstance(partition, dict):
                partition_string = '/'.join([f"{key}={value}" for key, value in partition.items()])
            else:
                partition_string = str(partition)

            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_string))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the table_exists function to compare the table name in lowercase to the output of the Hive command also in lowercase, we can make the comparison case-insensitive. This change addresses the issue reported in the GitHub issue #896.
