The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. This issue has been reported in GitHub and suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to convert the `stdout` and `table` to lowercase before comparing them.

Also, the `run_hive_cmd` function, which is used within the `table_exists` function, is assumed to be functioning correctly and returning the expected values. If there are issues with `run_hive_cmd`, they should be addressed separately.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both `stdout` and `table` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This change makes the comparison case-insensitive and will fix the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
