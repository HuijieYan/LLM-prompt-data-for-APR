The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of the Hive command. The problem is that the table name is not being converted to lowercase for comparison, causing the checks to fail when there are case differences.

To fix the bug, it should be ensured that the table name is converted to lowercase before comparison with the Hive command's output.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison, we ensure that case differences do not affect the result of the `table_exists` function. This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub and should make the function case insensitive as expected.
