The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when comparing the tables. This leads to failing test cases, as described in the GitHub issue #896. The function needs to be modified to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner and resolve the failing test cases and the issue posted in GitHub.
