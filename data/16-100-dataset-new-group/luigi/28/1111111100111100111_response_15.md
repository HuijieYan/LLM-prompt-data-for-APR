The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case sensitivity for the table name when checking for its existence in the Hive database. The code should be updated to ensure that it's case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to use case-insensitive comparison for the table name when checking its existence in the Hive database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function uses `lower()` to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase, enabling case-insensitive comparison. This modification addresses the issue described in the GitHub thread and should resolve the failing tests.
