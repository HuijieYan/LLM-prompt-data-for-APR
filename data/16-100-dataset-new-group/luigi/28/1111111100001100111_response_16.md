The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The issue on GitHub explains that the code is failing when a table with different capitalization is being checked for existence, as Hive treats table names as case-insensitive. The proposed solution is to convert the table name to lowercase before checking for its existence.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_spec_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the table name and the `stdout` value to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive. This modification addresses the GitHub issue and fixes the bug.
