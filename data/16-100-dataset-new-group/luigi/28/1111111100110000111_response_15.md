The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing tests and the issue in GitHub is related to making the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive.

The potential error locations within the buggy function `table_exists` are:
1. The comparison of the table names causing the test case sensitivity issue.
2. The handling of the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not handling the case sensitivity of the table names. When comparing the table names, it is not doing a case-insensitive comparison, causing the tests to fail when the table names are in different cases.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should handle the case sensitivity by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
  
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function compares the table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison. This change will enable the function to pass the failing test and resolve the case sensitivity issue reported in GitHub.
