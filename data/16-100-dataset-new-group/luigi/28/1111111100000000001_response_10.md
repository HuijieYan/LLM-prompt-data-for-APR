The potential error in the `table_exists` function lies in the call to `run_hive_cmd` and the formatting of the SQL queries. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without referencing it properly, assuming it is a method of the current class, which it is not. Additionally, the SQL queries are not being formatted correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to properly reference the `run_hive_cmd` function and fix the formatting of the SQL queries.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Other functions remain the same...

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the fixed function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table), check_return_code=True)
            return stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{0}="{1}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str), check_return_code=True)
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, I have properly referenced the `run_hive_cmd` function with the correct parameters, and fixed the formatting of the SQL queries in both if and else blocks. Additionally, I have added `check_return_code=True` to the `run_hive_cmd` function calls to handle return code checking.
