The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has several issues:
1. The condition to check if the table exists does not handle the case where the table is not in the result of the `run_hive_cmd`.
2. There is a missing format specification in the second `run_hive_cmd` call to insert the partition into the query.
3. The function does not handle the different cases of partition input correctly.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to:
1. Modify the condition to check if the table exists by checking for the presence of the table in the stdout. If the table is present, return True, otherwise, return False.
2. Update the second `run_hive_cmd` call to correctly insert the partition into the query.
3. Handle the different cases of partition input by using the `partition_spec` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        if isinstance(partition, dict):
            partition = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition))
        return bool(stdout)
```
This corrected version of the function should satisfy all the expected input/output values and pass the failing test cases.
