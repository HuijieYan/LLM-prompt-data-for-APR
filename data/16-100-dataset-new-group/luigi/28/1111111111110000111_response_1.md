The buggy function `table_exists` is failing due to case sensitivity issues when comparing table names. This bug is also reported on GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The cause of the bug:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table names with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The failing test attempts to compare "mytable" with "MyTable" and fails due to case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
  
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With the above changes, the `table_exists` function will now perform case-insensitive comparison, addressing the issue reported on GitHub. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the problem.
