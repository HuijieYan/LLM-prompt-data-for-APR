The buggy function `table_exists` is causing issues with case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The related GitHub issues suggest that the problem arises when checking for tables that are defined with capitalized names and need to be compared in a case-insensitive manner.

The bugs identified within the `table_exists` function are:
1. When the table name is in uppercase or a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, it is not correctly identified due to case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other class methods

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the `table.lower()` function is used to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the lowercase `stdout`. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the issue.
