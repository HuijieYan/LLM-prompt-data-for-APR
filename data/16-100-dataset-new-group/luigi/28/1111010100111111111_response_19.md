The problem with the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it doesn't handle case sensitivity properly. The method checks if the table exists in the output from a Hive command but doesn't take into account the case of the table name. This leads to failing tests because the method doesn't consider case-insensitive comparisons.

To fix this, we need to modify the `table_exists` method to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it to the output from the Hive command. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the table name is converted to lowercase using `table.lower()` before comparing it with the lowercase output from the Hive command `stdout.lower()`. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison and resolves the failing tests.

This fix also addresses the GitHub issues #896 and #897, which highlight the need to make the `table_exists` method case-insensitive.
