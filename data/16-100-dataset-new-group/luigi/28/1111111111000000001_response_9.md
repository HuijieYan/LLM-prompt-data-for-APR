The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be in the string formatting for the Hive command when a partition is specified. It is calling `self.partition_spec(partition)` and not passing `self` to the `partition_spec` method.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the correct partition spec is used in the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)  # Call the partition_spec method with self
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})')  # Use f-string for string formatting

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that the `self.partition_spec` method is called with the correct `self` parameter and uses the formatted string for the Hive command. This should fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function pass the failing test.
