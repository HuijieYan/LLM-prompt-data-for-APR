The bug in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class seems to be related to incorrect return values based on different conditions. It appears that the method is not handling partitioning correctly and may not be parsing the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function properly.

The failing test cases indicate that the method is returning incorrect results based on the input parameters and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The assertion errors show that the method is not returning the expected values.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves checking the conditions for handling partitions and parsing the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to ensure that the method returns the correct values.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_query))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- In the `else` block, the command to check for partitions is constructed properly with the `partition_query`.
- The `stdout` is converted directly to a boolean value instead of using conditional checks, ensuring that the method returns the correct result based on the presence of partitions.
