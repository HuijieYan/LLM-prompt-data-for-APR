The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't account for case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function returns False even if the table exists in Hive but is in a different case than what is provided.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive to be case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database)).lower()
            return table.lower() in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).lower()
            return table.lower() in stdout
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive. This will fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function work as expected.

With this fix, the function will pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue posted about making the table existence check case insensitive.
