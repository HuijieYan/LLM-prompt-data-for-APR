To fix the buggy function, we can modify the table_exists function to properly handle the output of the run_hive_cmd function and ensure that it correctly checks for the existence of the table and its partitions.

Here is a corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation of the changes made:
1. Updated the query in the if partition is None block to use 'show tables in {database}' instead of 'show tables like "{table}"' to properly list all tables in the database.
2. Split the stdout into a list of tables and checked if the table exists in the list.
3. Changed the query in the else block to use 'show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})' and used the partition_spec function to generate the partition specification.
4. Simplified the return statement by using bool(stdout) to check if the stdout is not empty.

The corrected function handles the output of run_hive_cmd properly and checks for the existence of the table and its partitions accordingly.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
