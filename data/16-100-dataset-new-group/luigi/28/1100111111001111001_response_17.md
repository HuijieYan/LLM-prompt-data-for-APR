The issue with the buggy `table_exists` function is that it returns the opposite boolean value of what is expected in the test cases. In other words, when the function should return `True`, it returns `False`, and vice versa. This is a critical issue that needs to be fixed.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `table_exists` function needs to be corrected so that it returns the expected boolean values based on the stdout and table existence checks.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True  # If stdout is not empty, the table exists
            else:
                return False  # If stdout is empty, the table does not exist
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` method should now correctly return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not. This should resolve the failing test cases.
