The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the case sensitivity of the comparison between the input table name and the table names in the database. When a table is checked for existence, the function performs a case-sensitive comparison, which can cause the function to return incorrect results, especially when the case of the input table name does not match the case of the actual table name in the database.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(p.lower() == self.partition_spec(partition).lower() for p in stdout.split())
```

In this corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the input table name and the table names in the database to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and will return the correct result regardless of the case of the table names.

By making this change, the function now satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
