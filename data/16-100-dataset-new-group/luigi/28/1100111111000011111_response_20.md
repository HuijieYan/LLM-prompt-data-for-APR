The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive, causing failures in the tests. The issue on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. The expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution indicate that the function is not handling the case insensitivity properly.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the input table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now handle case insensitive comparisons, as required.
