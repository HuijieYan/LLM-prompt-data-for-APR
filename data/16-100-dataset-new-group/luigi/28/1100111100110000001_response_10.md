The issue leading to the failure appears to be related to the `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class. The `run_hive_cmd` function is used to call Hive commands and can return different values based on whether the table exists or not. When the tests are run, an incorrect value is being returned, leading to the assertion errors.

The code branches in the `table_exists` function are intended to handle the cases when a partition is supplied or not. However, the issue seems to be related to the `run_hive_cmd` function calls where a query is made to check for the existence of a table or a partition.

A potential issue could be in the way the results of the Hive command are interpreted. The results could be not getting parsed correctly, leading to incorrect assertions in the tests. Additionally, there might be a problem with how the `stdout` variable is being checked for True or False, which could be leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the processing of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function is correct and accurately reflects whether the table or partition exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip().endswith(table)
        else:
            # Fixed placeholder from (%s) to (%s)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

The changes made involve using the `strip` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the `stdout` variable before checking if it ends with the actual table name. For the partition check, the `bool` method is used to directly convert the `stdout` variable into a Boolean value based on whether it contains any output.
