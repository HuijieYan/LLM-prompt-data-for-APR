The issue with the buggy function `table_exists` is that it does not handle the case where the `run_hive_cmd` output contains both the "OK" response and the table name. As a result, the function returns False when it should return True in this case.

In the provided failing test cases, we can see that the `run_command.return_value` is set to "OK" and "OK\nmytable" to simulate the response from `run_hive_cmd`. The expected values of the `stdout` variable are 'OK' and 'OK\nmytable'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to check if the table name is present in the `stdout` and return True if it is.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout  # Check if table is present in the stdout
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing test cases and return the expected output.
