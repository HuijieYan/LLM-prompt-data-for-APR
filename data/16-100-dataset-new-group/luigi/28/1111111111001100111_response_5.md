The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This leads to test failures when the table names have different case representations. The cause of this bug is the function performing a direct match between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command, without considering case sensitivity.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert both the table name and the stdout to the same case format (lowercase) before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing, the function will now be case insensitive and should pass all the failing tests mentioned.

Additionally, the code fix addresses the GitHub issues #896 and #1173 related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
