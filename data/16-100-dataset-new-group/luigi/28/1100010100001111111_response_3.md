From the GitHub issues, we can see that the problem with the buggy function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The expected behavior should be case-insensitive.

The bug in the function is that it directly checks if the table is present in the output without considering the case of the table name. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make it case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the entries in the `stdout` to lowercase. This makes the comparison case-insensitive, which addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports.
