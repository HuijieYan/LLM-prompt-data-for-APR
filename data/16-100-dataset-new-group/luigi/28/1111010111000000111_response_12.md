The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has an issue with case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. The failing test `test_table_exists` expects it to be case insensitive, but the current implementation is case sensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name against the entire `stdout` string without converting both to lowercase. This leads to a mismatch when the case of the table name in the `stdout` does not match the case of the table name provided.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now compare the table name and the `stdout` in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test.
