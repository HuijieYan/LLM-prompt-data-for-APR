The bug in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. It is failing to account for the case sensitivity of the table names in the Hive database.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `table_exists` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This modification addresses the case sensitivity issue by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This change will ensure that the method correctly identifies the existence of the table regardless of the case of the table name in the Hive database.
