Based on the failing test, the buggy function 'table_exists' in the HiveCommandClient class appears to have two potential error locations:

1. In the first part of the function, the 'run_hive_cmd' function is used to check if a table exists in a given database. The function is expecting to return a string 'OK' if the table exists. However, the 'return' statement is checking for a truthy value in 'stdout' which may not be correct.
2. In the second part of the function, the 'run_hive_cmd' function is used to check if a partition exists for a given table in a given database. The function is returning 'True' if stdout is not empty, otherwise 'False'. However, the 'run_hive_cmd' function result is not being checked against the partition spec.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not correctly handle the return value from the 'run_hive_cmd' function. The function is checking for truthy or falsy values in 'stdout' which may not be suitable for the intended logic.

To fix the bug, the 'table_exists' function should be modified to check the exact content of 'stdout' returned from the 'run_hive_cmd' function in both cases for table and partition existence.

Here's a corrected version of the 'table_exists' function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return 'OK' in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return any(partition.items() <= dict(map(str.strip, p.split('=')) for p in partition.split('/')) for partition in stdout.splitlines())
```

This corrected version utilizes the 'in' operator to check for the presence of 'OK' in the 'stdout' for table existence and checks if any of the partition items exist in the 'stdout' for partition existence. This should resolve the issues observed in the failing test cases.
