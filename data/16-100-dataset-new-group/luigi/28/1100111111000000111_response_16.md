The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it doesn't handle case insensitivity correctly, leading to failing test cases. The issue has been reported on GitHub with title "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive", indicating that checking for table existence should be case insensitive.

The bug occurs when checking whether a table exists or not, where the function compares the table name without considering case sensitivity. This leads to failing test cases for tables with names that are different only by case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case insensitive when checking if the table exists or not.

Here's the corrected version of the function `table_exists`:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # No need for explicit check. Return True if stdout is not empty, else False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive using `lower()` for both the table name and the result from `run_hive_cmd`, the corrected version of the function will pass the failing test cases and address the issues reported on GitHub.
