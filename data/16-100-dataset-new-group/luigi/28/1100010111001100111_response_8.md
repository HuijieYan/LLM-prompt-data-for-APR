In the buggy function `table_exists`, the issue is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for table existence. This leads to failing tests as it doesn't handle the case when the table name is in a different case than expected. The relevant GitHub issue #896 suggests that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function is now case insensitive and should pass all the failing tests.
