The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function does not handle case-insensitive table names properly, leading to failed test cases. This issue has been reported and discussed in GitHub issues #896 and #1505.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to check stdout against `table.lower()` to avoid case sensitivity issues. Below is the corrected version of the function that should pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With the above corrected version of the function, the test cases outlined in the failing test function should pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
