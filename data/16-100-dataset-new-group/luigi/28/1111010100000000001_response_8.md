To fix the buggy function, we need to address the following potential errors:

1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being used without being defined within the class or imported from another module. This will cause a NameError.
2. There is a missing closing parenthesis in the second stdout assignment within the else block.

The cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not defined or imported, which will result in a NameError when the function is called.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `run_hive_cmd` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class or import it from another module. Additionally, we should add the missing closing parenthesis in the second stdout assignment within the else block.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def run_hive_cmd(self, cmd):
        # Add the implementation of run_hive_cmd here
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
