## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The cause of the bug was that the table comparison wasn't case insensitive, leading to the test failures. This issue was documented in GitHub issues #896 and #974.

The strategy for fixing the bug was to make the comparison case insensitive, by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

By using the corrected function provided above, the bug should be fixed and all failing test cases should pass.
