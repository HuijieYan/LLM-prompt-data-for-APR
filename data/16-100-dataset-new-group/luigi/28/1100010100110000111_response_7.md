The issue is caused by the fact that the table_exists function checks for the exact table name in the hive database, without considering case sensitivity. This means that if the table name in the database is in a different case than what is provided to the function, the function will return False even if the table does exist.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to convert both the table name and the result from the hive database to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
With this modification, the function will convert both the table name and the database result to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case insensitive. This will resolve the failing test and also address the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity in table_exists function.
