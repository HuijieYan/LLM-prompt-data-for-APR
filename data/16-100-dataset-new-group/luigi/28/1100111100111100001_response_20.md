The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to how the `stdout` variable is being checked for the presence of the table in case of both partitioned and non-partitioned tables. 

The logic for checking if a table exists in the non-partitioned case seems incorrect. It relies on the truthiness of the `stdout` variable and checks whether the `table` string is present in `stdout`. However, the logic does not consider the case when `stdout` is `None`, which would lead to an incorrect evaluation. 

For the partitioned case, the logic seems to be using the `stdout` variable but does not properly evaluate its content to determine if the table exists.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for both the non-partitioned and partitioned cases to handle the `stdout` variable correctly.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is provided below:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Use bool to handle None and empty string
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Use bool to handle None and empty string
```

In the corrected version:
1. For the non-partitioned case, the `stdout` variable's truthiness is determined using `bool(stdout)`, which explicitly handles the case when `stdout` is None or an empty string.
2. For the partitioned case, the `partition` dictionary is converted to a string, and the correct `stdout` evaluation is performed using `bool(stdout)`.

This corrected version addresses the logic flaws and should now pass the failing tests.
