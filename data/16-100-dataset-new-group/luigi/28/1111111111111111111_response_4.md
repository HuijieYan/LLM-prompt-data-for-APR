The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by a case sensitivity issue when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function does not handle different casing scenarios properly, leading to incorrect results in the tests.

Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue, it is clear that the `table_exists` function needs to be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

The issue arises because the comparison between the table name and the table obtained from the command's stdout is case-sensitive, causing the assertion failures.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout needs to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity issues.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it will address the issue raised on GitHub (#896) regarding case insensitivity in table existence checks.
