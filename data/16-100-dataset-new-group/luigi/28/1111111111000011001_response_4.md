The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions are not being called correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct parameters and that the `partition_spec` function is also called correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the call to `run_hive_cmd` to use the correct parameters for both the base and partitioned tables.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases, satisfying the expected input/output values.
