The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The function compares the table name without considering case, which causes tests to fail when comparing a capitalized table name with the lowercase result from the Hive query.

The bug's cause is evident from the GitHub issue, where the community member highlighted the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to account for the case insensitivity of Hive, which returns table names in lowercase regardless of their definition case.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be updated to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase `stdout` to make the comparison case insensitive. This fix aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function now checks the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase `stdout` to perform a case-insensitive comparison in line with the requested fix in the GitHub issue.
