The bug arises when the `table_exists` function fails to correctly handle case sensitivity. The function doesn't check for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner, leading to issues when the input table name is given in different cases than what's returned from the Hive command. This leads to inconsistent test results, as the function doesn't account for case differences in the table name.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By using the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence. This fixes the bug reported on GitHub and aligns with the expected input/output values across all test cases.
