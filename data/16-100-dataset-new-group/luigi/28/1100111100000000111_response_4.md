The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive when checking for table existence. The issue on GitHub indicates that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, while Hive returns them as lower case. This causes the test to fail. The proposed fix is to check `table.lower()` against `stdout.lower()` to avoid case sensitivity issues.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # existing code...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # to simplify the if-else block
```

In the corrected version:
- When `partition` is `None`, the function now checks `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to make the comparison case insensitive.
- The `if-else` block for checking the existence of partitions has been simplified using the `bool` function to directly return the boolean value of `stdout`.

This revised code addresses the case sensitivity issue in checking for table existence as reported in the GitHub issue.
