The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file is failing to properly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. Specifically, when the table does exist, the function is returning the opposite of what is expected, causing the test case to fail with an AssertionError.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to adjust the conditional checks and the return values in the `table_exists` function. The function should return `True` when the table exists and `False` when the table does not exist.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test cases.
