The buggy function `table_exists` contains an error in the conditional statements that compare the stdout with the table name. The first `if` statement checks if the table name is included in the stdout, and the second `if` statement checks if the stdout is not empty. However, in the failing test cases, the functions return the incorrect values.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect comparison between the table name and the stdout. The failing test cases show that the expected outputs are not aligned with the actual outputs. Also, the GitHub issue #896 confirms that there is an issue with case sensitivity in `table_exists`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This change will make the comparison case insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
