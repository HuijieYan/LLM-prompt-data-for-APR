The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional statements that check the value of `stdout`. The first conditional statement checks if `stdout` has any value and if the table is in `stdout`. The second conditional statement simply checks if `stdout` has any value. These checks may not be accurate and are leading to the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional statements to check if the table is in `stdout` and return `True` if it is found, and `False` if not found.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout
```

This corrected version should now return the expected output and pass the failing tests.
