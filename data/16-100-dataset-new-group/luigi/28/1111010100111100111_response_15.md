The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` causes the test cases to fail due to inconsistency in case sensitivity when comparing table names. The failing test cases highlight the incorrect behavior of the function when determining if a table exists in the database.

The buggy function has logic that checks if a table exists in the database by running a Hive command and examining the output. However, it does not account for case insensitivity, leading to failures when comparing table names with incorrect case.

The GitHub issues describe the problem as tables being defined with capitalized names, while Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lower case. The suggested fix is to check the output of the Hive command against the lowercase version of the table name.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase output of the Hive command. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version compares the lowercase version of both the table name and the output of the Hive command, ensuring case insensitivity. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue that addresses the case sensitivity problem.
