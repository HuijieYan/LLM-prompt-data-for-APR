The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not properly handling the comparison of the table name within the output. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the table name is a substring of another table name in the output. 

A better approach would be to split the rows in the output and check for an exact match of the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the output by newlines and checks for an exact match of the table name in each row. For the case where `partition` is not `None`, the function simply returns if `stdout` has any content.
