The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name is in a different case than expected. The issue has been raised on GitHub and a potential fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses this bug:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other methods

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `table_exists` function converts both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before checking for the table's existence. This makes the comparison case insensitive and ensures that the function works as expected in different cases.
