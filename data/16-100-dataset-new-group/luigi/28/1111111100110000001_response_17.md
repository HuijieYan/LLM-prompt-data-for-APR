The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the `show tables` and `show partition` commands in Hive return tables names in upper case, and the returned table names are not matched against the input table name. Consequently, table existence is determined incorrectly, and this results in failing tests with unexpected assertion errors. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the table names are case-insensitive in the table existence check.

Here is the updated and corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive table name check
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, we have used the `lower()` method to convert the table names to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the table names are matched in a case-insensitive manner, which fixes the bug in the `table_exists` function and allows it to pass the failing tests.
