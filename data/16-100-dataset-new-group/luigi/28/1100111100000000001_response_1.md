## Analysis
The `table_exists` function seems to be designed to check if a table exists in a given database, with an optional partition. It's making use of the `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` functions to execute the necessary Hive commands.

## Potential Error Locations
1. There may be an issue with the `run_hive_cmd` function not returning the expected result.
2. There may be an issue with the construction of the Hive command string when `partition` is not None.
3. There may be an issue with the condition checking for the existence of the table.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the format of the Hive command string in the `table_exists` function when dealing with a partition.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the implementation of the `run_hive_cmd` function to ensure it returns the expected output.
2. Double-check the construction of the Hive command string when dealing with a partition.
3. Review the condition for checking the existence of the table to ensure it's correctly evaluating the output of the Hive commands.

## Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}"'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
