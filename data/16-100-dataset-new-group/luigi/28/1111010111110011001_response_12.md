To fix the bug in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class, let's first identify the potential error locations and then suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.

### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` method checks if the table exists in the specified database by using a Hive command.
2. In the first case, the Hive command `show tables like "{1}"` is used to find the table.
3. In the second case, the Hive command `show partitions` is used to find the partitions of the table.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking the existence of the table based on stdout seems to be incorrect.
2. The formatting of the Hive command in the else block may not be correct.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditions for checking the existence of the table and partitions are not effectively handling the stdout from the Hive commands. As a result, the return value of the method is not always correct.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the condition for checking the existence of the table based on stdout.
2. Ensure that the Hive command for checking partitions is correctly formatted and executed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we have made changes to the conditions for checking the existence of the table and partitions. We also ensured that the Hive commands are correctly formatted and executed. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
