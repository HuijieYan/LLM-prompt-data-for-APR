The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditions for the `if` and `else` statements. 

The cause of the bug is that the conditions for checking if the table exists are not properly handled, and the function does not return a boolean value as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions for the `if` and `else` statements to properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and return a boolean value based on the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we split the stdout on new lines and check if the table exists in the list. For the partition case, we directly return the boolean result of the `stdout` check.
