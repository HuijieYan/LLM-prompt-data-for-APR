## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = '' if partition is None else ' '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
    ```


### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are the `run_hive_cmd` function calls and the construction of the command strings.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being used correctly in the `table_exists` function. The string construction for the Hive commands is also incorrect, which can lead to errors in executing the commands.
4. To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called with the correct parameters and the construction of the Hive command strings needs to be revised to ensure the correct format and incorporation of the `partition` parameter.
5. The corrected version of the buggy function is provided above. The `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct parameters, and the construction of the Hive command strings is revised to include the `partition` parameter when necessary. Additionally, the return statement in the `else` block is simplified to directly return the boolean value based on the `stdout` value.
