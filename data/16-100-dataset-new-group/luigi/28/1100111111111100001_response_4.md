The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a database, and it accepts an optional `partition` parameter. The issue arises from the conditional branch that handles the case when the `partition` parameter is not None. In this case, the function incorrectly constructs a Hive command string and conditionally checks the output to determine if the table exists in the specified partition.

Based on the failing test cases, the issue appears to be with how the `stdout` variable is being handled. In the first set of test cases, the function fails to correctly detect whether a table exists. In the second set of test cases, the function incorrectly checks for table existence based on case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the conditional branch for handling the `partition` parameter should be reviewed and modified.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    [...]

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive table name check
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join("{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items())
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)  # If stdout is not empty, the table exists in the specified partition
```

In the corrected version, the `stdout` is checked for table existence based on a case-insensitive comparison. Additionally, the partition string is now constructed using the actual key-value pairs from the `partition` parameter.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
