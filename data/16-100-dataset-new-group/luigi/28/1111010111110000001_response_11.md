The bug in the `table_exists` function is with the logic that checks if the standard output of the `run_hive_cmd` command contains the queried table name. The logic incorrectly returns the opposite of what is expected, thus failing the test. Additionally, when handling the case with partitions, the condition branching is not properly implemented, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic should be corrected to properly handle the scenarios involving standard output from the `run_hive_cmd` command and the partitioned tables.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        stdout = ""
        if partition:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition (%s)""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            if partition:
                return bool(stdout)
            else:
                return table in stdout
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the function updates the condition to properly handle the case where `stdout` is not empty. It also correctly handles the partitioned table check. After updating the function with the corrected logic, it should pass the failing tests.
