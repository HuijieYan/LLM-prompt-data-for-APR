Based on the failing tests and the runtime input/output values, it appears that the bug is related to how the `table_exists` function is handling the `table` parameter. The function does not seem to handle case-insensitivity properly, which leads to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the `table` parameter and the `stdout` value is case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` value to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions from the class

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
