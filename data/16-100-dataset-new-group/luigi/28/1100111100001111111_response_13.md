To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by checking if the lowercase version of the table name is present in the lowercase version of the stdout. This will address the issue described in the GitHub report by making the function case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions in the class

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now return the expected results, including for case-insensitive table names, and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
