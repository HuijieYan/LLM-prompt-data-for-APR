The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition for checking if the table exists is inverted. The current implementation returns `stdout and table in stdout`, which means it returns `False` when `stdout` is empty, even if the table exists in the database. This is the root cause of the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the condition in the `if` statement to check if the table is in `stdout` when `stdout` is not empty, and return `True` if it exists, and `False` if it doesn't.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected implementation, the function will return the expected results for the provided failing tests.
