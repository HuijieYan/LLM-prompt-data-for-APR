To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function inside the `HiveCommandClient` class needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table names. The fix should involve converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the check for table existence is made case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is not affected by the case of the table names.

This fix satisfies the failing tests, which expect the `table_exists` function to perform case-insensitive checks on the table names. It also addresses the GitHub issue #896 by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

After applying this fix, the failing tests should pass, and the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case-insensitive table name comparisons.
