The bug in the provided code is that the `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. As a result, the test cases are failing when the table names have different cases.

The cause of the bug is explained by the failing tests, which show that the function is not handling case differences properly. The failing test cases with different table names and partitions reveal that the function is not effectively checking the existence of the tables.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to handle case insensitivity by converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now handle case insensitivity for table names and pass the failing test cases. This solution aligns with the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

This corrected version of the function should help resolve the issue and ensure that the tests pass as expected.
