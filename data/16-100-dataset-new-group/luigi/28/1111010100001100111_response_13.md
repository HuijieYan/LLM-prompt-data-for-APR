The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` from `luigi/contrib/hive.py` doesn't handle case insensitivity while checking for table existence in Hive, as evidenced by the GitHub issue. The issue arises when the table name is provided in a different case than what is returned by Hive, leading to incorrect validation of table existence. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case sensitivity issues.

The buggy function's error location lies in the comparison of the `table` with the `stdout` in both the cases. It does not handle the case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the function should consistently convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, ensuring case insensitivity when checking for table existence. The correction should also return `False` when `stdout` is not what's generally returned upon table non-existence.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during the comparison in both cases, the corrected version addresses the case sensitivity issue when checking for table existence in the Hive.
