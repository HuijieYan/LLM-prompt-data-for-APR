The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it does not correctly handle case-insensitive table names in Hive. The bug results in the function returning `False` even when the table exists but has a different case compared to the input table name.

The expected behavior is for the function to be case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

### Error Location:
The potential error lies in the comparison of the table name with the content of `stdout`. The function does not handle case-insensitive comparisons, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the table name with the output of the Hive command without considering the case. This causes false negatives when the table names have different cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison. This way, the comparison will be case-insensitive and will accurately determine the existence of the table in Hive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the table name and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison and resolves the bug.
