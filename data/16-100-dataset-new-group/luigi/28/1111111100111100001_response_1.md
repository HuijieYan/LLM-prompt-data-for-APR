The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to the incorrect comparison of the output value. It seems that the function is not properly handling the case insensitivity. When comparing the table name against the stdout, it does not account for case sensitivity, leading to the failure of the tests.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table name against the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).lower()
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout  # Perform case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).lower()
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout  # Perform case-insensitive comparison
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the comparison is not sensitive to the case of the table name.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
