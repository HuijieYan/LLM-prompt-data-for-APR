Based on the buggy function and the provided expected input/output values, it seems that the bug is related to the `run_hive_cmd` function and the logic for checking the existence of a table in a Hive database.

The bug is likely caused by the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is called and how the stdout is being checked for the existence of the table.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called correctly and that the stdout is being checked for the correct value representing the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout.strip() == table
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} PARTITION ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout.strip() == table
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called by passing the correct HiveQL queries to check the existence of the table. We also fixed the logic for checking the existence of the table in the stdout, comparing the stripped stdout with the table name to determine its existence.
