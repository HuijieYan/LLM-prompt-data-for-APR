The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the way the stdout variable is being used to determine if a table exists or not. The function uses the presence of the table name in the stdout variable to make this determination.

The buggy function's logic is based on the assumption that the output of the Hive command will always contain the exact name of the table when using the 'show tables' command, and the exact name of the partition when using the 'show partitions' command. However, this assumption is incorrect as the output may not always directly match the table or partition name provided due to various reasons, such as case sensitivity and newline characters.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to explicitly check for the existence of the table or partition in the stdout variable, accounting for potential discrepancies including case sensitivity and newline characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return any(partition.items() <= dict(x.split('=') for x in p.split('/')).items() for p in stdout.split('\n') if p)
        else:
            return False
```
