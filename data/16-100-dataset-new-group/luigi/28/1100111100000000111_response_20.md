## Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does a case-sensitive check when it should be doing a case-insensitive check against the `stdout` from the Hive command.

## Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `table_exists` function where it checks if the `table` is in the `stdout`. It needs to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing an issue because Hive is case-insensitive, but the `table_exists` function is doing a case-sensitive comparison. This causes the function to return incorrect results, especially for tables with mixed case names.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the `table` and the `stdout` from the Hive command. This can be achieved by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
