```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Fixed version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            if isinstance(partition, str):
                partition_string = partition
            else:
                partition_string = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])

            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_string))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

The buggy function was not handling the partition parameter correctly, leading to incorrect results in the test cases. The issue was that the `partition` parameter wasn't being converted to the expected format when building the SQL command in the `else` block of the function. 

To fix this, I added a check to see if the partition is a string, and if not, converted it into the expected format by joining the key-value pairs. Additionally, I changed the condition to return `bool(stdout)` directly, which is a cleaner and more idiomatic way to check if the stdout contains any data.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
