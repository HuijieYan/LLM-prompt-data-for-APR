The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name to the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This results in the function returning incorrect results.

The buggy function does not account for case sensitivity in the table name comparison, leading to the incorrect return value. This can be verified from the failing tests and the corresponding error messages. The function does not handle case differences between the input table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This causes the tests to fail when it encounters case differences in the table name.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is done after converting both to lowercase. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, fixing the bug.

The corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub. This change also aligns with the GitHub issue discussions about making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
