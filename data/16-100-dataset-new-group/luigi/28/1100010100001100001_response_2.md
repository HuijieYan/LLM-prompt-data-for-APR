The bug in the provided function is that the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` in the `if` block is incorrect. This condition will return `stdout` if it is not an empty string and `table` is present in `stdout`, but it should return `True` if `table` is in `stdout`, and `False` otherwise. The condition should only check for the presence of `table` in `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout  # The condition is modified to only check the presence of 'table' in 'stdout'
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return if stdout is truthy (True if not empty, False if empty)
```

Now, the conditions in both branches of the if-else statement are fixed. It will correctly check for the presence of `table` in `stdout` and return `True` if found, and in the case of a partition, it will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty.

This should address the bug and allow the function to work correctly for all provided cases.
