Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The comparison statement `table in stdout` may not handle the case sensitivity issue.
- The comparison statement `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` suggested in the GitHub issue has not been implemented.

Explanation of the bug:
The GitHub issue points out that the current implementation of the `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity, which causes the test to fail when checking for an existing table with capitalized names. The suggestion is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison statements to handle case insensitivity. Specifically, we should modify the comparison statements in the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercased table name with the lowercased `stdout` string.
Additionally, when `partition` is None, the function should handle the case insensitivity for table names.

Here's the corrected version of the function considering the suggestions from the GitHub issue:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle the case sensitivity issue when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
