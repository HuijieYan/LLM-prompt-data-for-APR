#### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function `table_exists` is using `run_hive_cmd` for running Hive commands but it's not clear whether `run_hive_cmd` is correctly implemented or if it's producing the expected output.

2. The condition for checking if `stdout` is not null is not properly handled, which might be leading to incorrect returns.

3. The string formatting for constructing the Hive commands might be incorrect or causing issues.

#### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be arising from incorrect handling of the return output from `run_hive_cmd` and incorrect string formatting. Due to this, the conditions are not properly being evaluated, leading to incorrect results and assertions failing in the test cases.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the implementation of `run_hive_cmd` and ensure that it's correctly implemented and producing the expected output.

2. Properly handle the condition for checking if `stdout` is not null and return the appropriate values based on the queries.

3. Verify the string formatting for constructing the Hive commands and ensure that it's correct.

#### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition for checking the presence of the table in `stdout` has been modified to handle cases where `stdout` might be null.
- String formatting has been corrected for constructing the Hive commands.
- Using `bool(stdout)` directly to return the appropriate boolean value based on `stdout` being empty or not.
