The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to stem from the conditional logic used to check if a table exists in the database. In particular, the condition to check if `stdout` is not empty is likely causing the incorrect behavior.

The buggy function fails to accurately determine whether a table exists in the Hive database, as evidenced by the failed test cases. In the specific failing test case, the function incorrectly returns `False` instead of `True`. This is due to the conditional logic used when checking the `stdout` variable and comparing it to the table name.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to modify the condition that checks if `stdout` contains the table name. Additionally, the conditional logic within the `table_exists` function should be made more explicit to handle different cases and edge scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_filter = " AND ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_filter))

        return bool(stdout.strip())  # Check if stdout has any content
```

In this corrected version, the conditional to check if `stdout` contains the table name is made more explicit by utilizing the `in` operator on the `stdout` variable. Additionally, when handling partitions, the partition filter is constructed using a list comprehension and then passed to the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `bool(stdout.strip())` expression is used to ensure that `stdout` has content before returning `True`.

With these modifications, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
