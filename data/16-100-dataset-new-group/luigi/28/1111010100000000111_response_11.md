## Analysis:
The bug is related to the table_exists function in the HiveCommandClient class. The issue indicates that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The bug arises because the function does not handle case insensitivity when checking the table existence.

## Bug Locations:
1. The function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name in stdout.
2. The function does not account for the possibility of table names being capitalized or in a different case than expected.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the table_exists function only checks for an exact match of the table name in the output from hive commands. As a result, table names that are in a different case from what is expected will cause the function to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the table_exists function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This way, the comparison will be case insensitive and accurate.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # The corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    
```

The corrected version of the table_exists function now converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case insensitive. This resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports.
