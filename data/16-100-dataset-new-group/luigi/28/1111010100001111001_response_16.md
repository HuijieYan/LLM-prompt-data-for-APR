The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely caused by the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`, which does not handle the case when `stdout` is empty. Additionally, the second condition checking for `stdout` and returning `True` or `False` is redundant and can be simplified. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to explicitly check if `stdout` is not empty, and then check for the existence of the table name within `stdout`. If `stdout` is empty, we should return `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout is not None and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None
```

This corrected version introduces a check for `stdout is not None` before checking for the presence of the table name within `stdout`. If `stdout` is empty (None), the function will return False, which aligns with the expected behavior.
