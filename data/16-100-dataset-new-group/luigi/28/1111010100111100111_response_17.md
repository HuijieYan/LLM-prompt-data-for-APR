### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The first potential error location is the line `stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))`. This is where the function interacts with the `run_hive_cmd` being mocked in the test cases, and it's here that the function should consider case-insensitivity. 
2. The second potential error location is the line `stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))`. Similar to the first case, this is where the function interacts with the mocked `run_hive_cmd` and should consider case-insensitivity.

### Explanation of the cause of the bug
The failing test cases indicate that the `table_exists` function does not consider case-insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output obtained from `run_hive_cmd`. The test expects case-insensitive comparison, but the function is only using exact matching, leading to assertions failure. This issue was reported on GitHub as issue #896, highlighting that Hive is case-insensitive, and the function should consider this with case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output obtained from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase or uppercase before the comparison.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            if stdout:
                return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
            else:
                return False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` is case-insensitive, which addresses the reported bug and should make the failing test cases pass. This corrected version resolves the issue posted in GitHub and should handle case-sensitive table name comparison in the `table_exists` function.
