Based on the error message and the GitHub issues, it is clear that the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The table names are case insensitive in Hive, so the function `table_exists` needs to be modified to make it case insensitive. The current implementation fails to account for this case insensitivity, causing the test cases to fail.

The cause of the bug is the comparison of the table name with the table names listed in the stdout. Since Hive table names are case insensitive, the comparison should also be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, the function will now be case insensitive and the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issues reported in GitHub.
