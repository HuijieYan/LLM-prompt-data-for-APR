The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it doesn't handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This bug is highlighted in the GitHub issue with a suggested fix to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

The buggy function specifically fails to handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. It performs a straightforward comparison between the `table` name and the names returned in the `stdout` from the Hive command, without considering case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the `table` name and the names returned in the `stdout` to lower case before performing the comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive, as desired according to the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the names returned in the `stdout` are converted to lower case using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive as requested in the GitHub issue.
