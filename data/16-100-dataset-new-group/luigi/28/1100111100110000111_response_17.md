The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing the test to fail when checking for table existence in different cases. This behavior is inconsistent with Hive's case-insensitive nature. The corresponding GitHub issue (#896) confirms this inconsistency and provides a potential solution to fix it by checking the standard output against the lowercase form of the table name.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check for table existence by comparing the lowercase table name against the lowercase standard output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # performing case-insensitive check
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # simplified the condition
    
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive check for table existence, as suggested in the GitHub issue. This should resolve the failing test and fix the bug.
