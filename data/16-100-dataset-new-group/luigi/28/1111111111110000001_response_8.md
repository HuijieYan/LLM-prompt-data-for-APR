There are a few issues we can identify from the buggy function, related functions, and failing tests:

1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not directly located in the `HiveCommandClient` class but rather in the same file. This function is called in the `table_exists` method, but it's not being imported within the file or referenced correctly. Therefore, it is not accessible unless the correct import is made or a reference to it is established.
   
2. The `partition_spec` method is defined multiple times with the same name, which could lead to confusion and errors in the code. There seems to be a mix-up between the `HiveCommandClient` class and other related functions in the same file.

3. The failing test is showing that the `table_exists` function is returning incorrect results. The first test case passes for the value `"mytable"`, but the second test case fails to return `True` for the same input.

To fix the issues, we should ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is imported and referenced correctly, and the `partition_spec` method should be defined only once, in the `HiveCommandClient` class. After these changes, we can modify the `table_exists` function to correctly use `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` to fetch the correct results for the test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd(
                f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})"
            )

            return bool(stdout)

    def run_hive_cmd(self, hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
        # Please add the body of this function if it's currently missing
```

The key change is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is now accessed using `self.run_hive_cmd` to ensure that it's accessible within the `HiveCommandClient` class, and the `partition_spec` method is only defined once within the same class. These changes should address the identified issues and make the test cases pass successfully.
