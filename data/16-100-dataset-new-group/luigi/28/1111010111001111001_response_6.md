The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a given table exists in a specified database, and optionally with a specified partition. However, there are some issues with the logic inside the function that causes it to fail in the provided test cases.

### Issues:
1. In the first part of the function, when `partition` is `None`, the use of `and` to check if `stdout` and `table` are present is incorrect. This may result in unexpected behavior, especially when `stdout` is not exactly equal to `table`.
2. In the second part of the function, when `partition` is not `None`, the query construction for checking partitions is incorrect. It does not match the expected format of the `show partitions` command.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the conditional statement for the first part to properly check if `table in stdout`.
2. Fix the query construction in the second part to correctly format the `show partitions` command with the specified partition.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            partition_filter = " and ".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_filter))

            return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly determine whether a table exists, and the provided test cases should pass without any issues.
