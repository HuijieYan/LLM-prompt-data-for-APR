## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with related functions.
The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which inherits from `HiveClient`. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions from the same file. The `run_hive_cmd` function is used to execute Hive commands, and the `partition_spec` function is used to generate partition specifications.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
1. The second part of the `if` block in the `table_exists` function where the `run_hive_cmd` is called with the parameter is a potential error location.
2. The usage of `self.partition_spec(partition)` within the `run_hive_cmd` call could be a source of the bug.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions.
The bug in this function could be related to the incorrect usage of the `partition_spec` function or the incorrect formatting of the Hive command in the `run_hive_cmd` call. Additionally, the conditions for returning `True` or `False` might be affected by the incorrect execution of the Hive command.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
To fix the bug, it's essential to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct Hive command and that the `partition_spec` function is generating the correct partition specifications. Additionally, the conditions for returning `True` or `False` should be checked to ensure they accurately reflect the existence of the table or partition.

## Corrected version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use `{0}`; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))  # Removed the semicolon at the end

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use `{0}`; show partitions `{1}` partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))

            return bool(stdout)  # Simplified the conditional return
```
In the corrected version:
1. Removed the unnecessary semicolon at the end of the Hive commands.
2. Updated the formatting of Hive commands to use backticks for database and table names and added the `partition_str` variable for the partition specification.
3. Simplified the `if-else` block to return `True` or `False` based on the existence of `stdout`.
