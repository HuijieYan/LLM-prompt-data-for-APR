The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case-insensitive for table names. The issue seems to be related to the fact that Hive is case insensitive when returning table names in lowercase, while the input table names might not be in lowercase.

The actual bug is that the function is doing a direct comparison of the table name with the stdout, which can contain table names in lowercase. This creates a case-sensitivity issue.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to compare the lowercase of the table name with the lowercase of the stdout to make it case-insensitive. Additionally, we can ignore case when comparing the table names by converting both to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version modifies the comparisons to be case-insensitive, making it more reliable when dealing with different table naming conventions. This resolves the issue posted in the GitHub as well.
