Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the `table_exists` function. The function currently does a direct comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, which may cause issues due to case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

With this change, the function should now pass the failing test cases and also address the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
