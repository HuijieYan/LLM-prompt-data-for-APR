The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue reported on GitHub confirms this and suggests that the function should be case insensitive.

The problem is evident in the failing test cases, where the test with the table name 'mytable' passes, but the test with the table name 'MyTable' fails. This happens because the function checks for an exact match between the provided table name and the table name returned from `stdout`, which is case sensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the provided table name and the table names in `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison using `lower()`, the function will now return the correct result for case insensitive checks. This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussions and satisfies all the failing test cases.
