The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the `stdout` variable. In both cases where `partition` is None, the function returns `stdout and table in stdout`, which checks if `stdout` is not empty and if `table` is in `stdout`. However, in the second part of the function, when `partition` is not None, it checks for the existence of a table based on the partition specification, but it always returns True.

The cause of the bug is that the check for the existence of a table based on the partition specification is not implemented correctly. Also, the condition `if stdout` in the second part of the function is always returning True because an empty string is considered truthy in Python.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the second part of the function to correctly check for the existence of a table based on the partition specification and handle the empty string case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check for the truthiness of `stdout` using the `bool` function to handle the case where `stdout` may be an empty string. Additionally, we store the result of `self.partition_spec(partition)` in a separate variable `partition_str` to ensure that it is correctly used in the command string.
