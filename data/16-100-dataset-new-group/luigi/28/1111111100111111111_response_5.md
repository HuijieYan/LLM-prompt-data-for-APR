The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. The bug is related to an open GitHub issue #896, which states that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive.

The bug leads to failing test cases because the function does not check the case of the table name when comparing it with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This causes the function to return incorrect results when the table name case does not match the case of the output.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase and compare them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will resolve the failing test cases and the open GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them. This change makes the comparison case insensitive, addressing the failing test cases and the open GitHub issue.
