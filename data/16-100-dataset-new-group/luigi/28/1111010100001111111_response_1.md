Based on the information provided, it appears that the bug stems from a case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. Since Hive is case insensitive while returning table names in lower case, this leads to test failures when comparing the input table name with the returned table names.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to modify the function to check for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner by comparing the input table name with the returned table names after converting them to lower case.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.strip().split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected function, the `table` variable is converted to lowercase and compared to the table names returned from Hive, which are also converted to lowercase. This approach ensures that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

This fix satisfies the expected runtime input/output values and resolves the reported issue.
