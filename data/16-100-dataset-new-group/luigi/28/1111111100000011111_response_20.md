The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug that causes it to be case sensitive when checking for table existence.

The bug is in the conditional statement where it checks the existence of the table. It needs to check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the stdout to make it case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the function `table_exists` should now return the expected values for the given test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
