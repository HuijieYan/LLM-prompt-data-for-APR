The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug that causes it to fail when checking for the existence of a table in Hive due to case sensitivity. The bug is related to a GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".

The bug is specifically described in the GitHub issue, where it states that tables defined with capitalized names may fail the test in the `table_exists` function if the table name is returned in lowercase by Hive. This is because Hive is case insensitive, and it returns table names in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the table names in the `stdout` should be made case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` is used to make the comparison case insensitive, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
