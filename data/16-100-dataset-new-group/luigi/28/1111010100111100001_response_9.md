The issue seems to be with how the return value of the `table_exists` function is being handled. The function checks if the `stdout` is not empty and whether the table name is in the `stdout`. If the partition is not None, it runs a different command to check for the table and returns `True` if it exists. However, in some cases, the return value is not being handled correctly, leading to failed assertions in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to return `True` only if the table name is present in the `stdout` and not just if the `stdout` is not empty. Additionally, for the case when a partition is provided, we should return the result of checking if the `stdout` is not empty, rather than returning `True`. We should also consider case insensitivity when checking the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_exists = any(existing_table.lower() == table.lower() for existing_table in (stdout or "").split())
        return table_exists
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should address the issues and pass the failing tests.
