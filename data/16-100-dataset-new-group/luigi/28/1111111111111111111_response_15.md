The bug in the code seems to stem from the case sensitivity of the table name when checking for its existence in the database. The incorrect method of comparison results in test failures. To fix the bug, the function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's a corrected version of the function that should pass the failing tests and address the GitHub issue:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function compares the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison. This should address the failing tests and the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity.
