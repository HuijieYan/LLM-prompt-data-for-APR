The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The test cases are failing because the function does not take into account the case of the table name when comparing against the output of the `run_hive_cmd()` function.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lower case for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now handle case sensitivity properly and pass the failing test cases. This solution also addresses GitHub issue #896 by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive and aligns with the proposal in the GitHub issue for the bug.

This correction resolves the bug and aligns with the expected input/output values as well as addresses the GitHub issues associated with the bug.
