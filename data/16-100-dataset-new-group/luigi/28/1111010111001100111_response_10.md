The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases. The issue stems from the case sensitivity of the table name comparison with the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons for the table names, passing all the failing test cases and resolving the GitHub issue.
