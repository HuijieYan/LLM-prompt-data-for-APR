The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not case insensitive, causing test failures because it does not handle different casing scenarios properly. The GitHub issue #896 has been raised to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The potential error location is within the conditionals where the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is done without considering the case.

The bug is caused by the fact that the buggy function does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking for table existence. This is shown in the failing test case where the `table_exists` function returns unexpected results due to case differences between the table name and the actual table in the database.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should handle case sensitivity properly by comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd` in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table, resolving the case-related issues as discussed in the GitHub issue #896.
