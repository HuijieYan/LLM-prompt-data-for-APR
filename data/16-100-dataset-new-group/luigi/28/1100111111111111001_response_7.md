The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name. Additionally, there is a potential issue in the conditional logic for checking the existence of the table based on the presence of the table name in `stdout`.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditional logic to check for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

This version of the function checks for the presence of the table name in a case-insensitive manner using the `lower()` method and returns the appropriate boolean value. This change should address the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
