The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not check for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name is provided in a different case than the one returned by `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lower case for comparison. This approach will make the comparison case insensitive and satisfy the GitHub issue #896.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now pass all the test cases provided and will address the issue described in GitHub.
