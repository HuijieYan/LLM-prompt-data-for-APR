The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing it to fail when checking for table existence in a case-insensitive manner. The bug is caused by not considering case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison is made. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

This modified function should now pass the failing test and be case-insensitive when checking for table existence.
