The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class from `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table, which causes tests to fail due to the case sensitivity of the table names returned in stdout.

The bug is caused by the `table` parameter being checked against the `stdout` without being converted to lowercase, making the comparison case sensitive.

To fix the bug, we should convert both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With these changes, the `table` is converted to lowercase before being compared to the `stdout`, ensuring the table name check is case insensitive as per the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue. This addresses the problem without causing any adverse effects elsewhere.
