The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition for checking the table in the database is incorrect. It is not properly handling the case where the table exists.

The buggy function checks if `stdout` is not empty and if the `table` is in `stdout`. However, in the failing tests, the `stdout` contains both "OK" and the table name. So, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` will be true, even if the table doesn't exist.

To fix this bug, we should check if the table name is a separate word in the `stdout`. This means that we should check if the `stdout` contains the exact table name and not just a part of it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and f"OK\n{table}" in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version will check if "OK" and the table name are in `stdout`, ensuring that the `table` does indeed exist in the `stdout`. This should fix the failing tests.
