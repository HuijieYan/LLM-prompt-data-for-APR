## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:

The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The GitHub issue suggests that the function should be made case-insensitive, as currently, it fails when the table name is given in a different case from what is returned by the Hive query.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:

The potential error is in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` variable. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the comparison must also be made case-insensitive to resolve the issue.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the GitHub Issue information:

The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function compares the input table name directly with the output from Hive, without considering the case sensitivity. This causes the comparison to fail when the case of the table name does not match the case of the output from Hive.

The GitHub issue has already provided a solution to fix the bug, which is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison is made. This resolves the case sensitivity issue as reported in the GitHub issue.
