The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the way it handles the `stdout` variable. It is currently always returning `True` when `stdout` is not empty and `False` otherwise, which is not correct.

To fix the bug, we should check for the exact table name in the `stdout` variable when partition is `None`, and we should check for the exact partition in the `stdout` variable when partition is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition ({3});""".format(database, database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return isinstance(stdout, str) and partition in stdout.split('\n')
```

With this corrected function, it should now handle both cases (with and without partition) correctly and return the expected output values for all the given test cases.
