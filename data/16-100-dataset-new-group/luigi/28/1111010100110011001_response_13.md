The bug in the function `table_exists` is that the stdout is not being checked correctly. The function only checks if `stdout` exists, regardless of its actual contents. This causes the test cases to fail when the expected `stdout` content is not being handled properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check the content of `stdout` correctly and return `True` only if the table exists in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout or table.capitalize() in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout is not None and stdout.strip() != ''
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if the table exists in the `stdout` and return `True` or `False` accordingly. This should resolve the failing test cases.
