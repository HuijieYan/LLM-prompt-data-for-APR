The buggy function `table_exists` is checking the presence of a table in a Hive database, and it calls the function `run_hive_cmd` to execute a Hive command and get the output, and depending on the output, it determines if a table exists or not. Additionally, it calls the function `partition_spec` to build a Hive partition specification for a given partition.

The bug in the `table_exists` function is primarily due to the logic of checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. It checks if the standard output (`stdout`) is not empty to determine if the table exists or not, but it does not consider all possible response cases from the `run_hive_cmd` function. For example, when `run_hive_cmd` returns an error or does not return anything, the `table_exists` function assumes that the table does not exist, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, a better approach would be to handle all the possible outcomes of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, the way `partition_spec` is called should also be verified, as it seems to be part of the bug.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            partition_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition ({3}='{4}')""".format(
                database, database, table, partition_output[0], partition_output[1]))

            return any(partition in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

In the corrected version, the output from `run_hive_cmd` is split into lines, and we look for the table or partition in each line, instead of just the entire output.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
