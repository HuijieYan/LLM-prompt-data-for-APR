## Corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, partition))
        return bool(stdout)
```

### Analysis of the buggy function:
The function is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database with optional partition information. The bug lies in the incorrect usage of the `show tables` and `show partitions` commands.

### Potential error locations:
1.  Incorrect `show tables` command in the first conditional statement.
2. Incorrect `show partitions` command in the else conditional statement.
3. Inconsistent usage of string formatting.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by not providing the correct syntax for the `show tables` and `show partitions` commands, as well as the incorrect usage of string formatting.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the syntax of the `show tables` and `show partitions` commands.
2. Use consistent string formatting to ensure correct substitution of variables.

### Fixed version of the function:
I have provided a corrected version of the function based on the identified issues:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, partition))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, I have fixed the syntax of the `show tables` and `show partitions` commands, as well as used consistent string formatting for better readability and correctness.
