The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test as a result of case sensitivity issues when comparing table names retrieved from the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

To fix this bug:
- We need to modify both the `table_exists` function and the `run_hive_cmd` function by converting all table names to lowercase before any comparisons are made.

- Additionally, the fix should also address the case insensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issues by ensuring the comparison is not case sensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import re

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                   (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function will now convert both the table name being checked and the names retrieved from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase, thereby making the comparisons case insensitive and resolving the issue reported in the GitHub issues.
