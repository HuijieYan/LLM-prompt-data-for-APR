## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
There are potential error locations in the `table_exists` function where the comparison between the table name and the stdout is not case insensitive.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the `table_exists` function does not perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout obtained from the Hive command. This causes failures when checking for existing tables with differently-cased names.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison in the `table_exists` function needs to be made case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```
