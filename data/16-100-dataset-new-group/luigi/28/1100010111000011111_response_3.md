## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from the command to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. This resolves the issue mentioned in GitHub and makes the `table_exists` function more robust.
