To fix the buggy function, we need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting the table name in the `stdout` to lowercase and comparing it with the lowercase version of the input table name. 

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will treat the table name case-insensitively and pass the failing tests. This solution also aligns with the GitHub issue that was opened to address the case insensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
