The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be related to the conditionals and the way it checks the existence of a table or partition. 

In the first conditional, the function checks if the `partition` parameter is None, and if so, runs a hive command to check if the table exists in the specified database and returns True if it does.

In the second conditional, if there is a `partition` parameter, it runs a different hive command to show the partitions and then returns True if there is any output.

The bug in the first conditional is that it incorrectly checks for the presence of the table in the output of the hive command. It should be checking for the presence of the full table name, but instead only checks if the table name is in the output, so it returns True for any table name that partially matches.

In the second conditional, the bug appears to be the same issue, where it checks if there is any output at all and returns True, even if the table does not exist.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditionals to check for the exact table name in the output of the hive command and to return False if the output is not as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

With this correction, the function checks if the table name (or partition) is exactly equal to the output of the hive command, and it also correctly handles the case when there is no output by returning False.
