The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The `table_exists` function should be case insensitive as Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lowercase, leading to test failures for tables with capitalized names.

The `table_exists` function should check for the lowercase version of the table name in the stdout to ensure case insensitivity.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the condition where the function checks if the `table` is present in the `stdout` by converting both table and stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Check for lowercase version of table in the lowercase stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in the Hive database, as discussed in the GitHub issues.
