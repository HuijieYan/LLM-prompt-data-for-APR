The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive and may fail when checking for existing tables due to case sensitivity. This bug was reported in a GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and was later addressed in "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".

The main cause of the bug lies in the comparison of the table name with the output of the Hive query, which is case sensitive. This can lead to false negatives, where the function incorrectly reports that a table does not exist. 

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output of the Hive query to lowercase before the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions from the same class are not shown here
    # ...

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive query is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the function behaves as expected and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
