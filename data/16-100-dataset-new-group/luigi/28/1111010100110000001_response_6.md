The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `hive.py` file seems to have an issue. Based on the error messages from the failing tests, it appears that the function is not returning the correct values when checking if a table exists in the given database.

The potential error locations within the `table_exists` function are:
1. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` might not be evaluating correctly.
2. The stdout from running the Hive command to check the existence of the table might not be parsed correctly.
3. The logic for returning `True` or `False` based on stdout content seems to be incorrect.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the way the stdout from the Hive commands is being handled. The incomplete or malformed stdout parsing logic seems to be leading to incorrect evaluations of whether the table exists or not.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to take the correct actions based on the output of the Hive command, and the parsing of the stdout should be handled properly. The function should check if a table exists in the given database by running appropriate Hive commands and returning `True` if the table is found in the output, otherwise returning `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')

        return "OK" in stdout  # Check if "OK" is in the output
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

        return "OK" in stdout  # Check if "OK" is in the output
```

In this corrected version, the stdout is checked for the presence of "OK" to determine if the table exists. This should ensure that the function returns the correct values to pass the failing test cases.
