## Buggy Function
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database. However, it is returning incorrect results.

The potential errors in the function:
1. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` is not reliable for checking table existence.
2. The usage of `self.partition_spec(partition)` seems to be incorrect.

The cause of the bug:
The condition `stdout and table in stdout` does not provide a reliable check for table existence. Additionally, the usage of `self.partition_spec(partition)` might not be constructing the expected partition specification.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a more reliable method to check for table existence.
2. Review the usage of `self.partition_spec(partition)` to ensure it constructs the correct partition specification.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, 
                                                                                        self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
