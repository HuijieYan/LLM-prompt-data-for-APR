The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it fails to handle case sensitivity when checking for existing tables in the database. This leads to failed test cases and a GitHub issue discussing the problem and suggesting a solution.

The bug occurs when the function compares the table name with the table names returned from the database without considering case sensitivity. This causes the function to incorrectly identify the existence of the table.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the table names in the database should be made case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the fixed version, both the table name and the table names in the database are converted to lower case before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive match.

This corrected version will pass the failing test and fulfill the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
