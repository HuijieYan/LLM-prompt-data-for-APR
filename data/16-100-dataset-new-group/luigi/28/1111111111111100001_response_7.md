The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the logic inside the `table_exists` function. The function is checking whether a table exists in the database by running a Hive command and then searching for the table name in the output. 

The bug appears to be in how the function processes the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It is not handling the case where the table exists correctly, leading to incorrect boolean values being returned.

The bug is likely caused by the logic in the `table_exists` function not correctly parsing the output from the Hive command to determine if the table exists or not.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to correctly parse the output from the Hive command and return the correct boolean value based on whether the table exists or not.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the output and checking for the table name in the `stdout`, the corrected function should now return the correct boolean value based on whether the table exists or not. This should fix the bug and make the provided test cases pass.
