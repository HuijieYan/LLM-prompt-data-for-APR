The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This is confirmed by the GitHub issue, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The bug occurs when the function checks for the existence of a table using the `run_hive_cmd` function and then compares the table name to the output. The issue stems from the fact that Hive is case insensitive, so the table name may be returned in lowercase even if it is provided in uppercase or a different case.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase and then check if it exists in the stdout also converted to lowercase. This will address the case sensitivity issue and make the function "case insensitive" as suggested in the GitHub issue.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This will ensure that the function is case insensitive and will address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
