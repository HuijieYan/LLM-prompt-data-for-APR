The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` is case-sensitive. This leads to test failures when the case of the table name does not match the case of the table name returned in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `stdout`. This will make the comparison case-insensitive, resolving the issue that was reported in GitHub (issue #896).

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison of `table` and `stdout` case-insensitive, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue reported in GitHub about making `table_exists` case insensitive.
