To fix the bug, let's update the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
The main issue in the original code is the incorrect handling of the `stdout` and incorrect condition checks. The original buggy function did not split the output before checking for a table name, and the conditions always returned an incorrect boolean value.

In the corrected version, the `stdout` is split by newline character to check if the table name is present. For the case when `partition` is not None, only the presence of `stdout` is checked, returning a Boolean value.

The corrected `table_exists` method should now pass the failing tests.
