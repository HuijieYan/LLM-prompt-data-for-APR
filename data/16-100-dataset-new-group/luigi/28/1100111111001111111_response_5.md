To fix the bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to make it case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version compares the lowercased table name with the lowercased stdout, making it case insensitive as described in the GitHub issue. With this change, the table_exists function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it addresses the issue raised on GitHub, making the function case insensitive and handling tables with different capitalizations effectively.
