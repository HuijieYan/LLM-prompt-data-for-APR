To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the `stdout` case insensitive. Currently, the buggy function does a direct comparison between the table name and the `stdout`, which can cause failures when the case of the table name and the tables listed in `stdout` don't match.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_lower = table.lower()
        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we convert the table name to lowercase using `table_lower = table.lower()` and then compare `table_lower` and `stdout` in a case-insensitive manner using `table_lower in stdout.lower()`.

This approach should fix the issue reported in GitHub and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, resolving the failing tests.
