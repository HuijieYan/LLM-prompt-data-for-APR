## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class
The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a subclass of `HiveClient`. This class uses `hive` invocations to find information about tables and partitions in a database.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the `table_exists` function are:
1. Incorrect logic for checking if the table exists or not.
2. Incorrect formatting of the `stdout` variable assignments.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the database. Additionally, the formatting of the `stdout` variable assignments is not consistent and could lead to unexpected behavior.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
1. The logic for checking if the table exists or not needs to be fixed using the correct hive commands.
2. The formatting of the `stdout` variable assignments should be standardized for better readability and maintainability.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if not partition:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `show tables` command is corrected to check for the existence of table 'table' in the 'database'.
2. The `stdout` variable assignments are using consistent formatting and appropriate command syntax.
3. For the case where the partition is not None, the `stdout` is converted to a boolean value for clarity in the return statement.
