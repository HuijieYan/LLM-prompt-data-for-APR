To fix the buggy function, we need to address the issue with case sensitivity that was highlighted in the GitHub issue. 

The current implementation fails to account for case insensitivity when checking for an existing table in the database. 

We'll modify the `table_exists` function to ensure that it is case insensitive when comparing table names. 

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the function will now compare table names in a case insensitive manner. This change addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussion and ensures that the function will pass the failing test cases.
