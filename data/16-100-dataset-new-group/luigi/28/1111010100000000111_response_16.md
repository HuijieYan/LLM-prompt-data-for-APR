# The buggy function table_exists in the HiveCommandClient class is not case insensitive, causing issues when checking for existing tables that are defined in capitalized form. This is primarily caused by the comparison of table and stdout not taking into account case sensitivity.

# To fix the bug, we should modify the table_exists function to make it case insensitive by converting both table and stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

# The corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
