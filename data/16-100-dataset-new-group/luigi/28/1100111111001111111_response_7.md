The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This is causing the failing tests, as the tests are providing table names with different cases than what is returned from the Hive database.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by checking `table.lower()` in the `stdout` returned from the Hive commands.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, before comparing `table` in `stdout`, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower` method. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the failing tests and fixing the bug.

This corrected version is aligned with the GitHub issues #896 and the provided test cases.
