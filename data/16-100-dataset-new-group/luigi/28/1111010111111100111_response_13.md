The buggy function `table_exists` has two main issues. The first issue is with the condition in the `else` block, where `run_hive_cmd` is called with incorrect parameters. The second issue is with the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.

In the failing test, the first assertion fails because the output of `table_exists("mytable")` is False instead of True. This happens because the table name is not found in the `stdout`.

The first step to fix the bug is to correct the condition in the `else` block of the `table_exists` function. The `run_hive_cmd` call should be made with the correct parameters to search for partitions.

The second step is to make the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` case insensitive to address the issue #896 on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function based on the identified issues:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split("\n"))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
            return partition and self.partition_spec(partition) in map(str.lower, stdout.split("\n"))
```

This version of the function addresses the issues found in the original buggy function. The comparison between the table name and the `stdout` is now case insensitive, and the `run_hive_cmd` calls have been corrected to search for partitions correctly.
