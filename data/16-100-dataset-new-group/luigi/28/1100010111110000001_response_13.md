The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely caused by the condition to return `stdout` and the table being in `stdout` when no partition is provided. It appears that the logic checks whether `stdout` is not an empty string in this case. However, the logic itself seems to be inverted, as it should return `True` if the table is in `stdout`, and `False` otherwise.

To fix the bug, the logic for returning `stdout and table in stdout` should be adjusted to return `True` if the table is in `stdout`, and `False` otherwise.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By fixing the logic in the `table_exists` function, it should now correctly return `True` if the table is in `stdout` and `False` otherwise, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test cases to pass.
