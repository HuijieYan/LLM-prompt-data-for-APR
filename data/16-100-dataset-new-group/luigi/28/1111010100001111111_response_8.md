Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issues, it is clear that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function does not handle case sensitivity in the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the stdout, leading to test failures when the table names are in different cases.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the tables listed in the stdout, making it case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now compares the lowercase versions of the table name and the tables listed in the stdout, making the comparison case insensitive. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and satisfies the expected input/output values for the test cases.
