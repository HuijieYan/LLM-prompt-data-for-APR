The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be related to how the returned value of `stdout` is being processed. In the first part of the function, the code checks if the `stdout` contains the `table` name, but it does not consider the case where the table name is part of a larger string.

The bug also seems to be related to how the `partition` parameter is being handled. In the code for the `else` block, the `run_hive_cmd` appears to be missing an argument, which may affect how the `stdout` is returned and processed.

In addition, there is a missing method or logical error related to the `self.partition_spec` attribute when the `partition` parameter is not None.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that we correctly process the returned `stdout` to determine if the table exists. We also need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is properly executed with the correct arguments, and that the `self.partition_spec` method is appropriately used.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we split the `stdout` by newlines and then check if the table name is present in the list of tables. We also make sure to pass the correct arguments to the `run_hive_cmd` function. Finally, we return `True` or `False` based on the presence of `stdout`.
