### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly. When checking if a table exists, it compares the table name in a case-sensitive manner. However, Hive is case-insensitive, and the table names returned from Hive are in lowercase. This causes the comparison to fail when the table name is not in lowercase format.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase and then perform the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function uses the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change makes the comparison case-insensitive, resolving the issue reported.
