The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing the test cases to fail when checking for table existence. The issue posted on GitHub also confirms this, suggesting that the function should be made case-insensitive by checking `stdout` against the lowercase version of the table name.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified such that it checks for table existence in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from `run_hive_cmd`, making it case-insensitive. This correction will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the test cases pass as expected.
