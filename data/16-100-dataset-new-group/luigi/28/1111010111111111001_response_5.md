The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty, and `table` is in `stdout`. But for the second case, it should check if `table` is in a line of `stdout`, not the entire `stdout`.

We will fix the bug by splitting the `stdout` into lines and checking if `table` is in any of the lines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version uses the `split` method on `stdout` to divide it into lines and then checks if `table` is in any of the lines. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
