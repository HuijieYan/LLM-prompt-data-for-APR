The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it does not handle partitioned tables correctly. The function is checking if the `stdout` variable is empty to determine if a partitioned table exists, but it should be checking for the specific partition instead.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the part of the code that handles partitioned tables. The corrected function should conditionally construct the Hive command based on whether a partition is provided, and then check if the command output contains the specific partition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other class functions

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            query = """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, ' and '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()]))
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
    
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle partitioned tables and return the correct results for the given test cases.
