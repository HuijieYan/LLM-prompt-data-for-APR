## Fixes

Analysis:
The error message states that the test case of `self.assertTrue(returned)` fails. This is in the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` functions. This suggests that the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class returns a value that is not as expected. 

Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be because the `table_exists` function does not correctly process the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It also returns the opposite boolean value in the regular case and the 'else' case which will cause issues. 

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the logic inside the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and return True for the correct cases.
2. Ensure that the function consistently returns the expected boolean values for the different scenarios.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected function should consistently return the expected boolean values for the different test scenarios and pass both the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` functions.
