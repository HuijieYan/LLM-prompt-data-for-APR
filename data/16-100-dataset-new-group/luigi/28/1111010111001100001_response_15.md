The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class. The purpose of this function is to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function takes in the table name, database, and an optional partition, and then uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check if the table exists.

After analyzing the failing test cases, it is evident that the function is not handling the stdout (standard output) from the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly. In some cases, the function should return `True` if the table exists, but it is currently returning `False` due to mishandling of the stdout.

The bug is causing the `table_exists` function to return incorrect values for some test cases. The bug is likely due to how the function is processing the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In particular, the condition for checking if `stdout` is not empty is problematic. Additionally, the function does not utilize the `partition` parameter correctly when checking for the existence of partitioned tables.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes the stdout and implement the correct handling of the `partition` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In this corrected version, we use the `.split('\n')` method to check if the table exists in the stdout for non-partitioned tables. For partitioned tables, we use the `.strip() != ""` method to determine if the stdout is not empty.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
