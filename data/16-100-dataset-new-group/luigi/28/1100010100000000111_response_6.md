Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison between the table name and stdout is case sensitive, causing issues when the table name is not in the same case as the output from the Hive command.

Cause of the bug:
The bug causes the table_exists function to fail when checking for an existing table that is defined in capitalized letters. Because Hive is case insensitive, the function fails to properly check for the existence of the table.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout needs to be made case insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
