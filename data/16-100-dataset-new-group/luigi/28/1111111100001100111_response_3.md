Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive CLI. The bug occurs when the table name has different cases in the `table_exists` function and the actual table name in Hive.

To fix the bug, the table name should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive CLI. This will make the comparison case insensitive and address the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the table name is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before checking if it exists in the output from the Hive CLI. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
