The bug in the provided function is that the `table_exists` function is not returning the correct result based on the `stdout` value. It is currently returning `stdout and table in stdout`, which may not be reliable in all cases.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the function to explicitly check for the existence of the table based on the `stdout` value. We can modify the function to return a boolean value based on whether the table is found in the `stdout` output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty, otherwise False
```

This version explicitly checks for the existence of the table in the `stdout` output and returns a boolean value accordingly.
