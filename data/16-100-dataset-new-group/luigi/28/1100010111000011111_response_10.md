The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. When comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command, it does not account for case differences, which causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase using the `lower()` method, we can ensure that the comparison is case insensitive. This modifies the behavior to check if the lowercase table name is present in the lowercase stdout, regardless of case differences.

With this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and also satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it addresses the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
