To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the table_exists function correctly checks for the existence of a table in the database. Based on the error messages and the failing test cases, it seems that the function is not handling the case-insensitive nature of table names in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we use string manipulation to ensure case-insensitive comparison of table names. For the show tables command, we split the output by line and check if any table matches the expected table name, ignoring the case. For the show partitions command, we simply return whether stdout has any content.

This corrected function should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
