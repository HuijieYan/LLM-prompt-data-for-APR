The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the tests to fail. The issue appears to be related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

The buggy function has two main issues:
1. In the first condition, it checks if the table name is in the `stdout` variable. However, the comparison is case-sensitive, which leads to incorrect results.
2. In the second condition, it directly checks if `stdout` has a value to determine if the table exists. This can also lead to incorrect results due to case sensitivity issues.

To fix these issues:
1. Convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.
2. Use the `in` keyword to check if the table name exists in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This implementation addresses the case sensitivity issues and uses the `in` keyword to check if the table name exists in the `stdout`, thus resolving the failing test cases and the GitHub issues.
