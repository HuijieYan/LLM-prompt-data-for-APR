The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists in the database. This is causing issues when comparing table names with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which returns table names in lowercase.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With these changes, the function will now be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the database. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub, and the function should work as expected.
