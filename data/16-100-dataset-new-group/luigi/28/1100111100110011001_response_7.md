The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to originate from the conditional statements. Currently, the function is not correctly handling the case when the `run_hive_cmd` returns a string with the table name. The function does not properly check if the table exists in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix this, we need to modify the condition to check if the table name is present in the output of `run_hive_cmd` when a specific table and database are provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and len(stdout.strip().split('\n')) > 1
```

This corrected version includes the necessary condition to check if the table name is present in the output of `run_hive_cmd` when a specific table and database are provided. It also accounts for the case where `run_hive_cmd` returns multiple lines of output for partitioned tables.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
