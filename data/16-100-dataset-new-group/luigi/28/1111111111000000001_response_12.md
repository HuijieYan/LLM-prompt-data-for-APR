The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not returning the correct output for the given input in the test cases. The problem seems to be in the conditional statements inside `table_exists` that check if the table exists in the database or if a specific partition exists.

The bug occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with the wrong arguments, and the conditional checks for the output are not correct.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to call `run_hive_cmd` with the correct arguments based on whether a partition is specified or not. Then, we need to correctly check the output of `run_hive_cmd` to determine if the table or partition exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the modification, we correctly call `run_hive_cmd` with the appropriate SQL command for checking the existence of the table or partition. Then, we return `True` if the output is not an empty string, indicating that the table or partition exists.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test case provided.
