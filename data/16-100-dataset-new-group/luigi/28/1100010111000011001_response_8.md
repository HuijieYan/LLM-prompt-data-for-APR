The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to how the `stdout` variable is being used to check if a table or partition exists in a database. The `stdout` variable is being checked for truthiness, but this may not be a reliable indicator of whether the table or partition exists. Additionally, the condition in the else block is not handling the check correctly.

To fix the bug, we should explicitly check the presence of the table or partition in the `stdout` variable before returning. We can also simplify the conditional statements for better readability.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if the `table` or `partition` is in the `stdout` variable before returning, and we use `bool(stdout)` to check if `stdout` is not empty. This should fix the bug and make the function pass all the test cases.
