The bug in the provided function is that the condition for checking the existence of a table or partition is not effectively checking the output of the hive command for the presence of the table/partition. Instead, it's returning whether the output string is empty or not.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to explicitly check if the table/partition name is in the stdout, rather than just checking if the stdout is empty or not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout
```

In this corrected version, the function now explicitly checks whether the table/partition name exists in the stdout, rather than relying on the truthiness of stdout itself.
