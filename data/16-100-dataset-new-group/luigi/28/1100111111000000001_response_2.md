The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be in the logic that checks the presence of a table in the Hive database, as evident from the failing test cases.

The problem arises from the comparison of the table name in the command output. The function `run_hive_cmd` returns the output with the table name and some additional content. The buggy function needs to extract only the table name from the output and compare it with the expected table name.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to extract the table name from the command output and compare it with the expected table name.
2. Update the logic to handle both cases when the table does and does not exist.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By updating the `table_exists` function as shown above, it should fix the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
