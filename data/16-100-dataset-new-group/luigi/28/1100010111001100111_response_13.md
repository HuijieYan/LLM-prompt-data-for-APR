The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists, leading to test failures for tables with different cases. The GitHub issue #896 also addresses this problem, suggesting that the function should be case insensitive and check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, the `table_exists` function should be modified to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the function will now be case insensitive when checking for table existence. This change should fix the failing tests, resolve the issue posted in GitHub, and align with the expected behavior for table existence checks.
