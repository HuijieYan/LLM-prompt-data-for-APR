The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is causing issues with the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. The error message from the failing test indicates that the returned value is not as expected, leading to failed assertions. The GitHub issue also confirms the problem, suggesting that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not consider the case of the table name when checking for its existence. This leads to mismatches between the expected and actual table names returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function will compare the lowercase table name with the lowercase output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive and addressing the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub.
