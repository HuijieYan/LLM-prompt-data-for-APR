The buggy function `table_exists` is not returning the correct output. The issue arises from the incorrect implementation of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the formatting errors in containing the command to be executed by the Hive. It needs to interact with the actual Hive instance to query the existence of a table properly.

The cause of the bug is that the `stdout` may not be formatted correctly from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to an incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists or not. Additionally, the commands to interact with Hive are not properly structured, leading to incorrect results.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the correct output and to structure the Hive query commands properly using the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected version for the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # ... (other class functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('USE {0}; SHOW TABLES IN {1} LIKE "{2}";'.format(database, database, table), check_return_code=False)
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_condition = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'USE {database}; SHOW PARTITIONS {table} PARTITION ({partition_condition});', check_return_code=False)
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:

1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is now being properly called with the formatted Hive query commands.
2. In the case of checking if the table exists with a partition, the `SHOW PARTITIONS` command is being correctly constructed to include the `partition_condition`.
3. The obtained `stdout` is checked for whether the table or partitions exist using boolean evaluations.
4. The `check_return_code` parameter is used to avoid raising an exception when an error is encountered. The function should handle error scenarios gracefully.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
