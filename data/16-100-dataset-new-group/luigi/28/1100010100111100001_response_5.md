The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it always returns the opposite of what is expected due to incorrect logic. The function is supposed to return `True` if the table exists, and `False` if the table does not exist. However, in the current implementation, it returns `True` if the command output is not empty and `False` if the command output is empty.

To fix the bug, we should change the following code:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
to
```python
return table in stdout
```
and
```python
if stdout:
    return True
else:
    return False
```
to
```python
return False
```

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return False
```
