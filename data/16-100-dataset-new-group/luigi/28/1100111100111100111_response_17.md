Based on the input and output values provided and the related GitHub issues, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive. The issue on GitHub (#896) suggests that the function should be case insensitive and check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues. 

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to modify the comparison to make it case insensitive. It should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the contents in `stdout` to perform a case insensitive check for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive, the corrected `table_exists` function will now properly handle the case where the table name is in different cases and pass the failing test cases.
