### Bug Location and Explanation
The bug seems to be related to the table_exists function in the HiveCommandClient class of the file luigi/contrib/hive.py. The failing tests indicate that the table_exists function is not handling case insensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The GitHub issues #896 and #893 also confirm that the table_exists function needs to be case insensitive.

The issue arises when table names are defined in a different case (e.g., capitalized) than what is returned by Hive (e.g., lower case). This leads to the test failing and the function not behaving as intended.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to make it case insensitive. This means that when comparing the table name against the output from Hive, we should convert both to the same case (e.g., lower case) for accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- The table name is converted to lower case before being used in the Hive queries.
- The output from Hive is also converted to lower case before the comparison.
- `return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()` checks if the lowercased table name is present in the lowercased stdout.

These changes ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
