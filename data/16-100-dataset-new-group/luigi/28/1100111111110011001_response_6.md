To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The bug is likely in the conditional logic for checking if the table exists and the command being run to check for the table's existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = " and ".join(['{} = "{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
1. We have added a new line to create a `partition_str` that represents the partition in the `else` block. This is used to construct the correct command for checking the existence of the table with the given partition.
2. We updated the `run_hive_cmd` command in the `else` block to use the `partition_str` to check if the partition exists.
3. We simplified the conditional logic for returning True or False based on the `stdout` value in the `else` block.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
