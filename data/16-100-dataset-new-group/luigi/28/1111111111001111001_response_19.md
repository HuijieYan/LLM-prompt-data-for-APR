The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be caused by the conditional statements inside the function. The first conditional statement is checking if `partition` is None, and if so, it runs a hive command to check if the table exists. The second conditional statement runs a hive command to check for the existence of a partition if the `partition` parameter is not None. 

The bug seems to be related to the processing of the `partition` parameter. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling the partition parameter correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the partition parameter in the `table_exists` function to ensure that the correct hive command is executed based on the presence or absence of the partition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ' and '.join([f'{k}="{v}"' for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
In the fixed version, the `partition` parameter is properly handled to construct the partition query string, and the correct hive command is executed based on the presence of the partition. This should address the issues observed in the failing test cases.
