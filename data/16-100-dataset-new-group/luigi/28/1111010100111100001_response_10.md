The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the comparison of the `stdout` variable. The function should return `True` if the `table` is found in `stdout`, but currently it returns `False` when `stdout` is not empty.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the table name is not found in the `stdout` properly. Instead of checking if `table in stdout` and returning that value, the function directly returns `stdout and table in stdout`, which is incorrect because an empty string evaluates to `False` and, therefore, the function can return `False` even if the table is actually found.

To fix the bug, we will change the logic in the function to explicitly check for the presence of the table in the `stdout` and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
