The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing tests and the respective error messages. The issue on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive while checking for table existence.

The bug seems to be originating from the fact that the `table_exists` function does not perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this modification, the function will now perform case-insensitive checks for table existence, thereby resolving the issue reported on GitHub. The corrected function should pass the failing tests and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive as requested.
