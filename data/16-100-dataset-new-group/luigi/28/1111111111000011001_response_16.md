The issue in the `table_exists` function is that when a partition is provided, the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called correctly to check for the existence of the table.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for when a partition is provided. We should call `run_hive_cmd` with the correct command to check if the partition exists.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_filter = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_filter))
        return bool(stdout)
```

The modified version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
