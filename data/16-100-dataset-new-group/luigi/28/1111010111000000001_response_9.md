To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to address the logic for checking if a table exists in the `table_exists` function. Currently, it has conditional statements that check the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and return `True` or `False` based on the presence of the table in the output. However, the implementation is incorrect, as it does not account for the expected output format of the `run_hive_cmd`.

The following is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            partition_filter = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_filter});')
            return any(partition_filter in part for part in stdout.split('\n'))
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is used with the appropriate HiveQL queries to check for the existence of the table and its partitions.
2. The `stdout` is split by newlines and checked if the table or partition exists in the output.

With the corrected version of the function, it should pass the failing test in the provided test files.
