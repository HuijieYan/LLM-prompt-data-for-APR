The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes issues when the table names in the database are in a different case from the one checked by the function. The bug has been reported on GitHub, and the suggested fix is to make the comparison case insensitive by using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # No need for an if-else statement
    
```

In the corrected version, the comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` ensures that the existence of the table is checked in a case-insensitive manner. The unnecessary if-else statement has been replaced by a simple `return bool(stdout)`. These changes address the issue reported on GitHub and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
