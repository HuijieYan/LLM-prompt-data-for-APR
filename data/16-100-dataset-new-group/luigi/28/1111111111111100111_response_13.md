The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it is not handling case sensitivity properly, causing the test cases to fail. The issue on GitHub points out that the function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

The bug is occurring because the `table_exists` function compares the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function should be made case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version converts both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case insensitive. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function pass the failing test cases.
