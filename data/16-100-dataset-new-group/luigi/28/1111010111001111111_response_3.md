The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` method is case-sensitive, causing it to fail when checking for tables with names in different capitalization formats. The issue was identified in the GitHub issue "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive", which describes the need to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `stdout` needs to be converted to lowercase before comparing it to the lowercase `table` string to make the comparison case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).lower()
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).lower()
            return table.lower() in stdout
```
This corrected version ensures that the `stdout` result is transformed to lowercase before comparison with the lowercase `table` value, allowing for a case-insensitive comparison.

With this correction, the `table_exists` method should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted on GitHub by implementing a case-insensitive comparison for table existence.
