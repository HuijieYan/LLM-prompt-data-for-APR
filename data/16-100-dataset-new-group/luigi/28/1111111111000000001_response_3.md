The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way the `stdout` variable is checked to determine if the table exists or not. The function returns the table name if it exists, which is then checked directly by the `table_exists` function. However, the test cases show that the function is expecting "OK\nmytable" rather than just "mytable" to indicate that the table exists. 

To fix this, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to correctly parse the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function and handle the cases where the table does not exist.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_args = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_args))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, for the case where the table of interest does not have a partition, we use the `show tables` command and check for the exact match with the table name. For the case where a partition is specified, we construct the partition clause and use the `show partitions` command to verify the existence of the table with the specified partition.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
