The bug in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `hive.py` file is caused by the comparison of table names without considering the cases. The `table_exists` function is intended to check for the existence of a table in a Hive database, and the comparison is case-sensitive, which leads to test failures.

To fix the bug, the table name should be converted to lower case before comparing it with the output obtained from Hive. This will make the comparison case-insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the `table` parameter and the output `stdout` are both converted to lower case before performing the comparison, ensuring that the function is now case-insensitive. This change addresses the failing test cases and also aligns with the suggestions in the GitHub issue.
