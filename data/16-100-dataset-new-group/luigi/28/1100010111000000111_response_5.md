To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of tables irrespective of their case.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` name and `stdout` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. This addresses the issue raised in the GitHub ticket (#896) and makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
