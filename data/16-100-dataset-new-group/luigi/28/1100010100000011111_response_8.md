## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it doesn't account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. This causes issues when table names are in different cases than the expected input.

To fix this bug, the corrected version of the function uses the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, and then checks if the table name exists in the stdout. This makes the function case insensitive and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub.
