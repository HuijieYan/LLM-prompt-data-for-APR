The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the logic of checking whether a table exists in the specified database in Hive.

The buggy function seems to have two main issues:
1. In the first part of the function, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is likely not evaluating as expected. The `stdout` variable might not be processed correctly in this condition.
2. In the second part of the function, the `stdout` variable is being checked for truthiness, but it is not being used to determine if the table exists.

To fix the bug, we can use the `stdout` variable correctly in both parts of the conditional blocks and ensure that the conditions are evaluating as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout is not None and len(stdout) > 0
```
