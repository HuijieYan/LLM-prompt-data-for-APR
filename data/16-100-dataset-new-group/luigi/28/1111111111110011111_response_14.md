The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it fails to handle case insensitivity for table names in Hive. The expected behavior is that the function should return `True` when the table exists, regardless of the case of the table name. A failing test case asserts this behavior.

The bug seems to be located in the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` against the given table name. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should also be case insensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison in the `table_exists` function is case sensitive, resulting in failures when the table exists but with a different case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison inside the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            return bool(stdout)  # No need for separate if-else condition here
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub about making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
