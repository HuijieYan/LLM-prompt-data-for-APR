The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. This issue has been reported in GitHub and it is suggested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The bug is causing the failing tests to return incorrect results when checking for the existence of tables in Hive due to case sensitivity issues.

The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison, effectively making the function case insensitive.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issues reported on GitHub. The function now performs a case insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout, ensuring that it returns the correct result regardless of case.
