The buggy function `table_exists` provided has a bug in line 15, where the comparison is case-sensitive, causing the test to fail for case-insensitive table names.

The cause of the bug is identified as the comparison between `table` and `stdout` without converting both to the same case (lower or upper). The GitHub issue #896 also confirms that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between `table` and `stdout` by converting both to the same case, either lower or upper case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrections made include converting both `table` and `stdout` to the same case using `lower()` method which resolves the case insensitivity issue as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values and also fix the issue reported in GitHub.
