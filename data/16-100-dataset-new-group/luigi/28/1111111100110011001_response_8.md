Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the comparison of the `stdout` variable and the expected table value. The function is not correctly parsing the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists.

The bug is likely caused by the `run_hive_cmd` function returning both the status and the table name in the same variable, and the `table_exists` function not handling this format properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to correctly parse the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and compare it with the expected table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by directly checking if the expected table name is present in the `stdout` variable returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function, without relying on a boolean evaluation. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result for the given test cases.
