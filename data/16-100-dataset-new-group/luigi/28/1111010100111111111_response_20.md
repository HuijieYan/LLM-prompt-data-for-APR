The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly handling the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive database, which is causing the failing tests. The tests are failing when checking for the existence of a table due to case mismatches and the function not being case insensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name directly with the output of the Hive command, which is case sensitive. The tests pass when the table name case matches the output case, but fail when they don't match.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them, making it case insensitive.

In addition, the GitHub issue related to the bug suggests making `table_exists` case insensitive to fix the problem identified in the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the function which handles case insensitivity:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
With this updated function that converts both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase, the failing tests should pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
