The bug in the `table_exists` function arises due to a case sensitivity issue. The `table_exists` function is comparing the table name without considering the case, leading to incorrect comparisons. This is evident from the GitHub issue, which discusses fixing the function to make it case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner as suggested in the GitHub issue.

To do this, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected `table_exists` function uses the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This modification ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass, and it aligns with the expected input/output values. The bug mentioned in the GitHub issues is also addressed through this fix.
