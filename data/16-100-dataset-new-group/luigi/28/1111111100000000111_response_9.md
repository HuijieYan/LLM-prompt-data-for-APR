The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The GitHub issue suggests that tables defined with capitalized names may not match with the lowercase output from Hive, causing the function to return false negatives.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function uses `table.lower()` to compare the table name with the output from Hive, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
