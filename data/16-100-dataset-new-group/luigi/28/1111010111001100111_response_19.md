The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This is causing the failure in the test cases mentioned. 

The GitHub issue #896 also confirms that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase and then do the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issues.
