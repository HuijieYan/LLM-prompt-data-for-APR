## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function is modified to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the data in stdout is done in a case-insensitive manner. This change addresses the GitHub issue and ensures that the function behaves as expected in all test cases.
