To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to correct the logic when checking the existence of a table in the Hive database.

The issue seems to be with the comparison of the `stdout` value to identify if the table exists or not. The current implementation does not handle the case where the table name is included in a newline-separated string.

We can fix the bug by updating the logic to split the `stdout` string by newline characters and then check if the table exists in the resulting list.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
With this updated implementation, we split the `stdout` by the newline character and check if the `table` exists in the resulting list. We also simplify the logic for the partition case to directly return a boolean value based on the presence of `stdout`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
