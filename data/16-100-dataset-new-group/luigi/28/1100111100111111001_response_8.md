The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the database when a partition is provided. This is causing the tests to fail because the function is returning the wrong value.

The `table_exists` function should return `True` if the table exists, and `False` if it does not. However, the buggy implementation is not correctly handling the partitioned tables.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `table_exists` function to properly handle the case when a partition is provided. This can be done by modifying the query to check for the existence of the table within the specified partition.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle partitioned tables and return the expected results for the failing tests.
