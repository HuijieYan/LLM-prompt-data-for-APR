The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity in the comparison of the table name. The failing test cases in GitHub issue #896 and the corresponding error messages indicate that the function is not handling case insensitivity properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we are using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issues reported in GitHub.
