The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional logic for checking if a table exists in the database, especially when checking case insensitivity.

The issue is that in the cases where the table exists, the function does not account for whether the table name is provided in a different case than what is returned from the query. It only checks for an exact match, leading to the test failures where the table exists but with a different case.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check for case insensitive matches when comparing the table names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions in the class...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version handles the case insensitivity issue by converting both the table name being checked and the table names returned from the query to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the check for table existence is case insensitive.
