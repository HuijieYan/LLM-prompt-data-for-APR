The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` method is case-sensitive, whereas Hive is insensitive to case. This causes the function to fail when checking for the existence of a table with a different case.


To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` method to convert the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the stdout result from the Hive command. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and fix the failing test cases.


Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        table_lower = table.lower()
        
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
            return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table_lower} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the method converts the table name to lowercase before running the Hive command to check for the table's existence. It also converts the stdout and the table name to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

This fix should address the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issues related to case-insensitivity in the `table_exists` method.
