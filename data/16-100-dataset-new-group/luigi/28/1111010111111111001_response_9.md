The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional statement. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not, but the code is inverted. Additionally, there is an issue with the condition that checks if a table exists with a specific partition. The `stdout` is being checked as a truthy value when it should be checked for content.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional statements to return `True` when the table exists and `False` when it does not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the function should now return the correct values for the given test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
