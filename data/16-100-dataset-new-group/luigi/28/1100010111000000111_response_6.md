The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` does not properly handle case sensitivity for table names when checking if a table exists in a Hive database. This issue is raised in GitHub issue #896 titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The problem is due to the fact that Hive is case insensitive when returning table names, while the `table_exists` function does not account for this case insensitivity.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lower case before checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided and resolve the case insensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
