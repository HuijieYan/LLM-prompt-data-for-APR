### Assertion Error:
Looking at the failing tests and input/output values provided, we can see that the test fails for the case where the table name is "MyTable" and the actual output is "OK\nmytable". This is an issue because the table name is not being checked in a case-insensitive manner.
Based on the GitHub issue, it is clear that the bug relates to case sensitivity issues when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The proposal in the GitHub issue is to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by checking the table name against the output in a case-insensitive manner.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to check the existence of the table in a case-insensitive way. This can be done by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the check.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` function, and then perform the existence check in a case-insensitive manner. This fix should resolve the failing tests and address the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issues.
