## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

            return True if table in stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return True if stdout else False
```

Explanation:
The buggy function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run hive commands and check for the existence of a table or partition. However, the buggy function contains two potential error locations:
1. using `show tables like` instead of `show tables in` in the first if condition.
2. incorrect string formatting and missing quotes in the else condition.

The cause of the bug is that the original function uses incorrect syntax in the hive commands, leading to incorrect results and potential errors.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Replace `show tables like` with `show tables in` in the first if condition.
2. Fix the string formatting and quotes in the else condition to ensure the correct hive command is executed.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and provides a more accurate and reliable way to check for the existence of a table or partition in Hive.
