The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database, but it is failing some test cases.

The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly checks the existence of a table when the partition is not None. The function constructs the command to run in Hive, but in the specific case for partitions, it doesn't correctly format the command. When run with a partition, the command should include the specific partition information, but this is not correctly handled in the original implementation.

To fix the bug, we need to construct the Hive command with the appropriate partition information and handle the output of the Hive command correctly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the partition specification is correctly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_string = ','.join(['%s=%s' % (k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_string});")
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function correctly constructs the Hive command with the specified partition information and handles the output of the Hive command. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
