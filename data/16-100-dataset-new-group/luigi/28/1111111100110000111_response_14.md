It appears that the function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity correctly. The failing test from GitHub issue #896 indicates that the function is not returning the expected results when checking for table existence using different case variations. The related GitHub issue and the failing test provide a clear understanding of the bug.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the comparison of the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when checking for table existence based on different case variations.

The cause of the bug is due to the comparison of the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd` not accounting for case sensitivity. This causes the function to return incorrect results when checking for table existence with different case variations, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases from GitHub issue #896.
