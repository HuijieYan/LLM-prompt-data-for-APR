The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists, which is causing the test to fail when it shouldn't. The issue is reported on GitHub as #896 and has been identified as a need to make `table_exists` case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
               ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )
        return bool(stdout)
```

This updated function ensures that the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
