The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database.

Based on the given GitHub issue, it is clear that tables in the Hive database are case insensitive, and the function is not handling this correctly, causing tests to fail when they shouldn't.

To fix the bug, I will modify the conditional statement in the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, I've used the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase, making the comparison case insensitive. This will ensure that the function works correctly with case insensitive table names in the Hive database.
