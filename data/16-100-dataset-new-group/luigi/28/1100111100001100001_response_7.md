Based on the runtime input/output variable values, the bug in the function `table_exists` arises from the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called and the conditional checks on the output `stdout`. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the formatting of the hive commands, especially when dealing with partitions.

The bug occurs when the function tries to call `run_hive_cmd` with a formatted string for the partition command. This seems to be causing issues with the command execution.

To fix the bug, the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with formatted strings for the commands should be reviewed. Additionally, the conditionals for checking the existence of the table or partition need to be reviewed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = '/'.join(['{}={}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the calls to `run_hive_cmd` have been adjusted to remove unnecessary double formatting, and the partition specification has been properly constructed and supplied to the command. The function now returns a boolean value directly from the result of `run_hive_cmd` for better clarity.
