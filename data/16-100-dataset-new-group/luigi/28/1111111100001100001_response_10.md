The bug in the function "table_exists" is that the "run_hive_cmd" function is not properly called with the correct input parameters. Additionally, the string formatting in the second "run_hive_cmd" call is incorrect, causing the function to produce incorrect results. 

A potential fix for this bug is to ensure that both calls to "run_hive_cmd" are properly formatted with the correct input parameters. Additionally, the "self.partition_spec" function call should be passed the "partition" parameter. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
