The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has the potential error location in the call to the `partition_spec` function. The function is trying to call `self.partition_spec(partition)` to get the partition specification, but it seems that there are multiple `partition_spec` function definitions in the same file, which can cause confusion and potentially lead to the wrong function being called.

The potential cause of the bug is the ambiguity in calling the `partition_spec` function due to the existence of multiple functions with the same name in the same file.

To fix the bug, we can explicitly specify the class of the `partition_spec` function that needs to be called. Also, to prevent any ambiguity, the `partition_spec` function can be renamed to `get_partition_spec` to provide a more descriptive function name.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def get_partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % 
                                    (database, table, self.get_partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `get_partition_spec` function is used instead of `partition_spec` to avoid ambiguity and potential errors in calling the correct function. Also, the formatting of the `stdout` variable has been modified for better readability.
