The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test. The function is checking if the table exists in the database with the given name and under the given partition. The problem is caused by the mismatch in the return values of `run_hive_cmd` function due to the way the query is formed.

The buggy function is not handling the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly, leading to incorrect results. The bug occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the string "OK" (without a newline character) followed immediately by the table name if the table exists. This causes the condition `table in stdout` to fail, even when the table exists. Additionally, the handling of the partition is also incorrect, resulting in a `False` return value regardless of whether the table exists under the given partition.

To fix the bug, the function should split and process the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly and handle the partition parameter. Using `partition_spec` function is also important to format the partition information properly for the Hive query.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return 'OK' in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2})""".format(database, table, partition_str))
    
            return 'OK' in stdout
```

In this corrected version, the function checks for the existence of the table by looking for the string "OK" in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. If the table exists, "OK" will be part of the output, and the function should return `True`. Additionally, the partition handling has been revised to use the formatted partition string obtained from the `partition_spec` function. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
