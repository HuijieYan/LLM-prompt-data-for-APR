The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive. The function is failing the test cases because it does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive.

Based on the provided GitHub issue information, the bug can be identified as not handling case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.

To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that it compares the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from the Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions defined within the class remain unchanged

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This change ensures that the function will work correctly in cases where the table names have different capitalization.
