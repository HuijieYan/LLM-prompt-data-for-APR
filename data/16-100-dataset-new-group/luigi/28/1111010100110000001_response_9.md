The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that it does not properly account for the condition where `stdout` contains `\n`, leading to incorrect evaluation of whether a table exists.

The cause of the bug is that the function is using the expression `table in stdout` to check for the existence of a table. However, when `stdout` contains an extra newline character, the condition will not be evaluated properly, leading to a false negative result.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to account for the presence of newline characters in `stdout` when checking for the existence of a table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.strip().split('\n')

        return any(t.strip() == table for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use `strip()` to remove leading and trailing whitespace and `split('\n')` to account for the presence of newline characters in `stdout`. Then, we check if the table exists by iterating through the tables and comparing each with the given table name. We also check for the presence of `stdout` directly in the partition check, simplifying the conditional expression to `return bool(stdout)`.
