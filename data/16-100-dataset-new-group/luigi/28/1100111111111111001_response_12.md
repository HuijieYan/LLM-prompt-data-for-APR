The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `stdout` variable and the input table name. It is failing to correctly check whether the table exists in the database.

The bug is likely due to the logic in the `table_exists` function, where it is not handling the case of multiple tables being returned in the `stdout` variable when checking for table existence.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the cases where multiple table names are returned in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2})".format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the updated `table_exists` function, we use the `split('\n')` method to split the `stdout` into individual table names and then check if the input table name exists in the list. For the case where a partition is specified, we construct the `partition_str` by joining the key-value pairs of the partition with `=` and `"`, and then use this in the `run_hive_cmd` function to check for the existence of the specific partition.

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now handle the cases of multiple tables in the output and correctly identify the existence of the specified table, and the failing tests should pass.
