The error message indicates that the buggy function is trying to determine the length of the 'columns' attribute, which is resulting in a TypeError because 'columns' is of type 'NoneType'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'copy' function to handle the case where 'columns' is None by providing a default behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns has a value
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we've added an additional check to ensure that 'self.columns' is not None before trying to determine its length. This prevents the TypeError that was occurring.
