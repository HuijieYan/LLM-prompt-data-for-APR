To fix the bug in the `copy()` function, we need to handle the case where `columns` is None. The current implementation tries to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it's not None, leading to a TypeError when `columns` is None.

We can address this issue by modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This way, we ensure that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy()` function will handle the case of `columns` being None, preventing the TypeError observed in the failing test.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
