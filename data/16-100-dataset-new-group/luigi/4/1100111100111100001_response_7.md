The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the comparison of the `self.columns` attribute with an empty list using `len()`. The `self.columns` attribute is set to `None` in the input `self` object, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not equal to `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, the `if` condition will pass, and the rest of the code will be skipped, eliminating the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
