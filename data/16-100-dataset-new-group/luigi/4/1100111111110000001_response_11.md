The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to a `TypeError`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is specifically testing the case when the `columns` attribute of the `S3CopyToTable` task is `None`. The error message indicates that the buggy function is trying to get the length of `self.columns` even when it's `None`, which causes a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` function. We can do this by adding a check for `None` before checking the length of `self.columns`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    # Check if self.columns is not None before attempting to get its length
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This should make the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` pass.
