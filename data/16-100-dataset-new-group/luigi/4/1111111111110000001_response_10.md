The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The purpose of this method is to define copying data from s3 into Redshift. The function attempts to construct a SQL `COPY` statement using attributes such as table name, column names, source, credentials, and options.

The failing test is `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` from the `redshift_test` module. The test creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` and calls its `run` method. Within this method, the `copy` function is called, and it fails due to a `TypeError` caused by attempting to find the length of a `NoneType` object (specifically, `self.columns`).

The cause of the bug is that the `copy` method does not handle the scenario where the `columns` attribute is `None`. When attempting to construct the `colnames` string, the `len` function is called on `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for the `None` value of `self.columns` before attempting to compute `colnames`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for self.columns not being None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, a check for `self.columns` to be defined and not None is added before applying the `len` function. This will prevent the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
