## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

## Explanation of the bug and its fix:

The issue in the original function is that it does not properly handle the case where `self.columns` is None. This causes a TypeError when trying to iterate over the columns to create the `colnames` string.

To fix this bug, the corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to iterate over it to create the `colnames` string. Additionally, it also checks for an empty list to ensure that the `colnames` string is used correctly in the `COPY` statement.

This fix ensures that the function can handle the case where `self.columns` is None, and it will not cause a TypeError when creating the `colnames` string.

With the corrected version, the test function provided should pass successfully.
