The bug in the provided code is that the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string, but the `COPY` statement in the SQL query is not handling the case where there are no column names to specify. This causes the SQL query to be invalid when `colnames` is empty, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `COPY` statement in the `cursor.execute` method to handle the case where `colnames` is empty. We can do this by checking if `colnames` is empty, and only including it in the `COPY` statement if it is not.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    colnames_clause = colnames if colnames else ''  # Include colnames only if it's not empty

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames_clause,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `colnames` variable will now only be included in the `COPY` statement if it is not empty, which should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
