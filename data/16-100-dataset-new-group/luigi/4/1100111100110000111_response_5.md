### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the buggy function `copy` is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is causing a `TypeError` because `self.columns` is `None`. This issue is related to the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".

### Bug Location:
The potential error location is identified at the following line in the buggy function:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the buggy function not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly. It is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it's `None`. This is in line with the GitHub issue's description.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This can be done with a simple `if` statement.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```
In the corrected version, the code first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
