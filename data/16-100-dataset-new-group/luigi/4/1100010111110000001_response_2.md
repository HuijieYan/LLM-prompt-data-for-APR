The bug in the `copy` function is related to the `columns` attribute being None, and the function does not handle this case properly. This results in an error when trying to get the length of None.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to process it.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before using its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is None without causing an error. The provided failing test should pass without any TypeError related to 'NoneType' issues.
