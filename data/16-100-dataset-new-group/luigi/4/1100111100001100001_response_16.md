The bug in the provided function is that the `copy_options` method is not being called to retrieve the options for the COPY command. This results in the options being empty, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, the `copy_options` method needs to be called to retrieve the correct options for the COPY command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call to retrieve the copy options
    )
```

By making the above change, the `copy_options` method will now be called to retrieve the correct options for the COPY command, and the bug will be fixed.
