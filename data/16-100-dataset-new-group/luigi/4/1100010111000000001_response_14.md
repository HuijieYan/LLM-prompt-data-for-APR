## Potential issues and explanation:

1. The `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string, but the actual `COPY` statement uses this variable without checking if it's empty or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The `colnames` variable is included in the `COPY` statement without checking for its presence or absence.
3. The `colnames` variable should not be present in the `COPY` statement if it is empty because it does not make sense to include an empty list of columns in the statement.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Check if the `colnames` variable is empty, and if it is, exclude it from the `COPY` statement.
2. Make sure to handle the case where `colnames` is empty and adjust the `COPY` statement accordingly.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    if not colnames:  # Remove the empty colnames from the query
        copy_query = copy_query.replace("{colnames} ", "")

    cursor.execute(copy_query)
```

With this correction, the function will check if `colnames` is empty and exclude it from the `COPY` statement if necessary. This should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
