The bug in the `copy` function is that the `copy_options` method is not being called. This results in the `options` variable being an empty string, which is not what the test is expecting.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method to retrieve the options value and include it in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options method to retrieve options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Include the options in the format string
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `options` value will be included in the `cursor.execute` statement, and the test should pass successfully.
