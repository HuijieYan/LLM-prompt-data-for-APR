The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is not properly handling the case when the `columns` parameter is `None`. This leads to an empty string being used for `colnames`, causing issues with the `COPY` statement in the test case.

Given the issue, the bug can be fixed by adding a condition to the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is `None`, and if so, set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function checks if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to extract column names, ensuring that an empty string is used for `colnames` when necessary.

After implementing this fix, the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` test case should pass without any issues.
