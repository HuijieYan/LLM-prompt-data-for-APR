The bug in the `copy` method seems to be caused by the `self.columns` being `None` when the `len` function is called on it. This is consistent with the failing test, which sets `columns` to `None`.

The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Below is the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The fix includes checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. And also calling `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement.

This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
