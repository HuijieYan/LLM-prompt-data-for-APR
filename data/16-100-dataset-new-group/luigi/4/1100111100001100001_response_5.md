The bug in the provided function is that the 'self.copy_options' function is not being called, and the result is not being used in the 'cursor.execute' statement.

The 'copy_options' function is defined within the 'S3CopyToTable' class, and it should be called to retrieve the options for the copy operation.

To fix this bug, we need to call the 'copy_options' function to get the options and use the returned value in the 'cursor.execute' statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to get the options
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the options returned from the copy_options function
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a line to call the 'copy_options' function and store the result in the 'options' variable. Then, we use the 'options' variable in the 'cursor.execute' statement.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the correct options are used in the copy operation.
