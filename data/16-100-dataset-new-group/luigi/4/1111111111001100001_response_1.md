The bug in the `copy` function lies in the incorrect usage of the `copy_options` method. In the buggy function, the `copy_options` method is being used as a property but it is actually a method that needs to be called.

The bug causes the `copy` function to not properly include any options when executing the SQL `COPY` statement.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method and include its return value in the `COPY` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By including `()` after `self.copy_options`, we are now calling the method and including its return value in the `COPY` statement.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
