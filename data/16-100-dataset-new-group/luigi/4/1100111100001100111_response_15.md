The bug in the provided function is caused by the expression `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not None. This issue is consistent with the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", where the root cause is identified as an error when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, the buggy line of code should be updated to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only accessed if `self.columns` is not None, addressing the root cause of the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
