The function `copy` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` has a bug related to the `self.columns` attribute being `None`. This causes a TypeError when trying to find the length of `self.columns`. 

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, and provide a default value for `colnames` in case `self.columns` is empty.

Here's a corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''  # Provide a default value for colnames when self.columns is None or empty
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the TypeError from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
