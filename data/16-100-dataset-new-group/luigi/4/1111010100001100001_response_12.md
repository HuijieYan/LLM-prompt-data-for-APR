The bug in the `copy` function is that it is not properly handling the `colnames` when it is empty. This results in a syntax error when trying to execute the SQL query.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `colnames` is empty by not including it in the SQL query if there are no columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    colnames_clause = '' if not colnames else colnames
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames_clause,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to handle the case where `colnames` is empty. If it's empty, we set `colnames_clause` to an empty string, otherwise, we set it to the value of `colnames`. Then, we use `colnames_clause` in the SQL query instead of `colnames`. This ensures that the SQL query is valid regardless of whether there are columns to copy or not.
