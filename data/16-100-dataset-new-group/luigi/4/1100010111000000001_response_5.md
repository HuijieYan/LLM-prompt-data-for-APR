## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a SQL `COPY` command, but it is encountering issues due to incorrect formatting and missing data.

## Potential error locations:
1. The `colnames` variable may not be formatted correctly if `self.columns` is empty.
2. The `creds` variable may not be formatted correctly.

## Cause of the bug:
The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to verify the execution of the `COPY` command with an empty `colnames` value. It seems that the buggy function is not handling the case of empty `colnames` correctly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `colnames` formatting to handle the case when `self.columns` is empty.
2. Ensure that the `creds` variable is correctly formatted.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the `copy` function, the issue with the empty `colnames` should be resolved, and the failing test should pass.
