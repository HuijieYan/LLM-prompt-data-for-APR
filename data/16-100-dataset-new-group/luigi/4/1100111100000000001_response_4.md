There are a few potential errors in the `copy` function:

1. The `cursor.execute` statement might cause an error because it is not clear what `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are returning.
2. There is a missing parenthesis in the `cursor.execute` statement when calling `self.copy_options`.

The cause of the bug is that the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` should be functions, and they are not called correctly in the `cursor.execute` statement.

To fix the bug, we should call these functions and concatenate their results with the query string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The source code of the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` are called as functions, and their results are concatenated with the query string.
