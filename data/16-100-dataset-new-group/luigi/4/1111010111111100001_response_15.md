The issue in the buggy function is that it does not handle the case when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`. This causes an error when trying to use the `len` function on a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to use it in the `copy` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, and the error should be resolved.
