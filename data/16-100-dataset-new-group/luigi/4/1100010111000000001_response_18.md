        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'

        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,

    )
```

## Explanation
The cause of the bug is that the original function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, which leads to an error when trying to get its length. The failing test verifies that the `copy` function is called with an empty `colnames` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with getting the column names and performing the `COPY` operation as usual.

The corrected version of the function includes the necessary check to handle the `None` case and performs the `COPY` operation based on the presence of `self.columns`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
