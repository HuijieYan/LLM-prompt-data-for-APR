## Analysis
The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. It appears to be a part of the Luigi library for data pipeline management. The failing test is in the file `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`, and the GitHub issue describes how the `copy` function fails when `columns` are set to `None`.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the `copy` function are the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` assuming `self.columns` is not `None`, and the generation of `colnames` using the `self.columns`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` is not `None`. The failing test demonstrates that when `columns` is set to `None`, it results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`. The issue in the GitHub details further confirm this. 

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the code should be updated to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. It can be achieved by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before performing any operation on it.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check for None before processing
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `copy` function includes a condition `if self.columns is not None` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This change ensures that the code does not try to get the length of `None`, resolving the original bug.
