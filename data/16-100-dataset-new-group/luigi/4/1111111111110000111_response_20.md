The bug in the `copy` function is caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to call `len(None)`. The buggy function also calls a method `_credentials()` and `copy_options` which are not given in the provided code, so their behavior cannot be determined.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. Additionally, in the `COPY` statement, we can skip `colnames` option altogether if `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # rest of the class remains the same

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, and the `colnames` part of the `COPY` statement will be skipped if `self.columns` is `None`. This will ensure that the bug described in the GitHub issue is fixed and the failing test should pass.
