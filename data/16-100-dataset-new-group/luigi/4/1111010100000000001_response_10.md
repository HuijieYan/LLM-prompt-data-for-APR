The buggy function `copy` defined in the `S3CopyToTable` class has the following potential errors:

1. The `logger` object is being used without being instantiated or imported.
2. The `colnames` variable is not being handled properly if `self.columns` is empty.
3. The `cursor.execute` statement is vulnerable to SQL injection due to string formatting.

The cause of the bug is that the `logger` object is not defined or imported within the class, and if `self.columns` is empty, the `colnames` variable will remain an empty string, which may cause issues in the SQL query.

To fix the bug, the `logger` object needs to be imported and instantiated, the `colnames` variable should be handled properly based on the length of `self.columns`, and the SQL query should be parameterized to prevent SQL injection.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
import logging  # Add import statement for logger

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (other class code)

    # this is the corrected copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Instantiate logger
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:  # Check if self.columns is not empty
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        sql = """
         COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
         CREDENTIALS %s
         %s
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            options=self.copy_options)
        
        cursor.execute(sql, (f, self._credentials(), self.copy_options))  # Parameterize the SQL query
```

In the corrected version, the `logger` object is instantiated and used to log the file being inserted. The `colnames` variable is checked for emptiness and handled properly. Additionally, the SQL query is parameterized to prevent SQL injection.
