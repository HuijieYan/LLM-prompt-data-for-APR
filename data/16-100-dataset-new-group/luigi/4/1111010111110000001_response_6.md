The bug in the `copy` function is due to the fact that it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly. When `self.columns` is `None`, the function attempts to check the length of `None`, which raises a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `copy` function to perform a check for `None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `copy` function performs a check for `None` on `self.columns` and sets `colnames` to an empty string if `self.columns` is `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` was `None`, and the function should now pass the failing test.
