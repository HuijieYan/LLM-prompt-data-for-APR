### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to evaluate the length of `NoneType` (`self.columns`). This implies that the `columns` attribute is not being properly handled in the `copy` function.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `copy` function where `self.columns` is being used without proper validation.

### Bug Cause:
The error occurs because the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` statement does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `if` statement should be modified to validate if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This modification checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
