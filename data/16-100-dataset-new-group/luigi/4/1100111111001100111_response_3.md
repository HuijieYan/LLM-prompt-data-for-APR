The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` variable. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is specifically testing the behavior when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

Upon analyzing the test function and the runtime values, it is evident that when `self.columns` is set to `None`, the buggy function does not handle this case correctly, leading to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix the bug, the condition checking for the length of `self.columns` should be modified to ensure it handles the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = '' if self.columns is None else ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    if colnames:
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it is `None` before attempting to calculate `colnames`. This change should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
