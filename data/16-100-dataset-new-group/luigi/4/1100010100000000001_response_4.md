## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
The buggy function has an issue with the formatting of the SQL query within the `cursor.execute` statement. The placeholders for `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options` are not properly formatted, which can lead to errors when executing the query.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the placeholders for `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options` should be properly formatted using the `format` method.

Corrected version:
The corrected version of the buggy function has the placeholders properly formatted within the `cursor.execute` statement, ensuring that the SQL query is executed correctly.
