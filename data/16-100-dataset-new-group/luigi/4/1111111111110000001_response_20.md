The cause of the bug in the `copy` function is a TypeError that occurs when attempting to get the length of `self.columns` because it is of type 'NoneType'. This leads to a failure of the `if` condition, triggering the error. The error message indicates that the bug is located in line 338 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file, where the `copy` function is called.

To fix the bug, a check should be added to see if `self.columns` is of type 'NoneType'. If it is, then the value of `colnames` should be set to an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, a check has been added to ensure that `self.columns` is not of type 'NoneType' before attempting to get its length, thus avoiding the TypeError. Additionally, the `copy_options` function is called with parentheses `()` to ensure it is correctly executed.
