## The corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed potential bug by checking if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed missing parentheses to call the function
    )
```

Explanation:
The potential bug in the original buggy function lies in the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. This condition assumes that `self.columns` is not `None`, which could lead to a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is `None`. The corrected version checks for `self.columns` to be not `None` before checking its length.

Additionally, there was a missing parentheses when calling `self.copy_options`. The corrected version adds parentheses to call the `self.copy_options` function.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
