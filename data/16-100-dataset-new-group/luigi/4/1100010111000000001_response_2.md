The potential error location within the buggy function is the `colnames` variable. The bug causes the `colnames` to be an empty string when self.columns is None. This buggy behavior is the cause of the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `colnames` is not an empty string when `self.columns` is None. This can be achieved by checking if `self.columns` is not None before joining the column names.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `colnames` will only be constructed if `self.columns` is not None, and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
