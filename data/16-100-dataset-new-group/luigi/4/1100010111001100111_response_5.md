Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, the bug seems to be related to the `self.columns` parameter being set to `None`, which causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length to avoid this error.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made to the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version includes the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This change should resolve the TypeError issue caused by `self.columns` being set to None.

With this correction, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass.

Note: Depending on the purpose of `self.columns`, it might be necessary to handle the case when `self.columns` is None differently, for example, by providing default behavior or raising an exception.
