The bug in the `copy` function is causing a TypeError when trying to check the length of the `self.columns` variable, which is of type `NoneType`. This indicates that the `self.columns` parameter is not being set correctly, leading to the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `self.columns` parameter is properly initialized and set to a valid value before using it in the `copy` function. This can be done by checking the input parameters of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class and ensuring that the `columns` parameter is set to a valid value.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to check its length, we prevent the TypeError from occurring. This should fix the bug and make the function work as expected.
