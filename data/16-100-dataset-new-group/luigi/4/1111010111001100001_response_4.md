The issue in the buggy function is that when the `columns` attribute is `None`, the `colnames` variable is not being handled correctly, resulting in an empty string for the column names. This causes the `COPY` statement to be incorrectly formatted, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the `columns` attribute is `None` and ensure that the `colnames` variable is appropriately handled in the `COPY` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to see if the `columns` attribute is `None` and handle it appropriately by setting `colnames` to an empty string. This ensures that the `COPY` statement is formatted correctly, and the test should pass now.
