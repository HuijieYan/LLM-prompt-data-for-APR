The bug in the given code is in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The bug is occurring because the `copy_options` function is not being called to retrieve the options for the `COPY` statement.

The `copy_options` function should be called as a method to retrieve the value and include it in the SQL query. Additionally, the `columns` parameter is being passed as `None` which should be handled to avoid potential errors.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should be modified to properly call the `copy_options` method and handle the `columns` parameter being `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy_options` function is properly called as a method to retrieve the options for the `COPY` statement. Additionally, the `columns` parameter is handled to avoid potential errors.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
