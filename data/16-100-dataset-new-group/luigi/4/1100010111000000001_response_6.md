The bug in the copy function lies in the colnames string generation. Because the test is calling the DummyS3CopyToTableKey(columns=None), the colnames string is being set to an empty string. However, in the execute statement, the conditional if statement is not properly checking for an empty string and is attempting to format the string regardless of its contents. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement in the copy function to properly handle the case when the columns list is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the copy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = '' if len(self.columns) == 0 else ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    if colnames:
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This correction ensures that the colnames string will be empty when the self.columns list is None, and only formatted when it contains column names. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
