### Explanation
The buggy function `copy` is failing because it is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None` properly. It attempts to use `len(self.columns)` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`, which results in the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. This issue was reported on GitHub and the suggested solution is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it's not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### The corrected version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this correction, the `copy` function will now check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the function to pass the failing test.
