Analysis:
The buggy function "copy" is responsible for defining the copying process from s3 into Redshift. It builds and executes a COPY command using SQL syntax.

Potential error locations:
1. The use of string formatting for constructing the SQL query can lead to syntax errors or injection vulnerabilities.
2. The use of "cursor" without handling potential exceptions or errors.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is due to the use of string formatting to construct the SQL query, which is error-prone and can result in syntax errors. Additionally, there are no error-handling mechanisms for the database operations performed using the "cursor" object.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should use parameterized queries to construct the SQL command, which will prevent SQL injection and syntax errors. Additionally, include proper error handling for the database operations.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
     CREDENTIALS %s
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        options=self.copy_options)

    try:
        cursor.execute(query, (f, self._credentials()))
    except psycopg2.Error as e:
        logger.error("Error copying data to Redshift: %s", str(e))
```

In the corrected version, the parameters for the SQL query are passed separately from the query string, using the cursor's execute method. This ensures that the query is executed safely without the risk of SQL injection. Error handling using a try-except block is added to handle any database errors that may occur during the execution of the query.
