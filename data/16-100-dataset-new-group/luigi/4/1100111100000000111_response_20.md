## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for executing the Redshift `COPY` command. It calls the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions from the same file but different classes.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - Incorrect usage of `self.columns` without checking for `None` causing a `TypeError`.
   - Incorrect usage of `self.copy_options` without invoking the method causing a potential error.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` correctly. This results in the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue. Additionally, the usage of `self.copy_options` is incorrect and does not invoke the method.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before performing operations on it.
2. Correctly invoke the `self.copy_options` method to obtain the options for the `COPY` command.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for None before using len()
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()  # Invoke the method to get options
    )
)
```

By making these changes, the bug related to the incorrect handling of `self.columns` and `self.copy_options` in the `COPY` function should be resolved.
