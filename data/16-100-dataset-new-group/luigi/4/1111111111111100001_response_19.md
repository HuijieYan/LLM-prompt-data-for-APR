The bug in the provided code is that the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class is set to `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when the buggy `copy` function tries to check the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `columns` is `None` before attempting to use it in the `copy` function. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will now check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to use it, and the TypeError should be resolved.
