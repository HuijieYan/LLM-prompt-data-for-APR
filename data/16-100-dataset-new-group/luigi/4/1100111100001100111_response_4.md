The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `colnames` variable being set to an empty string, and then used in the `cursor.execute` call without proper validation. This causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

To fix this bug, we can add a check for `self.columns` before setting the `colnames` variable to an empty string to prevent the TypeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before setting the `colnames` variable, preventing the TypeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.
