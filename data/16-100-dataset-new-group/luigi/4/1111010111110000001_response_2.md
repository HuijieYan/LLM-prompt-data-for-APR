The buggy function `copy` is failing because it expects `self.columns` to be a list, but in the failing test `columns` is set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when the function tries to call `len(self.columns)`.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check in the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the function will only attempt to process `self.columns` if it is not None, and the `TypeError` should no longer occur.
