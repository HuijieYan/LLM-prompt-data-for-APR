The potential error location within the buggy function is at the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None, which leads to a TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Added check for self.columns not being None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length, preventing the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
