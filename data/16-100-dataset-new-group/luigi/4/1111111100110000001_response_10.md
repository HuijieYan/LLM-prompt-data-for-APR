The bug in the code is due to the buggy function 'copy' trying to check the length of 'self.columns' without first checking if it is None or not.

To fix this bug, we need to check if 'self.columns' is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, before checking the length of 'self.columns', we first check if it is not None to avoid the 'NoneType' error. Additionally, the last line now calls the 'copy_options' method with parentheses since it is a method call.
