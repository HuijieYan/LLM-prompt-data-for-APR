The bug in the `copy` function is causing a TypeError when `self.columns` is None. The bug seems to be related to the change made in the pull request #2245, where the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` is used without explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not None.

To fix the bug, we need to add a conditional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not None, thus preventing the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub, as it addresses the root cause of the problem and ensures that the function behaves as expected even when `self.columns` is None.
