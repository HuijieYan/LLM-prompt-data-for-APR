The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is set as `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class. When the `copy` function tries to check the length of `self.columns`, it raises a `TypeError` because you cannot take the length of `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should first check if `self.columns` exists and is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length before using it, which will prevent the `TypeError` caused by a `NoneType` object.
