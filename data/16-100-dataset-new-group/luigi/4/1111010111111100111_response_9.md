The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is that it does not handle the case where the `columns` attribute is None. This leads to a TypeError because the function tries to calculate the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's None.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before calculating its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will now only attempt to calculate the length of `self.columns` if it is not None, preventing the TypeError from occurring.

This correction should address the failing test case and resolves the issue reported on GitHub related to Redshift COPY failing when `columns` are not provided.
