The bug in the provided code is that the `colnames` variable is not defined correctly, leading to an empty string value. This causes an issue when trying to format the SQL query for the `cursor.execute` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `colnames` is properly constructed based on the `self.columns` attribute before using it in the SQL query.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing `colnames`, we ensure that it is properly defined and formatted for use in the SQL query. This should fix the bug and prevent the empty string issue.
