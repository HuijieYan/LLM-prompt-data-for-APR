Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be related to the `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error occurs when the `columns` parameter is set to `None`, leading to a TypeError because the code attempts to check the length of a `NoneType` object.

The suggested fix in the GitHub issue is to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, preventing the TypeError when `self.columns` is None. This change should resolve the bug and allow the function to work correctly, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
