The buggy function 'copy' within the class 'S3CopyToTable' in the file 'luigi/contrib/redshift.py' is causing a bug where Redshift COPY jobs fail in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided. The bug is due to the code not handling the case where 'self.columns' is None. This causes a TypeError when trying to get the length of 'NoneType'.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to first check if 'self.columns' is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError and allow the function to handle the case where columns are not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check 'if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:', we ensure that the code only attempts to get the length of 'self.columns' if it is not None, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
