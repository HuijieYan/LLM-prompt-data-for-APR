## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is supposed to define the copying from S3 into Redshift. However, there are several potential error locations in the function:

1. The `colnames` calculation may not handle empty `self.columns` correctly.
2. The `COPY` query construction appears to be incorrect.
3. The usage of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` seems to be incorrect.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `copy` function appears to be caused by incorrect usage of `colnames`, invalid construction of the `COPY` query, and improper usage of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Handle the case where `self.columns` may be empty when constructing `colnames`.
2. Correctly construct the `COPY` query with the proper placeholders.
3. Ensure that `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are called correctly and their return values are used appropriately in the `COPY` query.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''  # Handle the case of empty self.columns
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames}
     FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={access_key};aws_secret_access_key={secret_key}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        access_key=self.aws_access_key_id,
        secret_key=self.aws_secret_access_key,
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
In the corrected version:
1. We handle the case of empty `self.columns` when constructing `colnames`.
2. We construct the `COPY` query with proper placeholders and use `self.aws_access_key_id` and `self.aws_secret_access_key` to provide the AWS credentials.
3. We ensure that `self.copy_options()` is called as a function.
