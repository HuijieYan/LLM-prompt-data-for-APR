### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error occurs at line 338, where the function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`. The error message states that "object of type 'NoneType' has no len()", meaning that `self.columns` is `None`.

### Identifying the Potential Error Location
The potential error location is the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement, which is trying to check the length of `self.columns`. Since the error message indicates that `self.columns` is of type 'NoneType', this is the location of the error.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `columns` attribute being set to `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to check its length.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should first ensure that the `columns` attribute is not `None` before attempting to use it. We can add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate the length.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (other code)

    # this is the corrected copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before using it
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
