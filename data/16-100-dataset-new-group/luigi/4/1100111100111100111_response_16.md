Based on the provided information, it appears that the root cause of the bug is that the `self.columns` attribute is not properly checked for being `None` before attempting to calculate its length in the `copy` function.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statement to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before calculating its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating its length, we can avoid the `TypeError` caused by attempting to calculate the length of a `NoneType` object. This fix should resolve the issue and make the `copy` function handle the case when `columns` is `None` correctly.
