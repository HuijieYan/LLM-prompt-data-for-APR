The issue in the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the `self.columns` is `None`. The error message indicates a TypeError caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for None before getting the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version adds a check for the `self.columns` variable before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, the `if` condition will be False and the code inside the block will not be executed, avoiding the TypeError that was occurring.
