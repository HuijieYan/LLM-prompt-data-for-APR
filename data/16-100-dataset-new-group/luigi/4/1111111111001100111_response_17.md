To fix the bug, we need to address the issue of handling `None` type for `self.columns`.

### Potential error location:
The bug is likely in the `copy` function where it checks the length of `self.columns`. Since the failing test has `columns=None`, this is where the bug may be occurring.

### Cause of the bug:
The root cause of the bug is in the `copy` function, where it assumes that `self.columns` is always a list and attempts to get its length without checking for `None` type. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We can modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by adding a check for `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before getting its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should address the issue reported in GitHub and also pass the failing test.
