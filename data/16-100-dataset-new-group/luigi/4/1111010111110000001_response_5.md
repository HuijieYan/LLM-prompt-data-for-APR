The bug in the 'copy' function is that it is checking the length of 'self.columns' without first verifying that 'self.columns' is not None. This causes a TypeError when trying to check the length of a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, a simple if condition can be added at the beginning of the 'copy' function to check if 'self.columns' is not None before trying to use it to retrieve its length.

Here is the corrected version of the 'copy' function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` we first make sure that 'self.columns' is not None before trying to access its length.

This revised function should now pass the failing test without causing a TypeError.
