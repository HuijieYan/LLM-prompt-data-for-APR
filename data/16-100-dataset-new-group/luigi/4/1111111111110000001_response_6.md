The bug here is that the `copy` method is assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list, and is checking its length without first checking if it's not `None`. The failing test is `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` and the corresponding error message is `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's a corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it's `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string.

This correction ensures that the `copy` method will not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
