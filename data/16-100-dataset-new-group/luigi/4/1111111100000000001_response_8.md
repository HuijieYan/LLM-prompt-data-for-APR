To fix the buggy function, we need to address the following issues:

1. The function is missing a call to `self.copy_options()` which needs to be invoked as a method to return the options for the `COPY` command.
2. The `copy_options` function is defined as a method within the `S3CopyToTable` class, but it's not being called as a method in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is invoked as a method to return the options for the `COPY` command. This will ensure that the `copy_options` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is called correctly and provides the necessary options for the `COPY` command.
