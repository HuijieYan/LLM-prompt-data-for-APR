The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is being constructed incorrectly. It is being set to an empty string and then modified, without taking into account if `self.columns` is empty or not. This results in a potential error when constructing the SQL query for the `cursor.execute` call.

To fix the bug, the `colnames` variable should only be constructed if `self.columns` is not empty. If it is empty, `colnames` should remain an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `colnames` variable will only be constructed if there are columns provided in `self.columns`, ensuring that the SQL query is constructed correctly and the bug is resolved.
