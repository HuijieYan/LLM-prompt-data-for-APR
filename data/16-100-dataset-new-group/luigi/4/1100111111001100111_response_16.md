The bug in the `copy` function is that it is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None` properly, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the length of `self.columns`.

Here's a corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length. This avoids the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and should resolve the failing test case as well.
