The issue in the `copy` function seems to be related to the `colnames` variable. It is being set to an empty string, regardless of the input columns. This causes the `COPY` statement to be generated with an empty column list, which is likely causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the `colnames` variable needs to be correctly constructed based on the `self.columns` attribute. If `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` should also be `None` to indicate that all columns should be copied.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = None
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames is not None else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By setting `colnames` to `None` when `self.columns` is `None`, the corrected function should generate the correct `COPY` statement and pass the failing test.
