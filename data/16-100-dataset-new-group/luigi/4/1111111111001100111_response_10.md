The bug in the function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` is causing it to fail the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the file `redshift_test.py`. The bug causes the function to throw a `TypeError` when `columns` is None.

The issue is related to commit https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/2245/files#diff-778ea3db4cccaf4de6564889c5eb670fR338, and it seems that the conditional check for the length of `self.columns` is causing the problem.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

Here is the corrected version of the function `copy`:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is None, and the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` will pass, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
