## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
The cause of the bug in the original function is that the SQL COPY statement is not properly formatted. The placeholders for table, colnames, source, creds, and options are not being replaced with their actual values when formatting the string.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the placeholders in the SQL COPY statement and ensure they match the variables used in the format() method.
2. Make sure the placeholders are properly replaced with the actual values.

In the corrected version, the placeholders in the SQL COPY statement are properly formatted and matched with the variables used in the format() method. This ensures that the placeholders are replaced with the actual values when executing the SQL statement.
