Based on the analysis, it appears that the root cause of the issue is the buggy function not handling the case where the self.columns attribute is set to None, leading to a TypeError when attempting to get the length of None.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the copy function to correctly handle the case where self.columns is None.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to see if self.columns is not None before attempting to use it to create the colnames string. If self.columns is None, then colnames is set to an empty string.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the buggy function handles the case when columns are not provided properly.
