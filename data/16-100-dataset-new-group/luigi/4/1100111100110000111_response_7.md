## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The bug was due to directly trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not None. By adding a check for `self.columns` before checking its length, we ensure that it is safe to perform the length check. This change should resolve the TypeError when `columns` is passed as None while running Redshift COPY jobs in Luigi 2.7.1.

This corrected version should address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
