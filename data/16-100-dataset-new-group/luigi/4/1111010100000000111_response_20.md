## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The issue on GitHub mentions that when `columns` are not provided, the Redshift COPY job fails.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error is in the `copy` function where it checks the length of `self.columns`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always be provided, leading to a `NoneType` error when it is not provided. This is in line with the information provided in the GitHub issue. The fix suggested in the GitHub issue is to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before using it.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before using it. This will prevent the `NoneType` error when `columns` are not provided.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    # Check if columns exist and have a length greater than 0
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `NoneType` error is avoided when `columns` are not provided.
