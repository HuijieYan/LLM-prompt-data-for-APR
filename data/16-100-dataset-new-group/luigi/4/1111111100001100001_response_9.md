The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect usage of the 'self._credentials()' and 'self.copy_options' functions inside the cursor.execute() statement. Both of these functions are class methods, and they should be called using the self keyword. Additionally, the 'copy_options' function should be called as a method with parentheses, because it is defined as a method in the class.

To fix the bug, we need to call the 'self._credentials()' and 'self.copy_options()' functions correctly and provide the correct values for the placeholders in the cursor.execute() statement.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # correct call to _credentials method
        options=self.copy_options()  # correct call to copy_options method
        )
    )
```

In the corrected version, the 'self._credentials()' and 'self.copy_options()' functions are called correctly by using the self keyword and parentheses. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to execute as intended.
