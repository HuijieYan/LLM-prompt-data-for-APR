The issue in the buggy function seems to be with the use of the `copy_options` method, which is intended to return a string, but it's being used as a method without calling it. This is causing the `options` variable to be assigned the method object itself instead of the return value of the method.

To fix this, we need to call the `copy_options` method and use its return value as the `options` variable in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the method here to get its return value
    )
```

By making this change, the `options` variable will now have the correct value and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
