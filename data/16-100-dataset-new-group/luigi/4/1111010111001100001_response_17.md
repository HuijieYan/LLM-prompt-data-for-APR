The potential error in the buggy function is in the `copy` method where the `colnames` variable is not being set correctly. This is causing the `COPY` statement to be formed incorrectly, leading to the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that when the `columns` attribute is `None`, the `colnames` variable is not being set to an empty string as expected, resulting in an incorrect `COPY` statement being executed.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set the `colnames` variable to an empty string in that scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`, ensuring that the `COPY` statement is formed correctly. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
