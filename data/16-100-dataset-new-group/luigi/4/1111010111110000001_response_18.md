The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing to handle the case when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. The method tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when it tries to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for `None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can handle it appropriately, for example, by setting `colnames` to an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
