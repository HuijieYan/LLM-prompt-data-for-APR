The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. The function takes a `cursor` and a file path `f` as arguments and is intended to copy data from S3 into Redshift. However, the function is throwing a `TypeError` when it tries to access the `len` of `self.columns`, indicating that `self.columns` is of type `NoneType`.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None`, and then calls the `run` method. Inside the `run` method, the `copy` function is called, and it tries to access the `len` of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly, leading to the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to add a check in the `copy` function to see if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a check is added to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and the function should now handle the `None` value correctly.
