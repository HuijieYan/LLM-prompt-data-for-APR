The potential error location within the buggy function is the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` statement, which is causing an error when `self.columns` is None.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function is not properly handling the case when `self.columns` is None, which is triggering a TypeError when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` statement to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
