### Explanation
The bug in the original function is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length in the `if` condition. The GitHub issue also identifies this as the root cause of the problem. The issue states that the code should be modified to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `if` condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` issue.

### Corrected Version
The corrected version of the function includes the modification to the `if` condition to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. This modification ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if `self.columns` is not None.
