The buggy function `copy` is throwing a TypeError when trying to access the length of `self.columns` when it is None. This is causing the test to fail with the error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. 

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is None, so that the length is not accessed when it is not valid. This can be done using an if condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length.

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will now check if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length, preventing the TypeError from occurring and addressing the buggy behavior.
