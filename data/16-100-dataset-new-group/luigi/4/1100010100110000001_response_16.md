# The buggy function attempts to execute the COPY command on a redshift table using the passed cursor and file path. However, it fails with a TypeError.

# The cause of the bug is the comparison "if len(self.columns) > 0", where if the self.columns is None, it throws a TypeError when trying to get length of NoneType.

# To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when self.columns is None before checking its length.

# Also, the colnames variable should be set to None initially and only get assigned if self.columns is not None.

# Given below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = None
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
