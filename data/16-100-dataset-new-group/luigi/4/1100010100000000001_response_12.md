## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file has a few potential error locations:
1. The use of string formatting in the `cursor.execute` method could lead to syntax errors if any of the provided values contain special characters that are not properly escaped.
2. There is a possibility of missing or incorrectly formatted input parameters for the `COPY` command, which could result in incorrect data being copied into the Redshift table.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the string formatting used in the `cursor.execute` method is susceptible to syntax errors and the input parameters are not being properly formatted for the `COPY` command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to use parameterized queries instead of string formatting to ensure that the input parameters are properly escaped and formatted. Additionally, we should validate the input parameters to ensure they are correctly formatted for the `COPY` command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {} {} from %s
     CREDENTIALS %s
     {}
     ;""".format(
        self.table,
        colnames,
        self.copy_options), (f, self._credentials()))
```
