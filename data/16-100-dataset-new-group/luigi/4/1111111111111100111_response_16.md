## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Explanation:
I have fixed the buggy function by adding a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`. This will ensure that the `len` function is only called if `self.columns` is not None. This approach addresses the TypeError caused by calling `len` on a NoneType.

The GitHub issue pointed out the specific line causing the issue, and the proposed solution was to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before calling `len(self.columns)`. This aligns with the solution I have implemented.
