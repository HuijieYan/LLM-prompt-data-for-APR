The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is not properly executing the SQL `COPY` command. The bug is in the `cursor.execute` statement where `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are not being called as functions.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` are called as functions in the `cursor.execute` statement. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `colnames` variable is properly handled when building the SQL query.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # other functions remain the same
    
    # the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` are properly called as functions with `()` at the end. Additionally, the `colnames` variable is handled properly when building the SQL query.
