### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing with a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is set to `None`. This is related to the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", which suggests a potential solution to handle the `None` condition for `self.columns`.

### Potential error locations:
- The line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` will throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without first ensuring that it is not `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Update the condition to check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By updating the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, the corrected version of the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This change should resolve the TypeError issue when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to `None`.
