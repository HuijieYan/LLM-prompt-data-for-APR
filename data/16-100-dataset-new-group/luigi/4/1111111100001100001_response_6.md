The bug in the given function is the usage of `self.copy_options` without calling it as a method. It should be `self.copy_options()`. 

The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a SQL query to copy data from an S3 source to a Redshift table. However, it is not calling `self.copy_options` as a method, and it is not providing a proper value for the `options` parameter in the SQL query.

To fix the bug, we need to call `self.copy_options()` to get the actual copy options and provide a valid value for the `options` parameter in the SQL query.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is called as a method to get the actual copy options, and the result is provided as the value for the `options` parameter in the SQL query.
