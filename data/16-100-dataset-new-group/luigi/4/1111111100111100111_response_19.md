Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to the `self.columns` attribute being `None` and causing a TypeError when checking its length.

The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying that it is not None. This causes the TypeError when trying to call `len(self.columns)`.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should be updated to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` statement checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This change ensures that the TypeError will not occur when `self.columns` is `None`.

This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and should resolve the failing test.
