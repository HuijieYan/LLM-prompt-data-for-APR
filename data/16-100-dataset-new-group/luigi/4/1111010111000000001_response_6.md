The bug in the `copy` function lies in how it handles the `colnames` variable when `self.columns` is None. The buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list, and doesn't handle the case when it is None.

The bug is confirmed by the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, which instantiates `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`. The `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class is a dummy subclass of `S3CopyToTable` used for testing.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should check if `self.columns` is None, and set `colnames` to an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `copy` function will set `colnames` to an empty string when `self.columns` is None, and the failing test should pass.
