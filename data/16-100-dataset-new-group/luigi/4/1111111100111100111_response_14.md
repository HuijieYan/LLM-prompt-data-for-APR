### Analysis
The bug is occurring because the `self.columns` parameter is set to `None`, and the buggy function is trying to check its length without first checking if it exists. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The issue is with the condition `len(self.columns) > 0` because `self.columns` is set to `None`.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is the improper handling of the `self.columns` parameter. When it is set to `None`, the buggy function is directly trying to calculate the length without first checking if it exists or if it is not `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by first checking if `self.columns` exists and is not `None`, and then checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The updated condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` checks if `self.columns` exists and is not `None`, and then calculates its length. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
