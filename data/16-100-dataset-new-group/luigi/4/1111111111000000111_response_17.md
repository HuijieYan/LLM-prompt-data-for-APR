## Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

The bug in the original `copy` function was that it did not check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to retrieve its length. This caused an error when `columns` is None and the code attempted to use the `len` function on it.

The corrected version of the function checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to retrieve its length and construct the `colnames`. If `self.columns` is None, the `colnames` will remain an empty string.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
