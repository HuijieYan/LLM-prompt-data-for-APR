## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = '' if not self.columns else ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames='({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
The initial buggy code did not handle the case where self.columns is None, causing a TypeError when trying to check the length of None. The corrected version uses a conditional expression to set colnames to an empty string if self.columns is None, and only constructs the comma-separated list of column names if self.columns is not None.

By making this change, we address the root cause of the issue reported on GitHub, which was related to the failure of Redshift COPY jobs when columns were not provided. The corrected version will now handle the case where columns are None and prevent the TypeError from occurring.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
