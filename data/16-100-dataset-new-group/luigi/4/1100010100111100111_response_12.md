The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check, where `self.columns` is a `NoneType`, resulting in a `TypeError`. This bug has been reported in the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".

To fix the bug, the `if len(self.columns) > 0` should be modified to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to perform a check for the existence of `self.columns` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function will now properly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`, as reported in the GitHub issue, and the failing test case is expected to pass with this corrected function.
