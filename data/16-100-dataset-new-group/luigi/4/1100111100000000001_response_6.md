The potential error in the buggy function is in the `cursor.execute` block. In the `COPY` statement, the `creds` parameter calls the `_credentials()` function, which is not being called properly. Additionally, the `options` parameter is calling the `copy_options()` function without parentheses, which means it is referencing the function without actually calling it.

The bug is being caused by the incorrect calling of the `_credentials()` and `copy_options()` functions within the `cursor.execute` block. The `_credentials()` function should be called with parentheses, and the `copy_options()` function should also be called with parentheses to properly retrieve the options.

To fix the bug, the `_credentials()` and `copy_options()` functions need to be called with parentheses to properly retrieve the necessary credentials and options. Additionally, the `copy_options` function should be checked to ensure it's returning the appropriate options for the `COPY` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def _credentials(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def copy_options(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
