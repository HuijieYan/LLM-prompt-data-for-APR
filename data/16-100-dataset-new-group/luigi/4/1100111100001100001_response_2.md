### Bug explanation
The bug in the `copy` function is that the `creds` and `options` are not being evaluated properly. The `creds` are obtained using the `_credentials` function and the `options` are obtained using the `copy_options` function. However, both of these functions are not being called correctly.

The `_credentials` function should be called with `self._credentials()` and the `copy_options` function should be called with `self.copy_options()`.

Additionally, the `options` obtained from `self.copy_options()` should be called as a function to obtain the actual options string.

### Bug fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `cursor.execute` statement to call the correct functions and obtain the actual options string.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
In this corrected version, `self._credentials()` is called to obtain the credentials, and `self.copy_options()` is called as a function to obtain the actual options string.
