The bug in the `copy` function is that the `copy_options` function is being referenced without being called. This means that the actual `copy_options` function is not executed and its result is not included in the query being executed by `cursor.execute`.

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` function should be called and its result should be included in the query being executed by `cursor.execute`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    # Call the copy_options function and include its result in the query
    options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy_options` function is called and its result is included in the `COPY` query being executed by `cursor.execute`. This should resolve the bug and the failing test.
