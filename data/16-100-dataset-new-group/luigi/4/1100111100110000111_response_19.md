The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. It is attempting to execute a Redshift `COPY` command but is encountering a TypeError when checking the length of `self.columns`, which is None.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None. This is evident from the error message indicating that a TypeError is raised when attempting to check the length of `self.columns` when it is None. The GitHub issue also confirms that running Redshift `COPY` jobs with `columns = None` is causing the error.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `if` statement to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to check its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the corrected function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to check its length, avoiding the TypeError. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
