The bug in the `copy` function is due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it tries to check the length of `self.columns`, which results in a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` so that it first checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixing the condition here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, avoiding the TypeError. This corrected version should resolve the issue as reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
