The bug in the provided function is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` without checking if `self.columns` is None. According to the GitHub issue, running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None fails because the function does not handle the case when columns are not provided. The suggested solution on GitHub is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length, the bug is fixed, and the function should now work correctly, handling the case when columns are not provided.
