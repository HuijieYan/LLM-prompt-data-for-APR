### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a TypeError when the `columns` attribute is `None`. This error is occurring due to an attempt to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

The related test case in `redshift_test.py` provided by the GitHub issue also confirms that when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, the bug occurs.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The above line attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the lack of a check for the None value of `self.columns` before attempting to get its length. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code still tries to check its length, leading to a TypeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, a check needs to be added before attempting to check the length of `self.columns`. This check should verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before performing any operations on it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for None before getting the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before attempting to get its length, the bug is resolved. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
