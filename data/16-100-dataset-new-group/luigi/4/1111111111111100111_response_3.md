The buggy function is the `copy` method inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for defining the copying process from s3 into Redshift.

Upon analyzing the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file, we can see that the test is failing due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` in the `copy` method.

The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute of the `S3CopyToTable` class is set to `None`, which leads to the `TypeError`. The failing test is a result of calling the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, which eventually leads to calling the `copy` method with a `None` value for the `columns` attribute.

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" also explains the cause of the bug and suggests a potential solution.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the `copy` method to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to retrieve its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )

```

With the above correction, the `copy` method will now check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
