## The buggy function

The `copy` function from the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file is not correctly handling the `colnames` parameter and `copy_options` function.

## Potential error locations

1. The `colnames` variable is not being handled properly.
2. The `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` is not being populated from the `copy_options` function.

## Cause of the bug

The bug is caused by the `colnames` not being handled correctly which results in incorrect SQL generation and also the `copy_options` function not being called to populate the `options` parameter.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Properly handle the `colnames` variable based on the length of `self.columns`.
2. Call the `copy_options` function to populate the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` call.

## The corrected version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
