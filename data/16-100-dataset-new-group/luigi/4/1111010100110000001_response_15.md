The bug in the provided function is due to the comparison of the 'columns' attribute with length. The code checks if the 'columns' attribute is not None before trying to access its length, but this check is not sufficient as the 'columns' attribute can still be None and not have a length. This causes a TypeError when trying to access the length of a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, a more explicit check for None should be added to ensure that the 'columns' attribute is not None before attempting to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the explicit check for None before accessing the length of the 'columns' attribute, the bug should be fixed and the TypeError should be resolved.
