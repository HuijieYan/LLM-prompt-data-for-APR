The issue in the `copy` function arises from the `colnames` variable not being formatted correctly if `self.columns` is empty. This is causing the test to fail because the `colnames` are expected to be an empty string in this case.

To fix the bug, we need to add a conditional check to handle the case where `self.columns` is empty, and initialize `colnames` accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we've added a check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not empty before building the `colnames` string. Additionally, we have also called the `copy_options` function with parentheses, since it appears to be a method rather than a property based on how it's being used in the `cursor.execute` function.

With these changes, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
