### Bug Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the buggy function is trying to obtain the length of a variable that is of type `NoneType`.
2. The corresponding GitHub issue suggests that a recent change in the code causing this error, and it recommends a possible solution.

### Bug Location:
The error is occurring at this line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The `self.columns` variable is of type `NoneType`, which is causing the error.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None. This causes the subsequent attempt to get the length of `self.columns` to raise a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to obtain its length, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the buggy function should handle the case where `self.columns` is None and no longer raise a `TypeError`.
