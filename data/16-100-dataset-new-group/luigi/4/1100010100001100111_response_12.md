The bug in the provided function arises from the logic used to check the length of the columns when they are set to None. This bug causes a TypeError when trying to determine the length of NoneType.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the length of the columns. We will update the code to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length to avoid the TypeError.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will first check if self.columns is not None before attempting to determine its length, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
