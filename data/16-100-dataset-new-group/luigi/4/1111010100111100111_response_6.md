The bug in the provided code is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition. When the `self.columns` parameter is `None`, the code fails because it cannot calculate the length of a `NoneType` object. 

To fix the bug, we should update the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not None, and then check for its length. This will prevent the error when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` first checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to calculate its length. This prevents the TypeError when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
