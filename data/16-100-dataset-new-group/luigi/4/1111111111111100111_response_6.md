The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` from the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to the `self.columns` attribute being `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to evaluate `len(self.columns) > 0`.

The `copy` function is responsible for defining the copy operation from s3 into Redshift, and it constructs a SQL `COPY` statement using attributes such as `self.table`, `colnames`, `f`, `creds`, and `options`. The issue arises when it tries to create the `colnames` string based on the `self.columns` attribute, which is determined to be of type `None`.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, and then calls the `run` method, which eventually calls the `copy` method with the `cursor` parameter. During the execution of the `copy` method, it attempts to evaluate `len(self.columns) > 0`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to `NoneType` not having a `len` attribute.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement in the `copy` method should be modified to check if `self.columns` exists and has a non-zero length before constructing the `colnames` string.

Based on the GitHub issue, the suggested solution is to change the line to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` method will first check if `self.columns` is not None and has a non-zero length before constructing the `colnames` string, effectively addressing the bug.
