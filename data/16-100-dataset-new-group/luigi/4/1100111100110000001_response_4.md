The bug in the provided code is that it is not handling the case when the `self.columns` variable is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when the buggy function tries to check the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is `None`. If it is `None`, then `colnames` should also be `None` to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # other functions

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = None  # Initialize colnames as None
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None and has length > 0
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames='' if colnames is None else colnames,  # If colnames is None, set it to an empty string
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By initializing `colnames` as `None` and checking if `self.columns` is not `None` and has a length greater than 0, we can avoid the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
