To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The issue on GitHub suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to address the problem.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The changes made include adding a check for `self.columns` to be not None before attempting to calculate the `colnames`. This change will prevent the TypeError caused by `NoneType` not having a `len()` function.

By making this modification, the corrected function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing any errors, effectively resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
