The buggy function `copy` is failing with a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType'` has no len(), which is caused by the check `if len(self.columns) > 0`, where `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can initialize `colnames` as an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the check for `None` in `self.columns` is added before attempting to get the length, which should resolve the TypeError.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
