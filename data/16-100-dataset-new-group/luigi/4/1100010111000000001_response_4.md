The issue with the buggy function lies in the `colnames` variable. In the `copy` function, the `colnames` variable is empty when the `self.columns` list is empty or None. This leads to a SQL syntax error when trying to execute the `COPY` statement.
To fix this issue, we should check if `self.columns` is None and handle it accordingly to avoid the SQL syntax error.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not None, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is only populated with column names if `self.columns` is not empty. This will prevent the SQL syntax error that was occurring in the failing test.

After making this change, the `copy` function should pass the failing test and execute the `COPY` statement without any syntax errors.
