The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the check `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which throws a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This issue has been reported on GitHub and a suggested solution is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `if` statement as suggested in the GitHub issue. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the bug causing the `TypeError` will be fixed.
