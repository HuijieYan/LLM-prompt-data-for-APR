## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:  # check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

## Explanation:

The bug in the original code arises from the assumption that `self.columns` always contains a non-empty list, which causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` specifically tests the case when `columns` is `None` and expects the `COPY` operation to handle it properly.

The GitHub issue describes the same problem and suggests a solution to the issue by ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

In the corrected version, the `if` condition has been modified to `if self.columns` to check if the `columns` attribute is not `None` before attempting to use it. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

By making this change, the corrected function will now handle the case when `columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
