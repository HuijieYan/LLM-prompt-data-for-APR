The bug in the provided function is that the 'creds' parameter is not being properly formatted in the cursor.execute() statement.

The cause of the bug is that the 'creds' parameter is being passed as a string in the cursor.execute() statement, but it needs to be formatted as a JSON object.

To fix the bug, the 'creds' parameter should be formatted as a JSON object using the json.dumps() function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import json

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=json.dumps(self._credentials()),  # Format creds as a JSON object
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the 'creds' parameter will be properly formatted as a JSON object, fixing the bug in the function.
