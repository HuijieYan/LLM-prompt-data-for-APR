The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is causing a TypeError when `self.columns` is None. This bug has been reported in a GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".

The bug occurs because the `copy` function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This causes an error when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length and construct the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not None before attempting to get its length and construct the `colnames` string. This should fix the issue reported on GitHub and allow the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None without causing a TypeError.
