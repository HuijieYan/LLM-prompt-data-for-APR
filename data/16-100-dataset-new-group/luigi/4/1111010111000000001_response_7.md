The potential error in the buggy function lies in the `colnames` variable. In the `copy` function, if `self.columns` is None, the `colnames` will remain as an empty string, which can cause an issue when formatting the `COPY` SQL statement.

The bug causes the resulting SQL statement to have an extra comma when `self.columns` is None, leading to a syntax error.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not None before constructing the `colnames` string. If `self.columns` is None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the extra comma.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:  # Checking for None or empty list
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use an `if self.columns:` check to handle the case where `self.columns` is None or an empty list. If `self.columns` is None, `colnames` will be set to an empty string to prevent the extra comma in the `COPY` SQL statement. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the SQL statement is properly constructed.
