The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute when it is `None`. The `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string when there are no columns, but it should be set to `None` to avoid the extra comma in the `COPY` statement.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `copy` function to check if the `columns` attribute is `None`. If it is `None`, we will set `colnames` to `None`. If it is not `None`, we will construct the comma-separated string as before.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = None
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `colnames` variable will be set to `None` when the `columns` attribute is `None`, which will correctly handle the case when there are no columns. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
