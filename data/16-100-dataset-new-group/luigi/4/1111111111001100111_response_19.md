The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class seems to be related to the `self.columns` attribute being None, causing a TypeError when trying to get its length.

The root cause of the bug seems to be that when `self.columns` is set to `None`, the buggy function does not handle this case properly, leading to the TypeError when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the buggy function to properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by adding a check for it before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns` to make sure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. Additionally, we also corrected the method call to `self.copy_options()` to properly call the `copy_options` method.

With this correction, the bug should be fixed and the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a TypeError. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
