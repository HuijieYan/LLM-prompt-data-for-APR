The bug in the provided function is due to the logic to check the length of the columns list. If the columns attribute is set to None, it causes an error when trying to check its length. The GitHub issue also confirms this bug and suggests a solution to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to check if self.columns is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if self.columns is not None before proceeding to check its length, which addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
