The bug in the given function is causing a TypeError due to the comparison of the length of a NoneType object. This is happening because the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, and the function does not handle this case properly.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to retrieve its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This fix adds a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to retrieve its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, the code inside the if statement will not be executed, avoiding the TypeError.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
