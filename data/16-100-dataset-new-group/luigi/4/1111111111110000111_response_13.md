### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Explanation:
The issue is occurring due to the buggy function not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

The corrected version of the function checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, thereby preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

The corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.

The corrected line:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. If it is `None`, the condition will evaluate to `False` and the code inside the `if` block will be skipped.
