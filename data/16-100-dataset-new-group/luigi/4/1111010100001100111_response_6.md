The issue is caused by the buggy function not handling the case where self.columns is None, resulting in a TypeError when trying to check its length.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to handle the case where self.columns is None. We can also simplify the condition to improve readability.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The modification checks if self.columns is not None before trying to access its length, preventing the TypeError from occurring. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
