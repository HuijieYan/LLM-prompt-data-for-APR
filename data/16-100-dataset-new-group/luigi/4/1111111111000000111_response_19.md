## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

The bug was due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement, which doesn't handle the case when `self.columns` is None. By adding `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we account for the case when `self.columns` is None and prevent the TypeError from occurring.

The corrected version of the function now includes the suggested fix from the GitHub issue. This fix handles the case when `self.columns` is None and prevents the TypeError from occurring.
