The bug in the `copy` function is that `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function. It is missing the parentheses `()` to actually call the function and retrieve the result. This is causing the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` call to be an empty string instead of the result of calling the `copy_options` function.

To fix this bug, we need to add the parentheses to call the `self.copy_options` function and retrieve its result.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the parentheses to call `self.copy_options` as a function, we ensure that the result is used as the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` call. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
