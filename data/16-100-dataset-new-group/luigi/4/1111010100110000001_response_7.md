The bug in the provided function is causing a TypeError because it is trying to get the length of a NoneType object, specifically `self.columns` when constructing `colnames`. This leads to the error when the `columns` attribute is passed as None in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length, preventing the TypeError. This should resolve the issue and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
