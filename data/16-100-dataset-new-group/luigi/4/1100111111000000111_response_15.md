## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed condition to check for NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Added parentheses to call the function correctly
    )
```

## Explanation:
The bug in the original function was caused by not checking for NoneType before accessing the length of the columns. The failing test provided in the GitHub issue showed the failure when columns were set to None.

The fix involved modifying the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length. Additionally, there was a missing pair of parentheses when calling `self.copy_options`, which was also fixed in the corrected version.

By addressing these issues, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
