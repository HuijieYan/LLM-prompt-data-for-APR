The bug is in the if statement `if len(self.columns) > 0:` inside the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `self.columns` which is of type 'NoneType' and cannot be used with the `len` function.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None and bypass the `len` check.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Added a check for self.columns being not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `len` function is only called on `self.columns` if it exists and is not None. This will prevent the TypeError that was occurring in the failing test.
