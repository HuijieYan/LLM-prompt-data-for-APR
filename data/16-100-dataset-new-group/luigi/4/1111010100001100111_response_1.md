The bug in the provided function `copy` is that it assumes `self.columns` is always a list with at least one element, causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is None. This issue has been reported in the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".

To fix the bug, the function should first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
