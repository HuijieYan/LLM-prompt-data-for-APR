The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the `self.columns` variable is `None`. This causes the function to try to evaluate the length of a `NoneType` object, leading to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error message.

To fix this bug, we can add a check for `None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and the test should pass without raising the `TypeError` anymore.
