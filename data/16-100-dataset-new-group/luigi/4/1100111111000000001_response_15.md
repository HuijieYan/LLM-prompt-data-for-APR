The bug in the `copy` function appears to be related to the `colnames` parameter being an empty string when there are no columns specified. This results in an extra comma in the `COPY` statement, causing the Redshift query to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `colnames` is empty and ensure that the extra comma does not appear in the `COPY` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if colnames:
        colnames = ' ' + colnames  # Add a space before colnames

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table}{colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added a condition to check if `colnames` is not empty and added a space before `colnames` when constructing the `COPY` statement. This ensures that there is no extra comma when `colnames` is empty.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
