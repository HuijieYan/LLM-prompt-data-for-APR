## Explanation
The error message indicates that there is a TypeError due to trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is None. This coincides with the information from the GitHub issue, which suggests that the bug occurs when `columns` are set to `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug fix involves checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function will check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, preventing the TypeError from occurring. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
