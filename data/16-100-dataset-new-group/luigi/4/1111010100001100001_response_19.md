The issue in the buggy function is likely due to the `creds` variable being incorrectly formatted or missing. This can cause the `cursor.execute` call to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `creds` variable is correctly formatted and provided to the `cursor.execute` call.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    credentials = self._credentials() if self._credentials() else 'aws_access_key_id=<key>;aws_secret_access_key=<secret>'
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a default value for credentials in case none are provided by `self._credentials()`. This ensures that the `creds` variable is always populated and the `cursor.execute` call will not fail due to missing credentials.
