The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case where the "columns" parameter is set to None. This causes the error "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" when the function tries to check the length of the columns.

To fix this bug, the buggy function should check if "self.columns" is not None before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles the case where "columns" is set to None and should pass the failing test. This also resolves the issue posted on GitHub about Redshift COPY failing when columns are not provided.
