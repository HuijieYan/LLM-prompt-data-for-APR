The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `copy` does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to call `len` on a `NoneType`.

To fix the bug, we should update the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function should now properly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, resolving the issue reported in GitHub and passing the failing test.
