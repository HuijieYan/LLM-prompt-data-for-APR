## Now let's fix the bug!

### Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `self.columns` parameter is `None`, causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, which also points out the cause of the bug. 

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `copy` function at line 338, where it checks the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without first validating whether it is None. This causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line that checks the length of `self.columns` to first validate whether `self.columns` is not None.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Validate whether self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This change will prevent the TypeError caused by `self.columns` being None.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
