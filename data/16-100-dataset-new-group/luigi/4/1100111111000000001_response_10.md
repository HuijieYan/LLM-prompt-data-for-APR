The bug in the `copy` function is that it is trying to call the `copy_options` method directly without instantiating an object. 

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to create an instance of the `S3CopyToTable` object and then call the `copy_options` method within the `copy` function. 

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_options = self.copy_options()  # Instantiate the object and call the copy_options method

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options)  # Use the instantiated copy_options variable here
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will properly call the `copy_options` method and use the correct options in the `COPY` statement. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
