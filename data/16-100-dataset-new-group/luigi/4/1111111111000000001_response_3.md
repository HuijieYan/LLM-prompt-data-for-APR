The bug in the `copy` function seems to be caused by the fact that the `options` parameter that is passed to the `COPY` statement is calling the `copy_options` function without executing it. Additionally, the `colnames` variable is not properly handled if `self.columns` is empty or `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to execute the `copy_options` function and handle the `colnames` variable when `self.columns` is empty or `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have fixed the `colnames` handling and executed the `copy_options` function to provide the correct `options` parameter to the `COPY` statement.

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
