## Error Analysis
The error occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. It is part of the Luigi library and is used to define a task for copying data from Amazon S3 into Redshift. The error is causing a TypeError when the `columns` attribute is set to None.

The GitHub issue describes the problem correctly, mentioning that when `columns` is set to None, the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition causes a TypeError. The suggested solution is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function attempts to check the length of the `columns` attribute without first confirming that it is not `None`. When `columns` is set to `None`, the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0` results in a TypeError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check in the `copy` function to first validate that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the conditional check ensures that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to determine its length, preventing the TypeError. This corrected code should resolve the bug and pass the failing test in the GitHub issue.
