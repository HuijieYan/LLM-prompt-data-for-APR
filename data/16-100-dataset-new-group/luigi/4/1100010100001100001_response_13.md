The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string, even when there are columns specified in the input.

The `colnames` variable is being derived from the `self.columns` attribute, which is not reflected in the input parameters. So, it's assumed that `self.columns` is a list of column names. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case when there are columns specified. It is failing to construct the `colnames` correctly based on the input columns.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not empty, and if it's not empty, construct the `colnames` based on the input columns.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we've added a condition to check if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing `colnames`. If `self.columns` is not empty, we construct `colnames` based on the input columns.
