The bug in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is None before trying to retrieve its length. The function assumes `self.columns` will always be a list and does not handle the case where it might be None.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `self.columns` being None before trying to retrieve its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function will now check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to retrieve its length, preventing the TypeError when `self.columns` is None. This change will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
