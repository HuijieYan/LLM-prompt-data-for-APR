There is a bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file in the Luigi library. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to None, causing a TypeError when the code attempts to get the length of `self.columns`.

The cause of the bug is that the code directly checks for `len(self.columns) > 0` without first verifying if `self.columns` is not None.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Explicitly check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the bug should be fixed, and the `TypeError` should no longer occur when `self.columns` is set to None. This fix will address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
