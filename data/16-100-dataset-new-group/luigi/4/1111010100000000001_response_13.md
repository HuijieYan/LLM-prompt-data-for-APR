Potential error locations:
1. The use of the logger without its definition.
2. The use of the uninitialized variable colnames.

Cause of the bug:
The bug may be caused by the use of the logger without its definition, and the uninitialized variable colnames. These can lead to errors and unexpected behavior in the copy function.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Define the logger before using it in the function.
2. Initialize the colnames variable to avoid any potential errors.

Corrected version:
```python
import logging

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.

    ... (rest of the class documentation stays the same)
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Define the logger
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

        colnames = ''  # Initialize colnames variable
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

In the corrected version, we have defined the logger before using it in the function, and also initialized the colnames variable to avoid any potential errors.
