The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `redshift.py` file is failing to handle the case when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. This can be observed from the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `redshift_test.py` file. When the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, the buggy function tries to perform `len(self.columns)` which results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, we check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If it's None, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This corrected version of the function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is set to `None` and pass the failing test.

This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub, providing a clear code change to handle the situation when `columns` is `None`.
