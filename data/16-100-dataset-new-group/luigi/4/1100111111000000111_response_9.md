## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )  # Call the copy_options function instead of passing it as a reference
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we prevent the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is None. Additionally, we changed `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to execute the function. This corrected version addresses the issue reported in GitHub and should resolve the failing test.
