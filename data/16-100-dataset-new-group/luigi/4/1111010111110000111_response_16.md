The issue lies in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The problem occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.

The error message from the failing test indicates that a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` is raised when trying to check the length of `self.columns`. The GitHub issue also points out that the root cause is related to the PR in the GitHub repository. Additionally, the GitHub issue suggests a solution to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to avoid the error.

To resolve the bug, the logic in the `copy` function needs to be adjusted to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` condition is modified to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
