To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to address the following issues:
1. The `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are being called without the `self` parameter passed, which is incorrect.
2. The `options=self.copy_options` statement in the `cursor.execute` call is missing parentheses, causing the `copy_options` function to be considered as a string instead of a function call.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the function calls and add the missing parentheses for the `copy_options` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
