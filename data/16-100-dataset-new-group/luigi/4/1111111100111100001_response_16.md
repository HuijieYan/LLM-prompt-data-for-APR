The bug in the provided function is that it's not handling the case where the `self.columns` attribute is `None`. This causes the function to raise a TypeError when trying to check the length of `self.columns`. 

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Added check for self.columns not being None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to compute its length. This should fix the TypeError caused by `self.columns` being `None` in the failing test case.
