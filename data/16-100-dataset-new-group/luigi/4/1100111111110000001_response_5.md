The issue with the buggy code is that it does not handle the case when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the `len` of `None`. This causes the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to fail.

To fix this bug, the `self.columns` attribute should be checked for `None` before trying to get its length, and an empty string should be used for `colnames` in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this fix, the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass without any `TypeError` related to `NoneType`.
