To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to address the issue where the function is attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's None. We should also ensure that `self.copy_options` is called as a function. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. Additionally, we added parentheses after `self.copy_options` to call it as a function.

By making these changes, the bug related to the TypeError for `NoneType` in the `copy` function should be resolved. The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
