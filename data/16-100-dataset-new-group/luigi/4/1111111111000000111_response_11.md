### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to an issue with handling the `columns` attribute when it is `None`. This is causing a `TypeError` and the GitHub issue suggests a potential fix.

### Error Location
The potential error is occurring in the following lines:
```python
colnames = ''
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
When `self.columns` is `None`, it causes the `TypeError`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by trying to compute the length of `self.columns` when it is `None` and expecting it to be a list. The failing test case demonstrates that the `columns` attribute is `None`, causing the failure.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
The bug fixing strategy involves following the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue, which is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. Additionally, the fix should handle the case where `self.columns` is explicitly specified but empty.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix for handling None or empty list
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the fix suggested in the GitHub issue, where we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to compute its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
