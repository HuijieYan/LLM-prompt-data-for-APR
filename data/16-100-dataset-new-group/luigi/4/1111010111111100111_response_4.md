The issue arises from the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is used to define copying from S3 into Redshift. The failing test, `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, is meant to test the behavior when `columns` is set to `None`. 

The error message indicates a `TypeError` because an object of type 'NoneType' has no length, which occurs at `if len(self.columns) > 0:` within the `copy` function.

The GitHub issue also provides a suggestion to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` which can be a possible solution.

To fix the bug, we need to add a null check for the `self.columns` attribute within the `copy` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a null check for `self.columns`, we ensure that the `len` function is only called when `self.columns` is not `None`. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue and the function should now behave as expected in the failing test case while also addressing the GitHub issue.
