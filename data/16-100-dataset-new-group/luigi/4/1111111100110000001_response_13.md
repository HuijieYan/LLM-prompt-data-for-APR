The error message indicates that the `self.columns` attribute is of type 'NoneType' and therefore cannot be checked for length using the `len()` function. This error occurs within the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class when it attempts to check the length of `self.columns`. The issue is that the `self.columns` attribute is being assigned a value of 'None' which causes the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is 'None' and provide an alternative way to check its length. We can modify the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not 'None' and then proceed with getting its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to check if `self.columns` is not 'None' before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is 'None' and the test should pass successfully.
