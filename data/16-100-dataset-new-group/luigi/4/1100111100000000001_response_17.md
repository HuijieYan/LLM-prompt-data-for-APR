The potential error in the buggy function is that the `copy_options` method is not being called correctly. It should be called as a method, but it is being referenced as an attribute.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy_options` method is not being executed, which means the options for the `COPY` command are not being properly set.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to call the `copy_options` method as a function by including `()` after `self.copy_options` to properly execute it.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
