The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the usage of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` within the `cursor.execute` method. The `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are defined in a different class from where they are being called. This may be a scoping issue.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are called from the correct class. Since `_credentials` is defined in a different class, it should be called by using `self._credentials()`. Additionally, `copy_options` is defined within the same class, but it should still be called using `self.copy_options()` to ensure proper scoping.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` are used to call the corresponding functions. This should address the scoping issue and ensure that the correct functions are being called from the correct class. This will allow the test to pass for the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function.
