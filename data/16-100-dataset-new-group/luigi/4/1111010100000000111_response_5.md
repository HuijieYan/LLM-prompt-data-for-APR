## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is part of the class `S3CopyToTable` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. The GitHub issue indicates that when `self.columns` is set to `None` to prohibit table creation, the `cursor.execute` line within the `copy` function raises a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

## Potential error locations:
The error is likely occurring due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which is not handling the case when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the conditional check for the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is `None`. This leads to the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` and the `len` function is applied to it.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. We can first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then proceed with checking its length.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the conditional check before getting the length of `self.columns` is modified to first ensure that `self.columns` is not `None`. This change addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
