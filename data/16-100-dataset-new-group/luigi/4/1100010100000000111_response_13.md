## Explanation of the Bug:

The buggy function `copy()` contains a conditional check for the length of `self.columns`, which is causing an error when `self.columns` is set to `None`. This is directly related to the GitHub issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", where it is reported that running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None results in a TypeError.

## Potential Error Locations:
The potential error in the buggy function is the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the conditional check for the length of `self.columns` needs to be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is set to None. The suggestion from the GitHub issue is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified conditional check
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` ensures that the code will only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not None. This addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
