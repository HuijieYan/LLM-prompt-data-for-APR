## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def _credentials(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def copy_options(self):

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):

        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:  # This line has been corrected to handle NoneType columns
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

Explanation for the bug:
The bug is caused by the buggy function not handling the case where `self.columns` is None, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a NoneType object. This bug was reported in the GitHub issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", and it was suggested to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The suggested strategy in the GitHub issue is to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This strategy will handle the case where `self.columns` is None, avoiding the `TypeError`.

The corrected function now checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, resolving the bug.
