The bug in the `copy` function seems to be in the `cursor.execute` call. The `copy_options` variable is not being called as a function, which should be done since it is defined as a function in the class definition. Additionally, the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, which is causing the `colnames` variable to be an empty string.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `copy_options` is called as a function, and handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by providing a default value for `colnames`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making these changes, the `copy` function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and call `copy_options` as a function, which should make the corrected version pass the failing test.
