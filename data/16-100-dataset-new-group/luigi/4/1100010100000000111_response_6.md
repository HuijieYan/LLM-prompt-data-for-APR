## Correction

The buggy function is the `copy` function in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. The issue is related to a bug in the `copy` function in luigi 2.7.1, specifically when the `columns` attribute is not provided, which leads to a TypeError due to `NoneType` having no length.

The potential error location is identified in the conditional check for the length of `self.columns`. The bug is caused by the function not handling the case when `self.columns` is None, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for the length of `self.columns` needs to be adjusted to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a conditional check is added to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This modification resolves the bug by handling the case when `self.columns` is not provided. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to add a check for the existence of `self.columns` before performing any operations or checks that assume its existence.
