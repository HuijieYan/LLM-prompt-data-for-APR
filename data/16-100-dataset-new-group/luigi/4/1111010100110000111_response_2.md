Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem lies in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. Specifically, the error is caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to change the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This way, we check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` that occurred with `NoneType`.
