## Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to execute a COPY command to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The function is using string formatting to build the SQL query, including table name, column names, source file, credentials, and copy options.

## Potential Errors:
1. String formatting can lead to SQL injection if not properly handled.
2. The use of string concatenation to build the column names may not be formatted correctly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug could be caused by incorrect string formatting of the SQL query, leading to errors in the COPY command execution.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use parameterized queries instead of string formatting to prevent SQL injection.
2. Use proper string formatting for the column names to ensure correct formatting of the query.
3. Handle errors properly and provide meaningful error messages.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ', '.join([x[0] for x in self.columns]) if self.columns else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
     CREDENTIALS %s
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        options=self.copy_options)
    , (f, self._credentials()))
```

In the corrected version, I've used parameterized queries for the COPY command to prevent SQL injection. I've also properly formatted the column names and provided the source file and credentials as parameters to the execute method. This should fix the bug and prevent any potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
