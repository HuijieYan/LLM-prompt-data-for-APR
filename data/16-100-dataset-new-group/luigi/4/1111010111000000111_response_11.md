Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the usage of the `len()` function on a NoneType object in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, which is causing a TypeError. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the `copy` function with `columns` set to None, which triggers the bug.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. We can update the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and is not None before calling the `len()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will handle the case where `self.columns` is None, preventing the TypeError when calling `len()` on a NoneType object.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` pass.
