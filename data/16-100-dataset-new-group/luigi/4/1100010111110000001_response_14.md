The bug in the provided code is due to the `copy` function not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the function tries to call `len(None)` which results in a `TypeError`. To fix this, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` accordingly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the `copy` function to handle the `None` type for `self.columns` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that case.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string. This will fix the `TypeError` when trying to find the length of `None`.
