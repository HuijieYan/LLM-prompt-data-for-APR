The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect generation of the `COPY` command SQL query. The `colnames` variable is being constructed to have an empty string value when there are no columns provided, but it is not being handled properly in the query construction. This results in an incorrect SQL query being executed, likely leading to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is handled correctly in the `COPY` command SQL query. If there are no columns provided, the `colnames` should not be added to the query.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    
    cursor.execute(copy_query)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a condition to check if there are any columns provided. If no columns are provided, the `colnames` variable will remain empty and will not be added to the `COPY` command SQL query. This ensures that the query is constructed correctly based on the input parameters.
