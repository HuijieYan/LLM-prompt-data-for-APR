The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `self.columns` being `None`, which results in a `TypeError` when checking its length using `len(self.columns)`. This error occurs because the code directly tries to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to retrieve its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This revised version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before generating the `colnames` string, effectively fixing the `TypeError` that was causing the failing test.
