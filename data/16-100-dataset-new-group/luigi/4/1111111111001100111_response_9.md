## The potential error in the buggy function
The potential error in the buggy function is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is not properly handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` and the buggy function is unable to execute properly, causing the failing test.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` properly. This is evident from the failing test where `columns=None` is passed to the function, leading to the TypeError.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This can be done by adding a check for `None` before trying to obtain the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, the function should handle it accordingly without trying to access its length.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # Other functions in the class remain unchanged

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for None before accessing length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the function now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None` and resolve the failing test.
