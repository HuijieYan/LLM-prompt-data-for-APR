The bug in the provided function is due to the use of placeholders in the SQL query string without proper formatting. This can cause errors when trying to execute the query.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to properly format the placeholders in the SQL query string to avoid any syntax errors.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )
    
    cursor.execute(query)
```

In the corrected version, we have created a variable 'query' to properly format the SQL query string and then execute the query using the cursor.

This should fix the bug and the function should now execute without any syntax errors.
