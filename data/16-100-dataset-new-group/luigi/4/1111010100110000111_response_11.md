### Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
The bug occurred because the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition was not checking if `self.columns` was `None`, which caused a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`. The GitHub issue confirmed this as the root cause.

To fix the bug, the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` should be used to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

The corrected version of the function incorporates this fix, ensuring that it passes the failing test and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
