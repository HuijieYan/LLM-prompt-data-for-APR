The bug in the `copy` function is likely due to the `self.copy_options` variable not being called as a function. The `copy_options` method should be called as a function in order to get the correct string value to be inserted into the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options` method as a function by adding parentheses after the method name.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` as a function, we ensure that the correct string value is obtained and inserted into the SQL query.

This should fix the bug and the failing test should now pass.
