The bug in the function `copy` is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is `None` or not. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` demonstrates this issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then proceed to get the length of `self.columns`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the bug should be fixed and the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass without raising a `TypeError`. This should also address the issue reported in the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".
