## Analysis:
The issue on GitHub indicates that the bug occurs when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None, resulting in a TypeError. The root cause is identified as a specific line of code in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.

Potential Error Locations:
- The line `if len(self.columns) > 0` is likely causing the TypeError when `self.columns` is set to None.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is set to None, which leads to the TypeError.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated condition to handle None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
