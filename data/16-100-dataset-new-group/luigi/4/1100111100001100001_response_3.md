There are a few potential issues with the buggy function:

1. The `copy_options` function is being called incorrectly. It should be called as a method of the object, like `self.copy_options()`, but it is being passed as a variable without being called.
2. The `_credentials` function is being called as a method of the object, but it is not defined within the class `S3CopyToTable`.

This leads to the following consequences:
- The value for `options` in the `cursor.execute` call will be the string representation of the function `self.copy_options` instead of the return value of the function.

To fix the bug, modify the code as follows:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the fixed code, the `copy_options` function is called as a method of the object `self.copy_options()`, and the `creds` and `options` variables will now contain the return values of the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions, respectively, instead of their string representations.
