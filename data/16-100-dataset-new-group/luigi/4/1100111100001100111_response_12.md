## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def _credentials(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def copy_options(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs because the original code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The GitHub issue also points out this exact problem and suggests checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.

### Fixing the Bug

The bug can be fixed by adding a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.

I've incorporated the suggested fix from the GitHub issue by adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`. This ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only accessed if `self.columns` is not `None`.

This fix addresses the root cause of the bug and prevents the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.

The corrected version of the function now includes the necessary null check, ensuring that the Redshift COPY operation works as expected, even when `self.columns` is not provided.
