The cause of the bug is the buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class. The bug is triggered when the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, as the function is not handling this case properly and trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` before calling `len(self.columns)` and update the code according to the suggestion in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` check, we ensure that the buggy function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and avoid triggering the `TypeError`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
