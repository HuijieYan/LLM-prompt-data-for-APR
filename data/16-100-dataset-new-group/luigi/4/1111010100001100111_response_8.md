## The bug
The bug in the `copy` function arises when there are no columns specified (i.e., `self.columns` is `None`). This causes the code to attempt to get the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the `TypeError`.

## The corrected version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code will only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, effectively fixing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
