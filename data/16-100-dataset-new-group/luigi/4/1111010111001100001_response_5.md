The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute. In the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None` when creating the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance. However, the `copy` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a potential error when trying to construct the `colnames` string.

To fix this bug, we can add a check in the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check for `self.columns is not None` before constructing the `colnames` string, and set `colnames` to an empty string if `self.columns` is `None`. This should handle the case where the `columns` attribute is `None` and prevent the potential error.
