The bug is identified as the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` in the `copy` function of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates that the `self.columns` is of type `NoneType` and it is being checked for its length.

The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is set as `None`, and when the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line is executed, it throws a `TypeError`. To fix this, the `columns` attribute needs to be handled appropriately, especially if it is `None`.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to include a check for the `None` type before trying to access its length, and to handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version includes a check for `None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`. We verify that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the check, thus preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
