The buggy function is the `copy` method located in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The purpose of this method is to define copying from S3 into Redshift.

The failing test is the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` method located in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file. The error message received from the failing test indicates a `TypeError` at line 356 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file, specifically when checking the length of `self.columns`.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy` method does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to check its length.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` method to check if `self.columns` is `None` before proceeding with the length check. If it is `None`, then `colnames` should also be set to `None`, and the `COPY` statement should be formatted accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = None
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames is not None else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the length check. If it is `None`, `colnames` is also set to `None`. The `COPY` statement is then formatted using the appropriate `colnames` value based on the check.

This corrected version of the `copy` method should now pass the failing test.
