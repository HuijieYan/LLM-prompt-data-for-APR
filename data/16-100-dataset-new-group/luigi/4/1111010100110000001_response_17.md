The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `self.columns` being `None`. This is leading to a TypeError when trying to check the length of `None`. The `copy` function should handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we will modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. We will also provide a default empty value for `colnames` when `self.columns` is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not None. If it's not None, we construct the `colnames` string as before. If it is None, we assign an empty string to `colnames` directly. This would handle the scenario where `self.columns` is None and prevent the TypeError.
