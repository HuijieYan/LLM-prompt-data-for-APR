In the buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class, the error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to check its length. We can achieve this by updating the conditional statement in the `copy` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the conditional statement to check if `self.columns` is not None, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when it's a valid list, thus preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

This corrected version should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub post and pass the failing test.
