To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None and avoid calling the `len` function on it.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is None, the buggy function tries to compute the length of it, resulting in the TypeError. This is consistent with the GitHub issue description, which suggests checking for `self.columns` to be not None before computing its length.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `copy` function by adding a conditional check for `self.columns` before attempting to use its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the conditional check for `self.columns` before using its length, we can avoid the TypeError that occurs when `self.columns` is None. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and allow the `copy` function to work as expected in the failing test scenario provided.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
