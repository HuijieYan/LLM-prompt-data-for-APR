1. The buggy function is the `copy` method in the luigi/contrib/redshift.py file. It is used for defining copying from S3 into Redshift. The `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` test in the redshift_test.py file is designed to test this function.

2. The potential error location is with this line:
   - `creds=self._credentials()`. The bug may be related to the use of role-based credentials versus key-based credentials.

3. The bug is caused by the `_credentials()` method not handling the case when both key-based and role-based credentials are provided. This results in a failure to properly use role-based credentials when available.

4. The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.role_credentials` is not None, and if so, using `self.role_credentials` instead of calling `self._credentials()`.

5. The corrected version of the buggy function above includes a modification to address the bug and handle both key-based and role-based credentials appropriately.
