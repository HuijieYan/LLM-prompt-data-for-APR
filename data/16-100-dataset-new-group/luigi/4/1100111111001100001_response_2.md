The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way the `copy_options` method is being called. 
The `copy` function is attempting to call the `copy_options` method as a property instead of as a method. This can be seen in the line `options=self.copy_options`, where `self.copy_options` should be `self.copy_options()` to correctly call the method and get its return value.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line:
```python
options=self.copy_options
```
to:
```python
options=self.copy_options()
```

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function should now correctly call the `copy_options` method and use its return value in the SQL query, which will fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
