## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
The original issue was caused by trying to check the length of a NoneType object, resulting in a TypeError. The solution is to first check if the `self.columns` is not None before attempting to find its length. The corrected code includes this check and will only proceed with finding the length if `self.columns` is not None.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will not throw a TypeError when columns are not provided, and it will pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
