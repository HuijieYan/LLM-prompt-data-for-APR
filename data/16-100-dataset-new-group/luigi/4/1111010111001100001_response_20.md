The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the `colnames` variable not being properly formatted when there are no columns to copy.

The `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string if there are no columns, and then it is used in the `COPY` statement without any validation or handling for the case when there are no columns. This causes the statement to be formatted incorrectly and leads to a failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for the case when there are no columns, and if so, skip the `colnames` part of the `COPY` statement. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,  # only add colnames if it exists
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Adding the `if self.columns:` check ensures that `colnames` is only added to the `COPY` statement if it's not an empty list. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
