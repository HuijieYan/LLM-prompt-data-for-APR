The potential error locations within the `copy` function are:
1. Using `logger` without importing it or defining it within the scope of the function.
2. Using `self.columns` without checking if it's initialized or not.
3. Using `self.copy_options` without checking if it's initialized or not.
4. Using `self._credentials()` without ensuring that it will return the correct credentials.

The cause of the bug is that the function uses several attributes and methods of the class without verifying if they are properly initialized or have valid values. This can result in runtime errors or incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Import the `logger` and ensure it is properly defined.
2. Add a check to ensure `self.columns` and `self.copy_options` are initialized before using them.
3. Verify the implementation of `self._credentials()` to ensure it returns the correct credentials.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# import logger
import logging

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... other code ...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Initialize logger
        
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for self.columns
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
        copy_options = self.copy_options if hasattr(self, 'copy_options') else ''  # Add a check for self.copy_options
        
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials() if hasattr(self, '_credentials') else '',
            options=copy_options)
        )
```

In the corrected version, we have added checks for `self.columns` and `self.copy_options` to ensure they are properly initialized. We have also initialized the `logger` and used it for logging. Additionally, we added a check for `self._credentials()` to ensure it returns the correct credentials.
