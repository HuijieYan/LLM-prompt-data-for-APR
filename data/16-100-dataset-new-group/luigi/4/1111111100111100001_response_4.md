The bug in the provided code is due to the comparison of `self.columns` with `None` in the `copy` function. When the `columns` attribute is `None`, the code tries to compare the length of `None` with 0, causing a `TypeError`. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This change ensures that the code will only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, which will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
