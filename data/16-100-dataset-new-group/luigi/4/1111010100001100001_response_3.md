The buggy function is the copy method inside the S3CopyToTable class. The function is responsible for copying data from an S3 bucket into a Redshift table. The function is currently failing to execute the copy command due to a formatting issue with the SQL query string.

The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the SQL query string in the cursor.execute method. The colnames variable is being formatted as a parameter rather than being included directly in the query string, which leads to an error when executing the query.

To fix the bug, the colnames variable should be included directly in the query string without using string formatting.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)

    cursor.execute(query)
```

In the corrected version, the query string is defined separately as the 'query' variable, and then the cursor.execute method is called with this query variable. This ensures that the colnames variable is included directly in the query string and will not cause any formatting issues.
