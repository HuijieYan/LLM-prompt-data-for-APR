The issue is that the function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. This is consistent with the failing test, which sets `columns` to `None` and then calls the `copy` function.

To fix the bug, we can simply check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If it is `None`, we can treat `colnames` as an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
