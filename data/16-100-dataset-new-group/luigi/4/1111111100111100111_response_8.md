## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Explanation:
The bug occurred because the original code did not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This caused the TypeError when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. The issue on GitHub also identified the same problem and suggested a possible solution to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.

In the corrected version, the code checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, and if so, it proceeds with the rest of the logic. The `if` condition has been updated to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle both cases where `self.columns` is not `None` and has a non-zero length.

With this fix, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test should pass.
