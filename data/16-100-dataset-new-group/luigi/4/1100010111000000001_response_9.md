The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the handling of the `colnames` variable, which is being formatted as part of the SQL statement but not handled properly when `self.columns` is empty. The test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` verifies that the `colnames` are being handled properly, and it fails because the `colnames` are not being set correctly when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is empty. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to use it to derive `colnames`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None and has elements
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` will only be populated if `self.columns` is not None and has elements, preventing the bug in the original function. The corrected function should pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
