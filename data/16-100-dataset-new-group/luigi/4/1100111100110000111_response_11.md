## The analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, corresponding error message, and the GitHub issue:

The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. The function is responsible for copying data from s3 into Redshift. The error message indicates that the code attempts to use the `len` function on a `NoneType` object, causing a `TypeError`.

The related functions `_credentials` and `copy_options` are part of the same file but different classes. They are called within the `copy` function but are not directly related to the error.

The GitHub issue mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation fails with a `TypeError`. The suggested solution is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` in order to avoid the error.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:

The potential error location is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where the code attempts to use the `len` function on `self.columns`.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug:

The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` properly. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to use the `len` function on a `NoneType` object.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:

The strategy for fixing the bug is to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to use the `len` function on it. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to use `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before using len
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
