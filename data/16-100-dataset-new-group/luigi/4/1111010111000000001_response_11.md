The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class does not handle the case when the `columns` attribute is None or an empty list. This results in a syntax error when trying to format the `colnames` variable in the `cursor.execute` method.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before constructing the `colnames` string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `copy` function will not attempt to construct the `colnames` string if `self.columns` is None or empty, preventing the syntax error that occurred in the failing test.
