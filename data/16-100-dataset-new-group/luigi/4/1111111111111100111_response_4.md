The bug in the `copy` function is that it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to check its length, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `None` type object. This issue was reported in a GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This change ensures that the `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should be modified to handle the `None` case for `self.columns` before accessing its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function should now handle the `None` case for `self.columns` before checking its length, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
