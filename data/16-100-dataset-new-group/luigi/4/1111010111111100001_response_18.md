The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line, where the length of `self.columns` is being checked without handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `if` statement to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This should fix the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` was `None`.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
