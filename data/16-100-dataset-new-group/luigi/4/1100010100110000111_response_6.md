The buggy function is the `copy` method in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates that the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` is raised at line 338 when checking the length of `self.columns`.

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides insight into the root cause of the bug. The issue suggests that the bug was introduced in luigi 2.7.1 and it is related to the conditional check for the length of `self.columns`.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code is attempting to check the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional check to first verify if `self.columns` is not None and then proceed with checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the conditional `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, it checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to check its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.
