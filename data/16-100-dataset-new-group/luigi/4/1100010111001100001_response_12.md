The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string, even when the `self.columns` input is `None`. This causes the `COPY` statement to have an unnecessary empty parentheses, leading to a syntax error.

To fix this bug, we should check if `self.columns` is `None` and only set `colnames` to the comma-separated string if `self.columns` is not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `colnames` variable will only be set to the comma-separated string if `self.columns` is not `None`, preventing the unnecessary empty parentheses in the `COPY` statement.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
