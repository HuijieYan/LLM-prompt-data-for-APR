Based on the error message and the given buggy function, it seems that the issue is related to the `self.columns` attribute, which is of type 'NoneType' causing a TypeError when trying to check its length.

The buggy function `copy()` is expecting the `self.columns` attribute to be a list, but it appears to be None instead. This causes a TypeError when trying to check its length.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is None and avoid trying to check its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we've added a conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that we only attempt to access the `len` of `self.columns` if it is not None. This will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None and allow the function to execute as expected.
