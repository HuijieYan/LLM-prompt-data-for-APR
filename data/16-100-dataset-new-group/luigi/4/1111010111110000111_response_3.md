### Analysis
The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This issue is reported on GitHub and a suggested solution is also provided.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` because it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a problem when trying to check the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The suggested strategy from the GitHub issue is to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to explicitly check if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
