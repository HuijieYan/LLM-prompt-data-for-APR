The cause of the bug is that the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object, and the buggy function does not handle this case properly. This is evident from the TypeError `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` in the error message.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` value of `self.columns` and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for None value
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the buggy function does not throw a TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
