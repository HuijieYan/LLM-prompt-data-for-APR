The bug in the `copy` function is due to the `self.columns` attribute being `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` in the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and avoid calling `len` on it.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only attempt to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, and the failing test should pass.
