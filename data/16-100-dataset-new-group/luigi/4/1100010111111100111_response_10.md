The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is checked for its length without first checking if it exists or is not None.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is None, the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0` results in a TypeError because the length of None cannot be determined.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be modified to first check if `self.columns` exists and is not None before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, the code now verifies that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, thereby avoiding the original TypeError.
