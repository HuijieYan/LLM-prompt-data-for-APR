The bug in the `copy` function is caused by trying to get the length of a NoneType object in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. The input parameter `columns` is of type None and should be checked for None before getting its length.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for None before getting the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is None, we can assume that there are no columns to copy.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length, avoiding the TypeError caused by trying to get the length of a NoneType object.
