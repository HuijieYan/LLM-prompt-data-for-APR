The bug in this function is caused by checking the length of a NoneType object, which is not allowed. The `if len(self.columns) > 0` line is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but when `columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError`. 

To fix this, we can add a check for None before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is None, we should handle it with a default value so that the code doesn't raise an error.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. If it is None, the `if` condition will evaluate to False and the code inside the block will not be executed, avoiding the `TypeError` that was previously raised.
