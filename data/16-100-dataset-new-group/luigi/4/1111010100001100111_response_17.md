The bug in the `copy` method is causing the Redshift COPY jobs to fail in Luigi 2.7.1 when the `columns` attribute is not provided. The issue is due to the following line of code:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

This line assumes that `self.columns` is always a list, which is not the case when it is set to `None`. To fix this, the condition should be modified to:

```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

This change ensures that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the bug related to the `columns` attribute not being provided should be resolved.
