The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is not properly formatting the `COPY` SQL statement. It is missing the function call for `self.copy_options()` and passing `self.copy_options` as the options in the `COPY` statement.

To fix the bug, we need to call `self.copy_options()` to retrieve the options and also update the formatting of the `COPY` SQL statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call self.copy_options() to get the options
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the options retrieved from self.copy_options()
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should now properly execute the `COPY` SQL statement with the correct options. It should pass the failing test provided.
