The potential error location within the `copy` function is in the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement, where it assumes `self.columns` has a value and tries to calculate its length without checking if it's None.

The cause of the bug is that when the `self.columns` attribute is set to None, the `len` function is called on it, resulting in a `TypeError`. This is identified in the GitHub issue, which suggests a solution to explicitly check if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement to explicitly check if `self.columns` exists before attempting to calculate its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is set to None.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before calculating its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
