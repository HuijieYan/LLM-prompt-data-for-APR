The issue stems from the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The problem occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

The cause of the bug is in the `copy` function, specifically in the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
When `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` because `None` does not have a length.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. 

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding `if self.columns and`, the function first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

With this correction, the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`.
