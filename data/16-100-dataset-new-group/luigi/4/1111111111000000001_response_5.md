The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class has several issues that need to be addressed. Here are the steps to fix the bug:

1. Analyze the buggy function: The `copy` function is responsible for executing a `COPY` command to move data from S3 to Redshift. It uses variables such as `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options` to construct the SQL command.

2. Potential error locations: The main issue is with how `colnames` is constructed and used in the SQL command. Additionally, the method calls to `_credentials` and `copy_options` do not match the actual method signatures.

3. Cause of the bug: The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of `colnames` when it is empty. The `colnames` variable is supposed to be an empty string when there are no columns, but it is not handled correctly in the `COPY` command construction. Additionally, the calls to `_credentials` and `copy_options` are not being used as methods.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug: We need to handle the `colnames` variable correctly based on whether it is empty or not. Additionally, we need to fix the calls to `_credentials` and `copy_options` to use them as methods.

5. Corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We check `if self.columns:` to determine if any columns are present before constructing `colnames`.
- We fixed the method calls by adding parentheses to `_credentials` and `copy_options` to use them as methods.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `copy` function should pass the failing test.
