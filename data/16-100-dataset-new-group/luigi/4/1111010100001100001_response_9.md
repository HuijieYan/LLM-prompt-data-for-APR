The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the SQL query construction inside the `cursor.execute` statement. The `colnames` variable is being constructed correctly, but it's not being used in the SQL query string.

The `colnames` variable is constructed using the values from the `self.columns` attribute, but it's not being included in the SQL query string. This leads to a potential bug where the columns are not being properly specified in the `COPY` command.

To fix this bug, we should include the `colnames` variable in the SQL query string to ensure that the columns are properly specified in the `COPY` command.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,  # Include colnames in the query
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the `colnames` variable in the SQL query string, we ensure that the columns are properly specified in the `COPY` command, which should fix the bug.
