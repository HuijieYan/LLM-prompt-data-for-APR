The buggy function `copy` is trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when calling `len(None)`. 

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for `None` before attempting to retrieve the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, then we can initialize `colnames` as an empty string to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check for `None` on `self.columns`, we can prevent the `TypeError` that occurred before and ensure that the function executes correctly.
