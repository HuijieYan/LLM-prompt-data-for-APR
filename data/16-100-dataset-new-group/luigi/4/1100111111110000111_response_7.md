The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. It is failing to handle the case when `self.columns` is None, resulting in a TypeError when trying to check its length.

The buggy function is failing the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `redshift_test.py` file, which expects the `copy` method to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. The error message clearly indicates a TypeError due to trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides additional context. It suggests a possible solution of changing the line within the `copy` method to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` which would check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

To fix the bug, the `copy` method needs to be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. We can use the suggested solution from the GitHub issue to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this correction, the `copy` method should now handle the case when `self.columns` is None without causing a TypeError. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
