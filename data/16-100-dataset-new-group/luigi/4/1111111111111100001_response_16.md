To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The error message indicates that the code is trying to call `len` on a `NoneType`, which raises the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional check to handle the `None` case for `self.columns`. Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified conditional check to handle NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the conditional check ensures that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to call `len` on it. This should resolve the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
