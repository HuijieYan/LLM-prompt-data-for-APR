The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is None, the function still tries to access its length, resulting in a TypeError. This bug prevents the Redshift COPY jobs from running when columns are not provided.

To fix the bug, we can modify the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This change will first check if `self.columns` exists before attempting to access its length, preventing the TypeError.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
