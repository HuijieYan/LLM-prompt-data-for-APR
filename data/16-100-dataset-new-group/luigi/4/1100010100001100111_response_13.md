The bug in the provided function is due to the check for the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is None. This causes an error when `self.columns` is None, as in the GitHub issue described. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, preventing the TypeError described in the GitHub issue.
