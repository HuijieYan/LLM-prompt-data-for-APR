In the buggy function `copy` of the `S3CopyToTable` class, the issue is related to the handling of the `columns` parameter. The buggy function tries to check the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

The related test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` from the `redshift_test.py` file is trying to test the behavior of the `copy` function when `self.columns` is `None`. The test is mocking the cursor and expects the `execute` method to be called with a specific SQL string.

The GitHub issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides a detailed description of the problem, explaining that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation fails with a `TypeError`. It points to the specific line causing the issue and suggests a possible solution to avoid the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the condition checking the length of `self.columns` needs to be modified to include a check for `None` before checking the length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then the length check should be performed.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified condition to include None check
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        # Check if self._credentials() and self.copy_options() need to be called separately and store the results
        credentials = self._credentials()
        options = self.copy_options()

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=credentials,
            options=options)
        )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. Additionally, we have stored the results of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` in variables before using them in the `cursor.execute` statement. This ensures that any potential side effects of these function calls are only executed once.
