The potential error in the `copy` function is that the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string if `self.columns` is None, which can cause issues when formatting the `COPY` SQL statement. The `colnames` variable needs to be formatted correctly even if `self.columns` is None.

The failing test is checking if the `COPY` SQL statement is executed correctly with an empty `colnames`. The bug is caused by the `colnames` variable being set to an empty string and not being formatted properly in the `COPY` SQL statement.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None and format the `colnames` variable correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By checking if `self.columns` is not None before performing the length check, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is formatted correctly even if `self.columns` is None. This should fix the bug and make the `copy` function work as expected.
