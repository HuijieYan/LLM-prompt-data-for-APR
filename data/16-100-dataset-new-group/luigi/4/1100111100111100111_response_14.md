The buggy function is the `copy` method inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is failing with a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). The related `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` test is failing due to the use of `None` for the `columns` parameter.

The `copy` method is attempting to create a comma-separated string of column names (`colnames`) using the `self.columns` list. However, when `self.columns` is `None` (as in the failing test), it causes a TypeError because we cannot perform the `len` operation on a `NoneType` object.

The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to modify the conditional statement to avoid calling `len` on `self.columns` when it's `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `self.columns and` condition, we ensure that the `len` operation is only performed when `self.columns` is not `None`, thus resolving the TypeError issue.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
