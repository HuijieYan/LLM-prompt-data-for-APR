## Analysis
The `copy` function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. It constructs a SQL `COPY` statement and executes it using the given cursor. The `colnames` variable is constructed by joining the column names from `self.columns`, and the `creds` variable is obtained by calling the `_credentials` method. The `options` variable is obtained using the `copy_options` method, and all these variables are then used to construct the SQL statement.

## Bug
The bug in the `copy` function is that it's not calling the `copy_options` method correctly. It should be `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`. This results in a mismatch between the expected SQL statement in the test and the actual SQL statement produced by the function, causing the test to fail.

## Fix
To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs to correctly call the `copy_options` method by adding parentheses to the method call.

## The corrected version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
