Based on the provided information, the bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the `self.columns` attribute being set to `None` causing the `len` function to error out. The failing test is related to a GitHub issue indicating that the `Redshift COPY` jobs fail when `columns` are not provided.

To fix this bug, the `copy` function needs to be modified to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before retrieving its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.

After making this correction, the `copy` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
