### Explanation:

The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The issue arises from the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the length of `NoneType`.

The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and is not `None` before calculating its length.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, continue with the length check.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified condition
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this modification, the bug should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test and address the issue posted on GitHub.
