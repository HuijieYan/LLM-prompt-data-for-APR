## Correction

In the provided code, the bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` statement, which throws a TypeError when `columns` is None. The fix involves adding a check for None before checking the length of `self.columns`.

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to find its length, avoiding the TypeError. This change addresses the root cause of the bug identified in the GitHub issue and will resolve the failing test.
