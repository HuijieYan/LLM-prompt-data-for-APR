The buggy function has an issue with the formatting of the SQL query in the cursor.execute() call. The colnames variable is being set to an empty string, which results in an extra comma in the query when it is included in the {colnames} placeholder.

To fix this bug, we need to check if colnames is not empty before including it in the query.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if colnames:
        colnames = ' ' + colnames

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table}{colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case when colnames is not empty and include it in the SQL query without adding an extra unnecessary comma.
