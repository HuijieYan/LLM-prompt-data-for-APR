## The corrected version of the function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
1. The bug occurs because the original code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The test case 'test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns' is failing because it is passing `columns=None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, and the buggy function does not handle this case properly.
3. The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the bug, explaining that the failure occurs when `columns` is set to `None` to prohibit table creation.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length when constructing the `colnames` string. If `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` will remain an empty string.
5. The corrected version of the function adds a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` before processing `self.columns` to prevent the `NoneType` error.

With this correction, the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and the failing test should pass.
