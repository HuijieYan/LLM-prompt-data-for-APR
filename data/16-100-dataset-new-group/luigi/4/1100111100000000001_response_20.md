Updated and corrected version of the given buggy function:
```python

        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
In the original buggy function, the parameter `self.copy_options` is being used without parentheses at the end, which indicates that it should be a function call. However, `copy_options` is defined as a function and should be called with `self.copy_options()`.

The corrected version of the function is updated to call `self.copy_options()` with parentheses at the end to execute the function and retrieve its result for the `options` in the `cursor.execute` statement.
