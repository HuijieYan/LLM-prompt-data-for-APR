## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue occurs when the `columns` attribute is not provided, causing a `TypeError` due to the attempt to get the length of a `NoneType`. The related function `_credentials` and `copy_options` are also used in the buggy function, but they are not directly related to the bug.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is not provided, leading to an error when trying to access the length of `None`. This is in line with the GitHub issue, where it suggests the solution to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we will modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is not provided. We will add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. If it is None, we will set `colnames` to an empty string, effectively skipping the `",".join` operation and the formatting of `colnames`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is not provided.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected version, we added a conditional check to handle the case when `self.columns` is not provided. If it is not None and its length is greater than 0, we proceed with formatting `colnames` as before. If it is None or has a length of 0, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This modification ensures that the `copy` function will not encounter the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.
