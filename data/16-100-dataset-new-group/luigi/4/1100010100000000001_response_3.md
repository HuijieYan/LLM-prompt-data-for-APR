The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The use of string formatting in the SQL query may result in syntax errors if the input values contain special characters.
2. The use of self._credentials() to generate credentials may result in incorrect or missing credentials being used in the SQL query.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the SQL query is constructed using string formatting, which can lead to syntax errors if the input values contain special characters. Additionally, the function may use incorrect or missing credentials when executing the SQL query.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and syntax errors, and to ensure that the correct credentials are used in the query.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
     CREDENTIALS %s
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        options=self.copy_options)

    creds = self._credentials()
    cursor.execute(query, (f, creds))
```

In the corrected version:
1. The SQL query is constructed using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and syntax errors.
2. The credentials are obtained before executing the query and passed as a parameter to the cursor.execute() method.
