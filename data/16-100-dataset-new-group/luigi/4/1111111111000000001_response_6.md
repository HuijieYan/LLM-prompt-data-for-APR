The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class appears to be failing because it is calling the `copy_options` function without invoking it properly. The `copy` function is trying to use the result of the `self.copy_options` function as a string to be included in the SQL query, but it should be invoking the `copy_options` function and using the return value instead.

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` function should be called and its result should be used as a string in the SQL query. 

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to get the options string
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the options variable in the query
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will correctly call the `copy_options` function to get the options string and use that in the SQL query, resolving the bug. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
