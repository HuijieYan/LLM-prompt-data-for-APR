The bug in the `copy` function arises from the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is set as `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the program raises a TypeError since `None` does not have a length.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this fix, the `copy` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
