## Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` may cause an error if `self.columns` is None.
2. The line `colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])` may cause an error if `self.columns` is None.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because in the buggy function, there is no check to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. The GitHub issue also suggests that the bug occurs when `columns = None` is used to prohibit table creation, which results in a `TypeError` due to the lack of a check for `NoneType` before performing operations on `self.columns`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check for `NoneType` before performing operations on `self.columns`.
2. Use the suggestion from the GitHub issue to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
