The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing the test due to a `TypeError`. The error occurs because the function is attempting to call `len` on `self.columns` when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to retrieve its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `self.columns and` before checking for the length of `self.columns`.

With this correction, the `TypeError` that was occurring in the `copy` function for `NoneType` columns should be resolved.
