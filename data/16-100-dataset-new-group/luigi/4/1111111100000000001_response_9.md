The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The use of self.columns without checking if it is None or empty, which could cause an error if it is not provided.
2. The use of self._credentials() and self.copy_options without proper error handling if they are not provided.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case where self.columns, self._credentials(), and self.copy_options are not provided, leading to potential errors when calling execute on the cursor.

To fix the bug, we need to add proper error handling for self.columns, self._credentials(), and self.copy_options to ensure that they are provided before using them.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # Other functions remain unchanged

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        credentials = self._credentials() if hasattr(self, '_credentials') else ''
        options = self.copy_options() if hasattr(self, 'copy_options') else ''

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=credentials,
            options=options)
        )
```

In the corrected version, we have added checks for the existence of self.columns, self._credentials(), and self.copy_options before using them, and we handle the case where they are not provided by using empty strings. This will prevent potential errors when calling execute on the cursor.
