The bug in the provided function is related to the handling of the 'columns' parameter. When the 'columns' parameter is not provided, it causes a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len().

The suggested fix in the GitHub issue proposes to check if 'self.columns' exists and has a length greater than 0 before performing the operation. This ensures that the 'columns' parameter is not None before attempting to get its length.

Based on the input values and the GitHub issue, it is clear that the bug occurs when 'self.columns' is not provided. 

To fix the bug, the 'if' condition for checking the length of 'self.columns' should be modified to also check if 'self.columns' exists before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and has length greater than 0
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will first verify the existence of 'self.columns' and then check its length before proceeding with the operation. This ensures that the bug related to 'NoneType' has no len() error is addressed.
