The bug in the given function is caused by the comparison of the `self.columns` attribute with `None` using the `len` function. 

The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which implies that `self.columns` is None when it is being compared with a length.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before comparing its length. If it is None, we should handle this case appropriately.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None before comparing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns` before checking its length. If `self.columns` is None, the condition `if self.columns` will be False, and the length comparison will not be attempted, preventing the TypeError.
