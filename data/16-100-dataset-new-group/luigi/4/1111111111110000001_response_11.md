The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The bug occurs when the method tries to check the length of `self.columns` to determine if it is greater than 0. This raises a TypeError because `self.columns` is None, and the `len()` function cannot be used on a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length. We can use an if statement to check if `self.columns` exists, and then proceed to check its length if it does.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to check its length. This change ensures that we avoid the TypeError raised when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.
