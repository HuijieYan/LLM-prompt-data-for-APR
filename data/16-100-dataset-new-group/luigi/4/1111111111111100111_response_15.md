The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which means the `self.columns` is of type `None`. This is consistent with the failing test, which sets the columns parameter to None.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. This will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding Redshift COPY failing when columns are not provided.
