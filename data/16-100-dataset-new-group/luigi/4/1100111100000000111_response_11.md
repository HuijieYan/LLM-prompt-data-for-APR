## Analysis
The issue on GitHub indicates that the bug occurs when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None to prohibit table creation. The bug arises from a TypeError caused by checking the length of NoneType object in the buggy function.

## Identified Error Location
The error occurs in the buggy function at the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The bug is caused by checking the length of self.columns without first checking if it is None.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by directly checking the length of self.columns without first ensuring that it is not None. This results in a TypeError when columns are set to None to prohibit table creation, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug is to first check if self.columns is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```
In this corrected version, the buggy line has been fixed to first check if self.columns is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when columns are set to None.
