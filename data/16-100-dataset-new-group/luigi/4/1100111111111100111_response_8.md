## Fixing the bug

The cause of the bug is that the `len(self.columns)` is being called without checking if `self.columns` is not None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensures that the function works properly when `self.columns` is None.

By implementing this change, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test should pass.
