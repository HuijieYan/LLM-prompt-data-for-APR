The issue is that the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when attempting to call `len` on it in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function. 

To fix this bug, we can add a check to the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We can set `colnames` to an empty string in this case, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError` and pass the failing test.
