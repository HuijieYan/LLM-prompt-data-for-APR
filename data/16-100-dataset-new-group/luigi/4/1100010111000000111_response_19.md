## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is failing when the `columns` parameter is set to `None`. The `copy` function is attempting to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None`, which causes a `TypeError`.

## Error Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function are the lines:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This is causing a `TypeError` when trying to access the length of `None`. The failing test is also confirming that the bug occurs when `columns` is set to `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
This corrected version of the `copy` function includes a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This modification should fix the bug and allow the function to handle the case where `columns` is set to `None`.
