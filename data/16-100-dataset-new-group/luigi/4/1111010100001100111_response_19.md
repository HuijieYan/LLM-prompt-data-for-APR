The bug in the provided code is that it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None, resulting in a TypeError when trying to get the length of None. This aligns with the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", where the root cause is identified as the length check on `self.columns`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before proceeding with building the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the code will first check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before attempting to build the `colnames` string, preventing the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
