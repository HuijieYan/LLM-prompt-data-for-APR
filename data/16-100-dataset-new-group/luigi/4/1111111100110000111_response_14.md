## Fixing the bug

### Analysis:
The `copy` function is intended to copy data from S3 to Redshift, but it contains a bug where it attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where it is `None`. This bug arises when the `columns` attribute is not provided, leading to a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of a `None` type object.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `copy` function, specifically at the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line should be modified to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where the function tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, as evident from the error message.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We can achieve this by explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### Note:
In the corrected version, the line `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` explicitly checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This modification ensures that the code does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, thereby fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
