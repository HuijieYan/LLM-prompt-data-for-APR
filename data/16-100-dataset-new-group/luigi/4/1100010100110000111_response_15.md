The buggy function `copy` is failing because it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This causes the error `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The GitHub issue provides insight into the root cause of the bug and suggests a possible solution to handle the `None` case for `self.columns`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to check its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to check its length, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
