To fix the bug in the copy function of the S3CopyToTable class, we need to address the issue of `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is None.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This causes an error when trying to get the length of `self.columns` in the buggy function.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to use it to construct the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before using it
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the code will now check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to use it to construct the `colnames` string, thus avoiding the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and make the test pass.
