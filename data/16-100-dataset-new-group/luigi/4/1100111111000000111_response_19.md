The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which leads to a TypeError when `self.columns` is None. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` aims to pass `None` as the `columns` parameter and expects the `COPY` statement to be formatted accordingly.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
In this corrected version, the `copy` function has been modified to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This change addresses the issue reported on GitHub as it handles the case where columns are None, preventing the TypeError and allowing the function to work as expected.
