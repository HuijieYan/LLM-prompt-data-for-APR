The bug in the provided function lies in the construction of the SQL query. The "colnames" variable is being used to dynamically build the column names to be inserted into the Redshift table. However, if there are no columns specified, the "colnames" variable remains an empty string, which leads to a syntax error in the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to check if "colnames" is empty before constructing the SQL query and exclude the column names section if it is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    colnames_sql = colnames if colnames else ''  # Check if colnames is empty and exclude if so

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames_sql} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames_sql=colnames_sql,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we check if "colnames" is empty and only include it in the SQL query if it is not empty. This should resolve the syntax error in the SQL query when there are no columns specified.
