The issue in the provided code is that the `options` parameter inside the `cursor.execute` call in the `copy` function is not being called as a function. This causes the failing test since it expects that the `options` will be an empty string.

To fix this bug, the `copy` function needs to call the `copy_options` function as a method by using `self.copy_options()` and then pass its result as the `options` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this change, the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` call will be set to the result of calling the `copy_options` method, and the failing test is expected to pass.
