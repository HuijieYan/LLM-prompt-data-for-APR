The bug in the `copy` function arises from the call to `len(self.columns)` when `self.columns` is set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError` because you can't perform a length check on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If it is `None`, we should handle it appropriately, otherwise proceed with the rest of the code.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will check whether `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length, and handle it appropriately. This should resolve the `TypeError` that was encountered in the failing test.
