The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error, which occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. This behavior is not intended, and it causes the COPY operation to fail when columns are not provided. The issue has been reported on GitHub and a possible solution has been suggested, which is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix the bug, the check for the length of `self.columns` needs to be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will check if `self.columns` exists and has a non-zero length before proceeding with the `colnames` variable assignment.

By applying this fix, the `copy` function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring, thus passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
