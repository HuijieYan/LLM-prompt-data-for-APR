The potential error location in the buggy function is the if statement checking the length of self.columns.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case when self.columns is None, which leads to the TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). This is consistent with the GitHub issue description, which also suggests changing the if statement to check if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length.

To fix the bug, we should update the if statement to first check if self.columns is not None before getting its length. This will prevent the TypeError when self.columns is None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
