## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before performing len() operation
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` condition checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This change ensures that the code does not encounter a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

The suggested fix aligns with the GitHub issue's proposed solution to change the if condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This modification addresses the root cause of the bug and resolves the failing test associated with the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
