## The cause of the bug:

The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is failing due to the following line:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

When `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` because you cannot perform `len()` operation on a `None` type. This is causing the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to fail with the error message:
```
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
```

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" also mentions the same problem and suggests a potential solution to check for `self.columns` before checking its length.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to change the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This change ensures that the length of `self.columns` is checked only if it is not `None`, thus avoiding the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function will now check for the presence of `self.columns` before attempting to get its length, thus resolving the `TypeError` issue.
