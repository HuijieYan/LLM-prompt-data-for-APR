```

By checking the code and the failing test, I see that there is a potential issue with the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition in the `copy` function. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` uses `DummyS3CopyToTableKey(columns=None)`, which sets `columns` to `None`. Hence, when the `if len(self.columns) > 0` is evaluated, it will throw an error since `None` doesn't have a length.

To fix it, I modified the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` so that it will only check the length if `self.columns` is not `None`. This change will prevent the function from throwing an error when `columns` is `None`.

The corrected version of the buggy function is provided above.
