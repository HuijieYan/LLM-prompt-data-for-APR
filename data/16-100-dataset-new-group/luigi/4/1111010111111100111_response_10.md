To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. If it is None, we should set `colnames` to an empty string, and if it is not None, we can proceed with checking its length and building the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        else:
            colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, we first check if `self.columns` is None, and if it is, we set `colnames` to an empty string. Otherwise, we proceed with the original logic to build the `colnames` string.

This correction addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post and will fix the TypeError that occurs when `self.columns` is None.
