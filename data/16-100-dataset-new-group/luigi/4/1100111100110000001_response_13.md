The bug in the `copy` function results in a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). This bug occurs when the `self.columns` variable is assigned a value of 'None', and the function is trying to check its length, which is not possible for the 'None' type.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the situation where `self.columns` is 'None'.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to use a conditional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not 'None' before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not 'None' before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is 'None', it won't try to get its length, avoiding the TypeError.
