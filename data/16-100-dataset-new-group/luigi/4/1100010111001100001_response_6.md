The buggy function is the 'copy' method in the 'luigi.contrib.redshift' module. The function is expected to define copying from S3 into Redshift. However, the current implementation seems to have a bug.

Based on the failing test and the provided runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug may be related to the 'colnames' variable. The 'colnames' variable is being set to an empty string if the 'self.columns' list is empty. This might be causing issues when formatting the SQL query for the 'COPY' operation.

The buggy function fails the test 'test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns', where the expected column names are empty, but the actual SQL query generated by the 'COPY' statement includes an empty 'colnames' string.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the 'colnames' variable is handled correctly, even when the 'self.columns' list is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we check if 'self.columns' is truthy, and only then construct the 'colnames' string. This ensures that even if 'self.columns' is empty, the 'colnames' variable will be handled correctly in the SQL query for the 'COPY' operation. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
