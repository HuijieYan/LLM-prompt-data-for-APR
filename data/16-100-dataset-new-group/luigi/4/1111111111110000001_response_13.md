The bug in the provided function is causing a `TypeError` due to trying to call the `len()` function on a `NoneType`.

The root cause of the bug lies in the `copy` function used in the `S3CopyToTable` class. Specifically, the bug occurs when the `len()` function is called on the `self.columns` attribute, which is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` because the `len()` function cannot be called on a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic within the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to call the `len()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calling the `len()` function, we can avoid the `TypeError` and fix the bug.
