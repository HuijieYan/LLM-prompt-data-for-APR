The bug in the provided function is that when the columns parameter is None, the function does not handle it properly and does not construct the colnames variable correctly. This causes the COPY statement to have an empty parentheses for the column names, which is not valid syntax in SQL.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the columns parameter is None and handle it by not including the column names in the COPY statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_statement = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    if colnames == '':
        copy_statement = copy_statement.replace("{colnames} ", "")  # Remove empty colnames from the statement

    cursor.execute(copy_statement)
```

With this fix, the function now correctly checks if the columns parameter is None, and if so, it does not include the column names in the COPY statement. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
