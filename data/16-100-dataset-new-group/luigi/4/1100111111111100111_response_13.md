The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition, where `self.columns` can be `None` causing a `TypeError` when checking its length. The issue has been identified on GitHub as well, suggesting a solution to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we can update the `if` condition to explicitly check for `self.columns` not being `None` before checking its length. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
