The bug in the function `S3CopyToTable.copy` is causing a TypeError because it is trying to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute, which is set to `None` in the failing test. This causes an error because `NoneType` objects don't have a length. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and avoid calling `len` on it.

In the corrected version, we will need to add a check for `None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we will set `colnames` to an empty string, and if it is not `None`, we will proceed with constructing the string as in the original function.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the code checks if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to construct the `colnames` string, preventing the TypeError that occurred in the failing test. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
