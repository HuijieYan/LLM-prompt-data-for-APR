The potential error in the buggy function is that the `colnames` is being set to an empty string, and then used within the `execute` method without checking if it's empty. This can result in an error when trying to execute the SQL query with an empty column list.

The cause of the bug is that the `colnames` variable is not being properly handled when it is empty. The failing test provides a situation where the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, which is a valid use case but is not being handled correctly in the `copy` function.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should check if the `columns` attribute is not None before deciding to construct the `colnames` variable. If `columns` is None, it should not construct the `colnames` part of the query.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
This version checks if `self.columns` is not None before constructing `colnames`, addressing the potential error.
