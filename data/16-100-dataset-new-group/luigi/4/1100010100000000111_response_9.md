##  Analysis:
The buggy function is the `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is failing when `self.columns` is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

## Error Location:
The potential error location is the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition, which is causing the function to fail when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition, as it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is set to `None`. This issue has been reported on GitHub, and a possible solution has been provided to handle this edge case.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The suggested solution on GitHub recommends changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This will ensure that the condition is only checked when `self.columns` is not `None`.

##  Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition has been replaced with `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This change will resolve the issue reported on GitHub by handling the edge case when `self.columns` is not provided.
