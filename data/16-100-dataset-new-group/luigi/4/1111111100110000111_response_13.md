## Analysis

The buggy function `copy` is supposed to copy data from S3 into Redshift, but it is failing when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because it is trying to call `len()` on `NoneType`.

From the GitHub issue, it is clear that the bug was introduced in luigi 2.7.1, and the cause is related to an incorrect condition check in the `copy` function.

## Identifying potential error locations

The potential error location is the following line in the `copy` function:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

## Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs because the `copy` function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is set to `None`. This check should be added to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs to be modified to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calling `len()` on it.

## The corrected version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` is used to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with further operations. This change ensures that the function does not encounter a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
