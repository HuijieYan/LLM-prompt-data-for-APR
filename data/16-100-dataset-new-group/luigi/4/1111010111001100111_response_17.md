The bug in the provided function is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to a TypeError when `self.columns` is set to None. This bug causes the COPY operation to fail when `columns` are not provided.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` exist and have a length greater than 0 before using it in the `COPY` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will first check if `self.columns` exist and have a length greater than 0 before trying to use it in the `COPY` statement, preventing the TypeError when `self.columns` is set to None. This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
