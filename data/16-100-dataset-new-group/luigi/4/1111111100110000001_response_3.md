The buggy function `copy` is failing with a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to access the length of `self.columns`. This indicates that `self.columns` is `None` when it is expected to be a list.

The potential error location in the `copy` function is the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
where it tries to check the length of `self.columns`.

Based on the error message and the context of the code, the cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute of the `S3CopyToTable` class is not being properly initialized, possibly leading to a `NoneType` value when it is accessed in the `copy` function.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that `self.columns` is initialized with a list even if it is empty. This will prevent it from being `NoneType` and allow the `copy` function to check its length without encountering the TypeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` condition first checks if `self.columns` is not empty (`if self.columns`), and only then proceeds to check its length using `len(self.columns)`. This ensures that `self.columns` is not `None` and avoids the TypeError. Additionally, the call to `self.copy_options` is corrected by adding parentheses to call the function.
