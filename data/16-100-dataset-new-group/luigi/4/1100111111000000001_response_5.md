The bug in the `copy` function is that it is not calling the `copy_options` function. The `copy_options` function is missing the `()` at the end.

The corrected version of the `copy` function should include the `()` to call the `copy_options` function and pass its result to the `options` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Corrected by adding `()` to call the copy_options function
    )
```

This corrected version of the `copy` function should pass the failing test.
