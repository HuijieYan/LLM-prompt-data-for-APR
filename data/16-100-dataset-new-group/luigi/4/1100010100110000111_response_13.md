## Bug analysis
The bug occurs in the `copy` function when `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `None`. The bug has been identified on GitHub and a potential solution has been suggested to address this issue.

## Bug fix strategy
The suggested solution on GitHub proposes to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This change will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
