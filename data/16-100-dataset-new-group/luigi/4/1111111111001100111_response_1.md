## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The `self.columns` attribute is being used without checking if it is `None`.
2. The `self.copy_options` attribute may not be correctly formatted for use in the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the `self.columns` attribute being `None`, which leads to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when the buggy function tries to use it to construct the `colnames` variable for the `COPY` statement. Additionally, the value of `self.copy_options` may not be correctly formatted to be used in the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to use it to construct `colnames`.
2. Ensure that `self.copy_options` is set to a valid string value before using it in the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (other functions and attributes)

    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        else:
            colnames = ''

        if self.copy_options:
            options = self.copy_options()
        else:
            options = ''

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=options)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `self.columns` attribute is checked for `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable, and the `self.copy_options` attribute is properly used to set the `options` variable for the `cursor.execute` statement.
