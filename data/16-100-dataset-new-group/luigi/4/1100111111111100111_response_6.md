## The source code of the fixed function
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def _credentials(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def copy_options(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the fixed function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    # this is the fixed function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed line, checking if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options))
```

By changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we can ensure that the program will only execute the code inside the if statement if `self.columns` is not None. This will prevent the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error from occurring when `self.columns` is None.

By making this change, we address the issue reported in the GitHub discussion, where running Redshift COPY jobs with columns = None to prohibit table creation resulted in a failure in luigi 2.7.1. The suggested fix aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.
