The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the `self.columns` attribute being `None`. This causes an error when trying to use its length in the `if` condition.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated condition
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `if` condition first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` and then proceeds to check its length, which should fix the issue described in the GitHub report.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
