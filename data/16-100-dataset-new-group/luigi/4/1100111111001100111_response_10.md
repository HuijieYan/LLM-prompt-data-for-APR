The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the use of `self.columns` without checking if it's None or not, causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`. This issue is related to a GitHub issue where the user is experiencing this problem and has suggested a possible solution to handle the `None` case explicitly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will now explicitly handle the `None` case for `self.columns`, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to get its length. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` passes successfully.
