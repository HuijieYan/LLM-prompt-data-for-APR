The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to a TypeError. This is occurring because the function is attempting to call `len()` on the `self.columns` attribute, which is of type 'NoneType' when the test is run with `columns` set to `None`. This results in a `'NoneType' object has no len()` error.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to take its length.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to take its length. If it is `None`, the `if` statement will evaluate to `False` and the code within the block will not execute, preventing the TypeError.
