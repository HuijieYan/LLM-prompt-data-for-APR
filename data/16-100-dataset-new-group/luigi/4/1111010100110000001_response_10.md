The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError`. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`. This is happening because the `columns` attribute is being set to `None` in the failing test case.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `columns` attribute is always a list before checking its length. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is `None`, and if it is, we can assign an empty list to it.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is None:
        self.columns = []
        
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Now, when `self.columns` is `None`, it will be replaced with an empty list before checking its length, thus preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
