The error message indicates a 'TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()' at line 356 in the copy function. This error occurs because the code is trying to check the length of 'self.columns', which is None, causing the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we should add a check to see if 'self.columns' is None, and if so, set 'colnames' to an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will now check if 'self.columns' is not None before trying to get its length, preventing the TypeError.
