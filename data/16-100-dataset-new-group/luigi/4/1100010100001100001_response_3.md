In the given buggy function, the main issue is the use of the `CREDENTIALS` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `CREDENTIALS` parameter is not being formatted correctly, which causes the function to fail when executing.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the formatting of the `CREDENTIALS` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement. We also need to ensure that the `self._credentials()` method returns the correct credentials in the expected format.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    credentials = self._credentials()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have assigned the result of `self._credentials()` to a variable `credentials`, and then used this variable in the `cursor.execute` statement. This ensures that the `CREDENTIALS` parameter is formatted correctly.

This should resolve the bug and allow the function to execute successfully.
