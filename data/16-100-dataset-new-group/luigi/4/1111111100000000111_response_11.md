To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it exists before performing operations on it.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` exists and is not `None` before trying to access its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when `self.columns` is not provided. This aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.

By making this update to the `copy` function, we ensure that the code is more robust and can handle the case where `self.columns` is not provided, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
