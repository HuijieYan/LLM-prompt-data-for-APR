The bug in the `copy` function is due to the comparison of `self.columns` with an integer in the `if` statement. When the `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` when comparing its length to an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before using the `len` function. If it is `None`, we can assign an empty list to `colnames` to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    else:
        colnames = ''

    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With the above fix, the `copy` function should now pass the failing test and avoid the `TypeError` caused by comparing `None` with an integer.
