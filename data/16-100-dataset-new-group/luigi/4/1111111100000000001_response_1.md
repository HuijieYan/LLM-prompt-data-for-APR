To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to address the following issues:

1. The `copy_options` method is being referenced directly without calling it as a method.

2. The `_credentials` method is also being referenced without calling it as a method.

3. The `COPY` command in the `cursor.execute` method is not formatted correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # calling _credentials as a method
        options=self.copy_options())  # calling copy_options as a method
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have called the `_credentials` and `copy_options` methods using parentheses. We have also corrected the formatting of the `COPY` command within the `cursor.execute` method. These changes should fix the bug in the function.
