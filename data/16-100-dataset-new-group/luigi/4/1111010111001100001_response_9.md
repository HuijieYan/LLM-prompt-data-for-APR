The bug in the provided function is the use of the `None` type for the `columns` parameter, causing a `NoneType` error when trying to access its elements in the `copy` function. The correct behavior should be to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and provide a default value for `colnames`.

Here's a corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its elements, we prevent the `NoneType` error that was causing the test to fail.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test.
