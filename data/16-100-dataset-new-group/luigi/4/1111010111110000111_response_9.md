The potential error location within the buggy function is the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The cause of the bug is that when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, the buggy function attempts to check the length of `None` which results in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the check should be modified to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This ensures that the length is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this correction, the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` correctly and should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
