The potential error in the buggy function is likely in the construction of the SQL query for the `cursor.execute` method. Specifically, there may be an issue with the `colnames` variable and the `COPY` command.

The cause of the bug is that the `colnames` variable is not being included properly in the `COPY` command. This might be due to an incorrect construction of the `colnames` string or improperly using it in the `COPY` command.

To fix the bug, the `colnames` variable needs to be included correctly in the `COPY` command.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition has been replaced with `if self.columns` to check if the `self.columns` list is not empty. This ensures that the `colnames` variable is constructed properly. Additionally, the `colnames` variable is now used correctly in the `COPY` command.
