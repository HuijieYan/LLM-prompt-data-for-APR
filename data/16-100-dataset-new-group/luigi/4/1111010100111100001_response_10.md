The bug in the provided function is caused by the `self.columns` attribute being set to `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to use the `len()` function on it.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and provide a default value for `colnames` if `self.columns` is empty.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check for `self.columns` before trying to use it in the `join` function. If `self.columns` is empty or `None`, then `colnames` will be set to an empty string.

This should fix the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` was `None`.
