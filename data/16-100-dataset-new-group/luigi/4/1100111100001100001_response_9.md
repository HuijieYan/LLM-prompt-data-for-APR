The bug in the provided function is that the `copy_options` function is not being called to get the options for the COPY command. This results in the `options` variable being assigned the function itself, rather than the result of calling the function.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to get the options and then use that result in the query.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to get the options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the options obtained from copy_options function
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `copy_options` function is called to get the options, and the result is used in the query. This should fix the bug and ensure that the correct options are used in the COPY command.
