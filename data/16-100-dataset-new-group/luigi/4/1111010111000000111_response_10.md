The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is failing due to an issue with how it handles the case when `self.columns` is None. This is causing a TypeError when trying to get the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function.

The test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is failing because it expects the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None properly, but it is currently not doing so.

The GitHub issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides a detailed description of the bug. The root cause is identified as a change in the luigi 2.7.1 version that led to the failure. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue suggests modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to address the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None properly as per the suggestion from the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will properly handle the case when `self.columns` is None, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
