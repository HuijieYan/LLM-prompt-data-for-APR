The bug in the provided function is caused by the `self.columns` variable being `None`, and the function trying to use the `len` function on it, which results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to use the `len` function on it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to use the `len` function, preventing the `TypeError` that was causing the failing test.
