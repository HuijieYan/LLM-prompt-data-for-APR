The bug in this function is likely due to the way the SQL query is constructed. The use of the `colnames` variable in the `COPY` statement might be causing issues, as it's being used without being properly checked for the presence of columns.

To fix the bug, we should check if `colnames` is not empty before including it in the `COPY` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(query)
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing the `colnames` variable, and then constructs the SQL query using the `colnames` conditionally. This should fix the bug and prevent any issues that were caused by the incorrect usage of `colnames`.
