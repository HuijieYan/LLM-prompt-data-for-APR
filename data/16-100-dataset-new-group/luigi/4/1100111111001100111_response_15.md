The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute. The `type` of the `columns` attribute is not being handled correctly, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the length of `self.columns`.

The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` provides the input parameters and expected values at the function's return, which helps us understand the bug. The input `columns=None` is causing the bug when the length of `self.columns` is calculated.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length. The bug has been confirmed in the GitHub issue as well, where a possible solution is suggested to change the line of code in the buggy function to the following:

```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

Taking into account the suggestions from the failing test and the GitHub issue, we can provide a corrected version of the `copy` function as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should now handle the `self.columns` attribute correctly and pass the failing test.
