## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue
The buggy function "copy" is part of the class "S3CopyToTable" in the file "luigi/contrib/redshift.py". The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when running Redshift COPY jobs with "columns = None" to prohibit table creation, it fails with a TypeError. The issue seems to be related to the condition checking the length of "self.columns" in the "copy" function.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error location within the buggy function is the condition checking the length of "self.columns" and the subsequent usage of "colnames" based on this condition.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where "self.columns" is None, leading to a TypeError when trying to get the length of None. The condition "if len(self.columns) > 0:" assumes that "self.columns" will always be a list or a sequence type, which is not the case when "columns = None" to prohibit table creation.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to explicitly check if "self.columns" is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError and allow the code to handle the case where "columns = None" without causing an error.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
