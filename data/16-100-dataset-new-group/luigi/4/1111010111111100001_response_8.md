The bug in the provided function is caused by the "columns" attribute being set to None, resulting in a TypeError when trying to check its length. The buggy function is failing to handle the case where the "columns" attribute is None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the "copy" function to handle the case where the "columns" attribute is None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding an additional check for the "columns" attribute to ensure it is not None before attempting to get its length, we can prevent the TypeError from occurring.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
