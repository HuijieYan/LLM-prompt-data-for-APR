## Understanding and fixing the bug
- The bug in the original `copy` function is due to the fact that it does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length. This can lead to a `NoneType` error in the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is specifically testing the case where the `columns` parameter is `None`. This indicates that the bug is related to how the function handles `None` columns.
- To fix the bug, the corrected function now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This prevents a `NoneType` error from occurring.
- By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and handle the case where `columns` is `None` appropriately.
