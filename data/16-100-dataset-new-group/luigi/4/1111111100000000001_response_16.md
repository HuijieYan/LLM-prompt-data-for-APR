## The corrected version

The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class has several issues:

1. The `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are called without the `self` parameter, which is required for instance methods.

2. In the `cursor.execute` call, `self.copy_options` is not called as a function, it is missing the parentheses `()`, so it is not being executed.

3. There is a potential SQL injection vulnerability in the query constructed using string formatting.

To fix these issues, the following corrections can be made:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    creds = self._credentials()  # Call _credentials method with self

    # Call the copy_options method with self and assign the result to options
    options = self.copy_options()

    # Use parameterized query to prevent SQL injection
    query = """
         COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
         CREDENTIALS %s
         %s
         ;""".format(table=self.table, colnames=colnames)

    cursor.execute(query, (f, creds, options))  # Pass parameters as a tuple
```

In the corrected version, the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are called with the `self` parameter, and the `cursor.execute` call uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
