To fix the bug in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file, we need to modify the conditional statement for checking the length of `self.columns`. The current code is causing a TypeError when `self.columns` is `None` because it's trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statement `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This prevents the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.

This change aligns with the resolution suggested in the GitHub issue, and it should resolve the problem reported in the failing test.
