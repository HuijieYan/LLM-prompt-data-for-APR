The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. The issue faced by the function is described in a GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The issue is related to a TypeError being raised when columns are not provided.

Upon analyzing the `copy` function in relation to the GitHub issue and related functions, it is apparent that the bug is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` when `self.columns` is None. This causes a TypeError to be raised when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` should be modified to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to first check if `self.columns` exists and then check its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the bug causing the TypeError when columns are not provided will be resolved.
