The bug in the provided code is that the `columns` attribute of the `self` object is being set to `None`, which causes a TypeError when the `copy` function tries to check the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(
    """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Now, with this correction, the function will check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length, avoiding the TypeError that was occurring. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
