The bug in the provided function is likely to be caused by the way the SQL query is being constructed and executed. The `self._credentials()` function is also being called as part of the query string interpolation, and the `copy_options` function is being used without calling it.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` functions are called and their return values are properly formatted in the SQL query.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    credentials = self._credentials()
    options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,
        options=options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have stored the return values of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` in separate variables (`credentials` and `options` respectively) before constructing the SQL query. These variables are then used in the query string interpolation to ensure that the correct values are passed to the SQL `COPY` command.
