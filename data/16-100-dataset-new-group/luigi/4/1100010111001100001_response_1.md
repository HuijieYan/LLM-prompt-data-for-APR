The potential error in the buggy code is that the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string, regardless of the input columns. This means that even if there are columns, the `colnames` variable will always be empty, resulting in an incorrect SQL statement.

The `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance has `columns` set to `None`, which means that the `colnames` variable remains empty.

The bug is caused because the `colnames` variable is not being correctly populated with the column names, resulting in an invalid SQL `COPY` statement.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and ensure that `colnames` is only included in the SQL statement when there are columns.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None`, we ensure that `colnames` is properly populated with the column names. This will result in a correct SQL `COPY` statement.
