### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function arises from the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` when `self.columns` is set to `None`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because the `len` function cannot be called on a `NoneType` object. This bug was reported in a GitHub issue, and the proposed solution is to modify the comparison to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should update the comparison to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calling the `len` function. This will prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when trying to get the length of a `None` object.

### Corrected Code
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (other helper functions)

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By updating the comparison in the `copy` function, we avoid the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, as reported in the GitHub issue.
