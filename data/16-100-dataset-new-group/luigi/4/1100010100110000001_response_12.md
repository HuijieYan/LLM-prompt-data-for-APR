The error is occurring at line 338 in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file, within the `copy` method. The error message is `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This error occurs because the `columns` attribute is of type `None` and the code is trying to apply the `len` function to it.

To fix this bug, we should add a check for `None` type before applying the `len` function to prevent the error. A simple `if` statement can be added to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to construct the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Add a check for None type
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the code should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
