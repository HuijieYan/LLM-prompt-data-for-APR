The issue seems to be caused by the buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. This function is called with a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance as `self` and a string `f` as one of its input parameters. Inside the function, an AttributeError occurs when trying to obtain the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.

To fix the bug, a check should be added to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `self.columns is not None` condition before attempting to get the length, we can ensure that the AttributeError will not occur. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and allow the failing test to pass.
