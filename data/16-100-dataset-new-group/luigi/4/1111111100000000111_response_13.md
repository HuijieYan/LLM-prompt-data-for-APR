## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is within the class `S3CopyToTable` which inherits from `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`. This class also contains the function `copy_options`, which is called by the buggy function. The issue on GitHub suggests that the bug occurs when `self.columns` is not provided, resulting in a `TypeError` due to a missing check.

## Identified Error Locations
The potential error location within the buggy function is the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the buggy function `copy` does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by adding a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # add a check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the line `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` has been added to check for the existence of `self.columns` before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
