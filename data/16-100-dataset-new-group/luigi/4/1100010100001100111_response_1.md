The cause of the bug in the provided buggy function is that the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a TypeError. This aligns with the GitHub issue, which indicates that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` fails due to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length, preventing the TypeError described in the GitHub issue.
