### Explanation
The error is occurring because the `columns` attribute is being set to `None` and the buggy function is not handling this edge case properly. The error message indicates that the buggy function is trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed the bug by checking if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the buggy function ensures that it only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
