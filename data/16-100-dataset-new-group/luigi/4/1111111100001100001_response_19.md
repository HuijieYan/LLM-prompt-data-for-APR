The bug in the `copy` function appears to be related to the use of the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` methods when constructing the SQL query for the `cursor.execute` call. 

The `self._credentials()` method is expected to return a string containing credentials, but it appears to be included as a method call without invoking it. This means that the query is including the string representation of the method itself, rather than the result of the method call.

Similarly, the `self.copy_options` attribute is expected to contain a string, but it is being included as a method call without invoking it.

To fix this bug, the `self._credentials()` method should be invoked to get the credentials string, and the `self.copy_options` attribute should be included as is.

The corrected version of the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # Invoking the _credentials method
        options=self.copy_options)  # Including copy_options attribute as is
    )
```
