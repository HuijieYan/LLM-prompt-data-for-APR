The buggy function is the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is intended to define the copying process from an S3 bucket into Redshift database. The bug occurs because in the `copy` function, the `columns` variable is used to define `colnames`, but it is not properly handling the case when `columns` is `None`. 

The `columns` variable is the input to the `S3CopyToTable` class. If `columns` is `None`, the buggy `copy` function fails to handle this case, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `None` type.

To fix the bug, a strategy should be to check if `columns` is None before attempting to join it to form `colnames`.

Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added an additional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This will ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if it is not `None`, thus avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
