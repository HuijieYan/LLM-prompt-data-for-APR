The buggy function is the `copy` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The failing test is the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `redshift_test` module. The error message indicates that a TypeError is occurring due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

The potential error location in the `copy` method is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in this case.

The cause of the bug is that when the `columns` attribute is set to `None` or not provided, the buggy function tries to check its length, which results in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Below is the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` method will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, preventing the TypeError. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
