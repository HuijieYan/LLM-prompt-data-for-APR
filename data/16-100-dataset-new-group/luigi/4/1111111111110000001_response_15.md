The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`. When `self.columns` is `None`, which is the case in the failing test, it raises a `TypeError` because trying to find the length of a NoneType object is not possible.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before applying the `len` function. We can do this by adding a check for `None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, before checking the length of `self.columns`, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None`. If it's `None`, the condition `self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` will return `False` and no error will occur.

With this correction, the `copy` function should now pass the failing test.
