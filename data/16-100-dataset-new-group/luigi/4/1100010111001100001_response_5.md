The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't handle the case when the columns parameter is None. This results in an empty colnames variable being passed to the SQL query, which leads to a syntax error during execution.

To fix the bug, we need to check if self.columns is None and handle it appropriately before constructing the colnames variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check for None in the self.columns parameter, and if it is None, it skips constructing the colnames variable.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
