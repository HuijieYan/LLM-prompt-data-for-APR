To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to address the issue where the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. It is causing a `TypeError` when checking its length.

The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to change the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
to
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `TypeError` should no longer occur when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
