The bug in the `copy` function is that it's trying to call `copy_options` as a function, but it's defined as a class attribute. This is evident from the call `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement. This will result in a `TypeError` when trying to execute the query.

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` should be called as a function by adding parentheses after it. Additionally, update `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` to implement the `_CredentialsMixin` class to take care of calling the `_credentials` function correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the buggy function with the bug fixed
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Call copy_options as a function
        )
```

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
