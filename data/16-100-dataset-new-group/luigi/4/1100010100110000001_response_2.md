The error message indicates a `TypeError` on line 338 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message specifically states that an object of type 'NoneType' has no length.

The potential error location within the `copy` function is at the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line attempts to check the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is `None` instead of a list.

The cause of the bug is that `self.columns` is `None`, but the function does not check for this condition before attempting to find the length of the list.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to find its length. If it is `None`, the function should handle this case appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a conditional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to find its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
