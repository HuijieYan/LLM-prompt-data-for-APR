The bug in the `copy` function is that the `self.copy_options` should be called as a function, not just referenced as a variable. The `copy_options` function is defined in the `S3CopyToTable` class, and it should be called with parentheses to execute it and get the result.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `cursor.execute` call to correctly call the `self.copy_options` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Corrected call to copy_options function
    )
```

With this correction, the function will execute the `copy_options` function and use its return value correctly in the `cursor.execute` call, passing it as the `options` parameter.
