## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

## Explanation of the bug and the fix

The bug occurs because the buggy function does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length. This causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is `None`.

The GitHub issue suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Therefore, the corrected version of the buggy function includes this suggested fix by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

This change ensures that the buggy function handles the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
