## The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The buggy function is using `len(self.columns)` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The use of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` without providing the correct method to call for getting the credentials and copy options may also result in issues.

## The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before using `len(self.columns)`. This results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, as seen in the failing test and corresponding error message.

Additionally, the way `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are being called may not be providing the correct credentials and options, leading to failure in the Redshift COPY job.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before using `len(self.columns)`.
2. Modify the way `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are being called to ensure that the correct methods are used to retrieve credentials and options.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # other methods here...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._get_credentials(),  # Call the correct method for getting credentials
            options=self._get_copy_options())  # Call the correct method for getting copy options
        )
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check for `self.columns is not None` before using `len(self.columns)`. We have also changed the way `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are being called to ensure the correct methods are used to retrieve credentials and options, which should address the root cause of the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
