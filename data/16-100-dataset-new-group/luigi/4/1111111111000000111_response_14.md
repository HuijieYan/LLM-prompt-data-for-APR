The potential error in the buggy function lies in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line is trying to check the length of self.columns without first checking if it exists or is not None, which leads to the TypeError when columns are None.

The cause of the bug is that when the columns attribute is set to None, the buggy function does not handle this case properly, leading to the TypeError. This bug has been reported on GitHub, and the suggested solution is to change the line to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This way, it first checks if self.columns exists and is not None before trying to retrieve its length.

To fix the bug, we should update the buggy function to handle the case when self.columns is None by checking if it exists and has a length greater than 0 before proceeding with further operations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By modifying the condition to check if self.columns exists and has a length greater than 0, we ensure that the buggy function can handle the case when columns are None, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
