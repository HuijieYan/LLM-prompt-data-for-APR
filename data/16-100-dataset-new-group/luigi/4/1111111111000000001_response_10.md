The potential error in the buggy function is that `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are not properly invoked in the `cursor.execute` function call. Additionally, the `options` parameter is not being extracted correctly from the `self.copy_options()` function.

The bug in the function is caused by not properly calling the `_credentials` method and not invoking the `copy_options` method correctly. This leads to incorrect SQL query generation and ultimately a failing test due to incorrect comparison between the expected and actual SQL queries.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_credentials` and `copy_options` methods are invoked properly and the `options` parameter is correctly retrieved from the `self.copy_options()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    creds = self._credentials()  # Invoke _credentials method to get credentials
    options = self.copy_options()  # Invoke copy_options method to get options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=creds,
        options=options)  # Use the retrieved options
    )
```

With this correction, the `creds` and `options` are properly retrieved from the `_credentials` and `copy_options` methods, and the generated SQL query will be as expected, causing the test to pass.
