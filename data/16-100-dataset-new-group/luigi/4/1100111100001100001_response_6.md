The bug in the given function is that the `copy_options` method is not being called properly. The current implementation simply references `self.copy_options` without actually calling the method.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method using `self.copy_options()`, and also ensure that the returned value is concatenated into the SQL query.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options` is replaced with `self.copy_options()` to call the method, and the returned value is concatenated into the SQL query.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `copy_options` method is properly called and used in the SQL query.
