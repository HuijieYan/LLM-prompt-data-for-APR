## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

## Explanation
The bug occurs because the original code did not check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length in the `copy()` function. This caused a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when columns were not provided.

To fix this, I modified the code to check if `self.columns` exists and is not None before trying to get its length. If it's None, the code should not attempt to get its length, preventing the TypeError. Additionally, the `copy_options` function should be called with parentheses `()` at the end to execute the function and get its value.

With these changes, the corrected version of the code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
