## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        # Update the format string to use credentials as a formatted string directly
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{aws_access_key_id}={key};aws_secret_access_key={secret}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            aws_access_key_id=key,
            key=self.storage._options['aws_access_key_id'],
            secret=self.storage._options['aws_secret_access_key'],
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
    
```

Explanation:
- The bug in the initial code is that it does not check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. This is the cause of the error when `self.columns` is None.
- The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to add a check for `self.columns` before accessing its length and to update the format string to use the credentials as a formatted string directly.
- In the corrected version, the code checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. It also updates the format string to use the credentials as a formatted string directly.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
