Explanation:
In the original buggy function, the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` occurs when `self.columns` is None and the buggy code does not check for this condition before getting the length of `self.columns`.

A possible solution mentioned in the GitHub issue is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length.

The corrected version of the function includes this change, adding a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before getting its length. This resolves the issue where the `TypeError` occurs when `self.columns` is None.

By making this change, the corrected function will now handle cases where `self.columns` is None and avoid the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
