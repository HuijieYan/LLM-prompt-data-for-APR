Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is due to the `self.columns` attribute being set to `None`. This causes an issue when attempting to manipulate it as a list in the `copy` function, leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. If it is None, we can handle it appropriately without trying to manipulate it as a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. This should fix the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

This modification ensures that the `copy` function handles the case where `self.columns` is None, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
