The bug in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is a formatting issue with the `colnames` variable. 

The issue is that when `self.columns` is `None`, it fails to handle it properly and results in an empty `colnames` value which causes issues in the `cursor.execute` call in the `copy` method. 

The buggy code doesn't handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and tries to join the column names without checking for its existence.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable is handled correctly when `self.columns` is `None`, and the `cursor.execute` call will work properly with the corrected query. This should fix the bug and allow the `copy` method to work as intended.
