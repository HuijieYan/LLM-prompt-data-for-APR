## Analysis

The buggy function `copy` is failing when `self.columns` is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This issue is also reflected in the GitHub issue description, where it's mentioned that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` fails in luigi 2.7.1.

The cause of the bug is the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0`. When `self.columns` is `None`, this conditional check raises the `TypeError`. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, which is a valid fix for this bug.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we will update the `copy` function to include the suggested conditional check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then the original logic to construct `colnames` will remain unchanged.

## Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
