The bug in the code is that the `copy_options` function is not being called in the `copy` function. This is causing the `options` variable to be an empty string, resulting in an incorrect `COPY` statement being executed.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function in the `copy` function to get the proper options for the `COPY` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options function to get the correct options
    )
```

By calling the `copy_options` function in the `COPY` statement, the correct options will be included in the query, and the failing test should pass.
