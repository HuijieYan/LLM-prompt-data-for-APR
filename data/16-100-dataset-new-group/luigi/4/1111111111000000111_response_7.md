## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Explanation:
1. The bug occurs because the original buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None, causing a `TypeError` when the length of `None` is accessed.
2. The root cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not check if `self.columns` is None before trying to access its length.
3. The GitHub issue points out the exact cause of the bug and suggests a solution to check if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length.
4. The bug can be fixed by adding a check for `self.columns` before checking its length, and also by calling the `copy_options` function instead of referencing it directly.

The corrected version of the function includes the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. Additionally, `self.copy_options` is now called like a function to ensure the correct behavior.

By making these changes, the bug should be resolved and the function should pass the failing test.
