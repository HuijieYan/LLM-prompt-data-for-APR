The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition, which is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None` or not. This causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is `None`. This is exactly the issue reported on GitHub, where the `columns` parameter is set to `None` to prohibit table creation but results in a failure.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # fixed condition
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function should now correctly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
