### Bug Cause and Analysis
The bug in the `copy` function is caused by not handling the case when the `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`. 

The GitHub issue suggests that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation fails, and it proposes a potential fix to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and avoid trying to get the length of `None`. We can use the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the suggested change and checking if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
