The cause of the bug in the `copy` function is that it's trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it's None. When `self.columns` is None, it throws a `TypeError` because a NoneType object has no length.

To fix this bug, the `copy` function needs to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. If it's None, then colnames should be set to an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, thus resolving the `TypeError` issue.
