The bug in the `copy` function is causing a TypeError when it attempts to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute, which is of type NoneType. The error message indicates that an object of type 'NoneType' has no len().

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. We can modify the logic to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to use it.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. This should prevent the TypeError that was occurring in the buggy code.
