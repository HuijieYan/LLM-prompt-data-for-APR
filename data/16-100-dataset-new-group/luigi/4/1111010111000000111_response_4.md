The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing because it assumes that `self.columns` will always be provided and will not be None. However, the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` explicitly sets `columns` to None and expects the function to handle this case correctly.

The cause of the bug can be identified from the failing test and the GitHub issue. The bug is due to the assumption in the `copy` function that `self.columns` will always have a value. When `self.columns` is set to None, the function encounters an error when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. This is consistent with the description in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This can be achieved by checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is None and should pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
