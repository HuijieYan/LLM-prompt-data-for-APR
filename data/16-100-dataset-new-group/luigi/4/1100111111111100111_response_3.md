The bug in the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a TypeError when `self.columns` is set to None. This is causing the Redshift COPY job to fail when columns are not provided. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. If it is None, we do not try to get the length, avoiding the TypeError that was occurring.

By making this change, the `copy` function will handle the case where `self.columns` is None, and the Redshift COPY job should no longer fail when columns are not provided.

This will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and the failing test, and the function should work as expected.
