The bug in the provided function is due to the usage of the `self.columns` attribute, which is set to `None` in the test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`. This causes the `colnames` variable to be set to an empty string, resulting in an incorrect format of the `COPY` statement in the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `colnames` will be correctly set to the list of column names when `self.columns` is not `None`.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
