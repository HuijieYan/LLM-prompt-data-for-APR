The buggy function is the `copy` method in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object. This error is being triggered when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. The corresponding GitHub issue suggests that the root cause is the usage of `len(self.columns) > 0` and proposes a solution to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to avoid causing a `TypeError`. We can simply check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
