The bug in the `copy` function is due to the `self.copy_options` being used as a function without being called. This means that the `copy_options` function is not being executed to retrieve the actual options. As a result, the `options` variable in the `cursor.execute` call is not being populated with the correct options.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to retrieve the actual options and then use the result in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to retrieve the actual options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the retrieved options in the SQL query
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now correctly retrieve the options from the `copy_options` function and use them in the `cursor.execute` call. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
