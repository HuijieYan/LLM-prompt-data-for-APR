The buggy function is the `copy` method within a class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates that there is a 'NoneType' object that does not have the `len()` method.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is `None`, which leads to a TypeError when attempting to get its length.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to add a check to see if the `columns` attribute is not None before attempting to access its length.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` statement now checks if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length, and the subsequent code inside the `if` block will only execute if `self.columns` is not None. This should fix the TypeError issue and the function should pass the failing test.
