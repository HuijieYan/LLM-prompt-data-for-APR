To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. The current code attempts to get the length of `self.columns` directly, resulting in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

We can modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix for handling NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` test passes successfully.
