## The potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error location within the buggy function is the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` because it is not handling the case when `self.columns` is None.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition in the buggy function `copy`, which throws a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is None. This issue is related to a GitHub issue where running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the condition to explicitly check for `self.columns` being not None before checking its length.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
