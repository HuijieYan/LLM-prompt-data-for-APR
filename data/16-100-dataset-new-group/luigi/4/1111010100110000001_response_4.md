The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, and the buggy function does not handle this case properly. The error message indicates that the buggy function is trying to use the `len()` function on a `None` type, which results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the conditional `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` will ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This should fix the `TypeError` that was occurring in the original buggy function.
