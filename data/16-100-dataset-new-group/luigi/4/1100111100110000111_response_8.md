Explanation:
The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when accessing the `len` of `NoneType`, which points to the condition `len(self.columns) > 0` as the potential error location.

The GitHub issue suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, which is the recommended strategy for fixing the bug.

The corrected version of the function addresses the bug by modifying the condition to check for `self.columns` being not `None` before checking its length. This correction ensures that the code will not attempt to access the length of a `NoneType` object.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
