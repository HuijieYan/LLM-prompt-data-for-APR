To fix the bug, we need to address the issue with the `columns` parameter not being handled properly when it is set to `None`. The bug causes a `TypeError` when the `columns` parameter is not provided.

The cause of the bug is in the `copy` function where it checks the length of the `self.columns` list without first checking if it's `None`. We can see from the GitHub issue that this bug was introduced in luigi 2.7.1, and the suggested solution is to modify the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. Here's the corrected version:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this modification, the bug should be resolved, and the `copy` function should handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
