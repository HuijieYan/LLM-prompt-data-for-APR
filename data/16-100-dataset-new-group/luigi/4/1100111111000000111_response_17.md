The bug in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function is due to the condition `len(self.columns) > 0`, which throws an error when `self.columns` is `None`. This bug causes the Redshift COPY operation to fail when columns are not provided.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` ensures that the `len` function is only called when `self.columns` is not `None`, preventing the error from occurring.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" by properly handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

The corrected `S3CopyToTable.copy` function will pass the failing test and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
