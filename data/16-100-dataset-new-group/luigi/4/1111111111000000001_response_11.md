The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is not correctly calling the `copy_options` method. It is missing the `()` after `self.copy_options`.

This is causing the `options` field in the `cursor.execute` call to be set with the method reference itself instead of its return value.

To fix this bug, we need to add `()` after `self.copy_options` to properly call the method and use its return value.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding `()` after `self.copy_options`, we are properly calling the method and using its return value in the `cursor.execute` call. This should fix the bug and make the `copy` function work as expected.
