### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the fact that when `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function tries to get the length of `None`, resulting in the error `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The GitHub issue identifies the root cause and suggests the solution of adding an additional check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length. The corrected version of the function implements this fix by adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

By applying this fix, the function will no longer try to get the length of `None` and will avoid the TypeError. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and will pass the failing test.
