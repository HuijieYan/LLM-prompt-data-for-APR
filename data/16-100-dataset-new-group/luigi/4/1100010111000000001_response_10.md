The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` fails to correctly format the `COPY` SQL statement. The test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is failing because the `colnames` field is not being set correctly, resulting in the SQL statement missing the column names in the `COPY` statement.

To fix the bug, the `colnames` variable should be set to an empty string if `self.columns` is `None`. This will ensure that the `COPY` SQL statement is formatted correctly even when no column names are provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string only if `self.columns` is `None`, ensuring that the `COPY` statement is correctly formatted regardless of whether column names are provided. This should make the test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` pass.
