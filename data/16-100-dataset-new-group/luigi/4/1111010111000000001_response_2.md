The buggy function 'copy' in the S3CopyToTable class is failing because it does not handle the case where 'columns' is None. The failing test 'test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns' expects the 'colnames' parameter to be an empty string when 'columns' is None, but the current implementation does not check for this condition.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if 'self.columns' is None and set 'colnames' to an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the 'copy' function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the 'copy' function will handle the case where 'columns' is None and set 'colnames' to an empty string accordingly. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
