The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the `columns` attribute being `None` and not being handled properly. This is evident from the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` where the `columns` attribute is set to `None`.

The `colnames` variable is being derived from the `columns` attribute, and since it is `None`, it is causing the SQL query to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and provide a default value for `colnames` when this is the case.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition is replaced with `if self.columns` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

After making this change, the `colnames` variable will default to an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`, and the SQL query will be constructed correctly. This should make the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` pass.
