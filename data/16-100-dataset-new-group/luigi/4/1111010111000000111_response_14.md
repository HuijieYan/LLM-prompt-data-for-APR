## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is located in the file `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`. The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, indicating that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` fails in luigi 2.7.1.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function include the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement, which can result in a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is `None`. 

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`. The failing test is mocking a call to the `copy` method with `columns=None`, which triggers the `TypeError` due to the unchecked length of `self.columns`. The GitHub issue suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to address this issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditional check in the `copy` method to first verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the check `if self.columns` before checking its length in the `copy` method, the bug can be fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
