The bug in the provided function is that the colnames variable is being set to an empty string before the SQL query is executed, which causes the SQL query to be formed with an empty column list.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the colnames variable is only included in the SQL query if it is not empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    colnames_clause = colnames if colnames else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames_clause} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames_clause=colnames_clause,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have introduced a new variable colnames_clause, which is set to an empty string if colnames is empty, and the value of colnames otherwise. We then use colnames_clause in the SQL query to ensure that the column names are only included if they are not empty.
