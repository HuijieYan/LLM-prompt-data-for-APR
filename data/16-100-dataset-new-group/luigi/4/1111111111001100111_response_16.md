The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to the `self.columns` attribute being set to `None`. This causes an error when trying to calculate the length of `self.columns`.

The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before calculating its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This fix will address the issue where the `self.columns` attribute is `None` and prevent the error when trying to calculate its length.
