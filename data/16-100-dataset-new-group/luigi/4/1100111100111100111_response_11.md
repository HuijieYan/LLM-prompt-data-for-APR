The bug in the `copy` function is caused by trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not `None`. This causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the line that checks the length of `self.columns` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`. If it is not `None`, then we can proceed to check its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This correction ensures that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, fixing the TypeError issue when `self.columns` is `None`. This should resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue and make the function run correctly.
