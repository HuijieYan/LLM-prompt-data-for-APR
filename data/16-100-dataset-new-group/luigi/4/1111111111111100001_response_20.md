The bug in the `copy` function is causing a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). The cause of this bug is that the `self.columns` attribute is None, and the buggy function does not handle this case, which leads to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If it is None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` before trying to get its length, we ensure that the `colnames` variable will be set to an empty string if `self.columns` is None, preventing the TypeError.
