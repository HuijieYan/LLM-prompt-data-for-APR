The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is being initialized as an empty string, but it is not being used in the SQL query if the `self.columns` list is empty.

To fix this bug, we should only include the `colnames` variable in the SQL query if it is not an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = "(" + ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns]) + ")"

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `colnames` variable will only be included in the SQL query if there are columns provided in `self.columns`.
