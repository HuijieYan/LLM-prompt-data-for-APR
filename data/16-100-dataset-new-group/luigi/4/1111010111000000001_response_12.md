Explanation:
The original code had a couple of issues:
1. The logger was being used without being properly initialized, leading to a potential NameError, so it needed to be initialized.
2. The condition to check if self.columns exists and has a length greater than 0 was not properly handled, so it was fixed to first check if self.columns exists and then check its length.

The corrected code addresses these issues and should now work without causing the potential errors.
