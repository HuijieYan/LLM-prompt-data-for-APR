## Analysis
The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing an error when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. This issue was reported on GitHub and the root cause was identified as a specific line in the `copy` function.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `if` statement checking the length of `self.columns`. When `self.columns` is set to `None`, it causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of it.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` statement to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then proceed to check its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can skip the rest of the logic related to it.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
