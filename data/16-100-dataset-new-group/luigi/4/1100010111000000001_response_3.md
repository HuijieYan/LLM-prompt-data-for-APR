The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to how it handles `colnames` when it is empty. When `self.columns` is empty, `colnames` is also empty, causing the `COPY` statement to have an extra comma at the beginning.

The test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` checks for the correct behavior of `COPY` statement when `colnames` is empty. It seems that the buggy function fails to handle this case properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to check if `colnames` is empty and handle it appropriately in the `COPY` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    # Check if colnames is empty and handle it appropriately
    if not colnames:
        copy_statement = """
         COPY {table} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
    else:
        copy_statement = """
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)

    cursor.execute(copy_statement)
```

With this correction, the `COPY` statement will now handle the case when `colnames` is empty correctly, and the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass successfully.
