The bug in the `copy` function is that `self.copy_options` is being called as a function, but it is defined as a method. This means that the `copy_options` method is not being executed, and instead the method object itself is being used as a string in the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method and use its return value in the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# this is the fixed copy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options method to get the options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the options obtained from copy_options
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `copy_options` method is called using `self.copy_options()` and the return value is stored in the `options` variable, which is then used in the SQL query. This ensures that the correct options are used for the `COPY` command in the Redshift database.
