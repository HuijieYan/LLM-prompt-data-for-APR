The cause of the bug is that the `self.columns` variable is of type `None`, causing the program to throw a `TypeError` when attempting to call `len()` on it.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition `if self.columns is not None` to determine whether to construct the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This should fix the `TypeError` issue.
