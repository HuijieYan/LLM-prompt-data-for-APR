To fix the bug, we need to account for the possibility of `self.columns` being `None` in the `copy` function. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The change made is on this line:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This change ensures that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to check its length.

With this change, the function is now able to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and it should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
