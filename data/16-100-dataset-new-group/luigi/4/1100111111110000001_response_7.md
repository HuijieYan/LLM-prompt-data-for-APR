The bug in the `copy` function is causing a TypeError when the `len()` function tries to operate on a `NoneType` object. This occurs when the `self.columns` object is `None` and the function is checking its length.

The bug is in the following line of code:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to check if `self.columns` is `None` first before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function which includes the fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
