To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to update the condition for checking the length of `self.columns`. Based on the GitHub issue, the bug occurs when `columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The suggested solution is to update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated condition
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This version includes the suggested condition to check for the existence of `self.columns` before attempting to find its length.

With this change, the `copy` function should now handle the case where `columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
