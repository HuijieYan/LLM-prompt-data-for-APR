The bug in the provided function is that the `copy_options` function is not being called before being used in the `cursor.execute` statement. This is causing the `options` variable to be a reference to the `copy_options` function instead of its return value.

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` function should be called and its return value should be assigned to the `options` variable before using it in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function and assign its return value to options
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the options variable instead of the copy_options function
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will be called to get its return value, which will then be used in the `cursor.execute` statement. This will address the bug and ensure that the correct options are used for the copy operation.
