To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to address the issue with the `self.columns` attribute being `None`. This causes the `len(self.columns)` to raise a `TypeError`.

The fix involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is not `None`, then we proceed with getting its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length and construct the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable will remain an empty string.

This modification ensures that the `TypeError` caused by `self.columns` being `None` is handled, and the function should now work as expected, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
