## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected copy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
1. The issue arises from the fact that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code attempts to get the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
2. The original code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue suggests adding a check for `self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to avoid getting length of `None`.
4. The corrected version of the function includes this additional check to prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix should address the bug and resolve the reported issue in GitHub.
