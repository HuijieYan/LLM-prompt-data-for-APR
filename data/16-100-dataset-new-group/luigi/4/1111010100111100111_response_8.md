The bug in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition when `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this modification, the condition checks if `self.columns` exists and is not `None` before trying to find its length.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
