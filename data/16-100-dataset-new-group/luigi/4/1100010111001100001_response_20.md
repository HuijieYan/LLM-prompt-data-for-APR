The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case when the columns are None. This causes the colnames variable to remain an empty string, which leads to an extra comma being added in the generated SQL statement.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the self.columns is None and handle it accordingly to avoid the extra comma in the SQL statement.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # check if columns are not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case when the columns are None and generate the correct SQL statement without the extra comma.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
