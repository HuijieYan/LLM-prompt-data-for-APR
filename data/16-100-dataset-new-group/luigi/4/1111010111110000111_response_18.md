To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, we need to update the condition that checks for the length of `self.columns` to also check if `self.columns` is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that the `len` function is not called on a `NoneType` object, which was causing the TypeError in the failing test. This change aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue to update the condition.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
