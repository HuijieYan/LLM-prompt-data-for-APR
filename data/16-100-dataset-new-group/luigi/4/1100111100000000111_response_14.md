Based on the GitHub issue and the provided code, it seems that the bug is caused by the `len(self.columns)` check when `self.columns` is set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `self.columns` before trying to get the length of it. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we proceed with extracting the column names; otherwise, we set `colnames` to an empty string.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
