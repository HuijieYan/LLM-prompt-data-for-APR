The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute. In the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, which means that `self.columns` is likely being interpreted as `None` within the `copy` function, leading to an error when trying to access its length.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `columns` attribute is properly handled in the `copy` function, even if it is set to `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. This change ensures that we don't encounter errors when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

With this fix, the `copy` function should now handle the `columns` attribute properly and pass the failing test.
