## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the fixed function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the fixed function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed: added parentheses to call the function
        )
```

### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is that the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly. The original code tries to call `copy_options` as a method without parentheses, which results in a reference to the function object rather than a function call.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by adding parentheses to call the `copy_options` function.

### Changes made to the original code:
- Added parentheses after `self.copy_options` to call the function: `options=self.copy_options()`

The corrected version of the function is provided above.
