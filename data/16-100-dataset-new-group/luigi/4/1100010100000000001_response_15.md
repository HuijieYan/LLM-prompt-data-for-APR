    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""

    )
```

The potential error location within the buggy function is the usage of the `self._credentials()` method. If this method is not returning the correct credentials, it can cause the COPY command to fail.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the `self._credentials()` method not returning the correct credentials, which can lead to the COPY command to fail.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `self._credentials()` method is correctly implemented and returns the expected credentials. Additionally, the `source` variable should be validated to ensure it contains the correct file path from s3.

The corrected version is provided above. After ensuring that the `self._credentials()` method returns the correct credentials, and validating the `source` variable, the bug should be fixed.
