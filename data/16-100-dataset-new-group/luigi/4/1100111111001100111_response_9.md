## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

Explanation:
The bug occurs because the code does not check whether self.columns is None before trying to access its length. This causes a TypeError when self.columns is None.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that self.columns is not None before checking its length.

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we first check if self.columns is not None before attempting to access its length. If self.columns is None, then the condition `len(self.columns) > 0` will not be evaluated, preventing the TypeError from occurring.

The corrected version of the function includes this check and should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
