### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. It calls the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions from the same file and class.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` checks for the proper execution of the `COPY` statement within the `copy` function.

### Bug Identification:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
The failing test and the GitHub issue provide insights into the cause of the bug. The `columns=None` setting is meant to prohibit table creation, but the `copy` function does not handle this case, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We should also consider the provided fix in the GitHub issue, which suggests checking for the existence of `self.columns` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns` before checking its length, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and pass the failing test.
