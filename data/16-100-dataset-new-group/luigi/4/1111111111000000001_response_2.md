The cause of the bug is that the `colnames` variable is not being properly formatted when it is empty due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check. This check causes the `colnames` variable to not be set, resulting in an improperly formatted SQL query in the `cursor.execute` call.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is always defined, even if it is empty.

Here's a corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns]) if self.columns else ''
    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use a ternary conditional expression to set `colnames` and format it appropriately even when it is empty. This ensures that the SQL query will always be properly formatted.
