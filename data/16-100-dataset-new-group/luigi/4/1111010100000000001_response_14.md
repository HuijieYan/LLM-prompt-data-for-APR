The potential error in the `copy` function is related to the formatting of the `COPY` SQL command and the usage of the `cursor` object.

The bug in the `copy` function is that it is not correctly using the `cursor` to execute the SQL command, and also the string formatting in the SQL command is not properly implemented.

The cause of this bug is that the `cursor` object is not being used to execute the SQL command, and the string formatting in the `cursor.execute` method is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to properly use the `cursor` object to execute the SQL command, and also correctly implement the string formatting in the `cursor.execute` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    sql = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    
    cursor.execute(sql)
```
In the corrected version, the SQL command is properly formatted as a string and then executed using the `cursor` object. This should fix the bug in the original `copy` function.
