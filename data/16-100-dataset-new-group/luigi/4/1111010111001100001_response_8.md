The buggy function `copy` is not handling the scenario when the `columns` attribute is None. This causes the `colnames` variable to be an empty string, which is not handled properly when constructing the SQL statement.

The fix for this bug is to check if `self.columns` is None and handle it accordingly. If `self.columns` is not None, then we should construct the `colnames` variable as before. If `self.columns` is None, then we should set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `colnames` variable will be set to an empty string when `self.columns` is None, and the SQL statement will be constructed correctly, passing the failing test.
