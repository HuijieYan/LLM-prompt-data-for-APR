The error message indicates a 'TypeError' due to an attempt to get the length of a 'NoneType' object in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the 'luigi/contrib/redshift.py' file.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is None. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. If it is None, we should handle it appropriately to prevent the `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length. This prevents the `TypeError` and ensures that the function handles the case where `self.columns` is None.
