The bug in the `copy` function is that it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None, which causes the `len` function to fail with a TypeError. This bug is related to the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The issue describes that running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None fails with a TypeError due to the root cause identified in the pull request https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/2245/files#diff-778ea3db4cccaf4de6564889c5eb670fR338. The suggested solution is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None and avoid calling the `len` function on a NoneType object.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This change addresses the bug identified in the GitHub issue and ensures that the `copy` function can handle the absence of columns without raising a TypeError.
