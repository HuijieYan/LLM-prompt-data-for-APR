The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing with a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is `None`. The `copy_options` method is called without parentheses, which means it is not being executed and is instead being passed as an object reference.

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` method should be called by adding parentheses. Also, it should be checked if `self.columns` is not None before trying to check its length.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test.
