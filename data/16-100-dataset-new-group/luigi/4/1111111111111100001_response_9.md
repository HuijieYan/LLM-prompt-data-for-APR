The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to check the length of `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before performing the length check.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `self.columns` before checking its length. This ensures that if `self.columns` is `None`, we don't try to access its length, thereby avoiding the `TypeError`. Additionally, we also corrected the call to `self.copy_options` by adding parentheses to call the method.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test.
