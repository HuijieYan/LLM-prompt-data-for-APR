The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing when the `columns` attribute is `None`. This causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The issue has been reported on GitHub and a suggested fix is to modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

To fix the bug, we should update the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`. This should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
