### Updated/Created Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated condition
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
The root cause of the bug is that the original function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This causes the function to throw a TypeError when trying to check the length of a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, I updated the condition inside the `copy` function to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to check its length. This ensures that if `self.columns` is None, the length check will be skipped and the function will not throw an error.

By making this change, the function will now correctly handle cases where `self.columns` is None, allowing it to pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.

The updated version of the function adds the condition "if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0" to prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

This version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
