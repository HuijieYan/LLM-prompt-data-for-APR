The bug in the `copy` function is the incorrect usage of the `copy_options` variable. In the `cursor.execute` call, `self.copy_options` should be invoked as a function `self.copy_options()` instead of being used as a variable. This is causing the `options` placeholder in the SQL string to be replaced with the string representation of the function `self.copy_options` instead of its return value.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that `self.copy_options` is invoked as a function to obtain its return value before it is used in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Invoke self.copy_options as a function to obtain its return value
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options  # Use the return value of self.copy_options
    )
)
```

By making this correction, the `copy` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test.
