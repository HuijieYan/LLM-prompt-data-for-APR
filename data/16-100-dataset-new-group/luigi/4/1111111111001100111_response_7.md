The potential error in the buggy code is in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is None, which leads to a TypeError when trying to access the length of a NoneType object. This causes the Redshift COPY job to fail when columns are not provided.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now handle cases where `self.columns` is None. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the Redshift COPY job does not fail when columns are not provided.
