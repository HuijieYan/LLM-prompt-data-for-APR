To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is set to `None`. The `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error occurs because the code does not handle this case properly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to compute its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.

With this change, the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and the bug should be fixed.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
