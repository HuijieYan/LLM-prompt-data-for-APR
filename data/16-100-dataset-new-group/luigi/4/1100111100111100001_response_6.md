The bug in the provided function is caused by the comparison of the `self.columns` attribute with `None`. The error message indicates that the `self.columns` attribute is of type `NoneType` and doesn't have a length, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to apply the `len()` function to it.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `if` condition to check for the existence of `self.columns` before trying to retrieve its length. This can be done using the `if self.columns is not None` condition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check for existence of self.columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
