    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,

    )
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it doesn't handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`. The GitHub issue provides a clear explanation of the problem and a suggested solution.

The suggested solution is to change the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

This change checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, which prevents the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

By implementing this change, the corrected version of the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is None and avoid the `TypeError` issue.
