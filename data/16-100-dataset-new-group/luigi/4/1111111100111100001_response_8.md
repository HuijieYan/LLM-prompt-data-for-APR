The bug in the provided function is causing a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). This is happening because the buggy function is trying to check the length of the 'columns' attribute, but the 'columns' attribute is set to None.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the 'columns' attribute is None before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to see if the 'columns' attribute is not None before trying to get its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
