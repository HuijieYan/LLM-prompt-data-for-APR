The issue with the `copy` function is that it assumes `self.columns` is always a non-empty list, leading to a failure when it is actually `None`. This happens because the `copy` function constructs the `colnames` variable by joining the column names from `self.columns`, but it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. 

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before constructing `colnames`, and provide a default value for `colnames` when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and only then proceed to construct `colnames` by joining the column names. If `self.columns` is `None`, we provide a default empty string for `colnames`.

With this fix, the `copy` function will be able to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing an exception.
