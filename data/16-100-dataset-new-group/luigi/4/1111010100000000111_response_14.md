The buggy function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an issue when the `columns` attribute is not provided. The bug results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when attempting to execute the `COPY` command.

The bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition, which assumes that `self.columns` is always present and not None.

To fix this bug, the condition should be changed to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, which first checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the bug causing the `TypeError` when `columns` is not provided should be resolved.
