The bug in the `copy` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This causes an error when trying to construct the `colnames` variable using a for loop on `self.columns`.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is None, and if so, set `colnames` to an empty string to prevent the error.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will handle the case when `self.columns` is None and construct the `colnames` variable correctly. It should now pass the failing test.
