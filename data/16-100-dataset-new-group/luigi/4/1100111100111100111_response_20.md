The bug in the `copy` function arises from attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying that it is not `None`. The error message "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" indicates a problem with the `self.columns` variable being of type `NoneType`. This is consistent with the input parameter `self` having a value of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey(table=dummy_table, columns=null)` where `columns` is set to `null`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to obtain its length. We can modify the line "if len(self.columns) > 0:" to "if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:" to ensure that we are only checking the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Added check for self.columns not being None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function should now handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a TypeError. This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
