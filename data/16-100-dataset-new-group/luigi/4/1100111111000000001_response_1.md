## Potential errors in the buggy function

1. The use of self._credentials() without being called as a method.
2. The use of self.copy_options without being called as a method.
3. In the cursor.execute() method, the options should be passed as a string, not as a method.

## Cause of the bug

The bug exists because the _credentials and copy_options functions are not being called as methods. As a result, the credentials and options are not being retrieved properly, causing the test to fail.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the _credentials and copy_options functions should be called as methods of the current class. Additionally, the options should be retrieved correctly and passed as strings in the cursor.execute() method.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
