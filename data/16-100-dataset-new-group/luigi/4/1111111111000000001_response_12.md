The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is caused by the incorrect use of the `self.copy_options` method call in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `copy_options` method is not being called correctly within the `cursor.execute` statement in the `copy` function, which leads to an error when trying to execute the SQL statement for copying data from S3 to Redshift.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` method is properly called within the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, the `copy_options` method is being called with parentheses, `self.copy_options()`, to properly execute the method and pass the resulting value to the `cursor.execute` statement. This should fix the bug.
