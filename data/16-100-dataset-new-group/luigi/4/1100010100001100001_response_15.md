The cause of the bug in the provided function is that the `source` parameter is being formatted with single quotes, which will result in an error when executing the SQL query.

To fix this bug, the `source` parameter should be formatted without single quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from {source}
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `source` parameter is no longer wrapped in single quotes within the SQL query. This should fix the bug and allow the function to execute without errors.
