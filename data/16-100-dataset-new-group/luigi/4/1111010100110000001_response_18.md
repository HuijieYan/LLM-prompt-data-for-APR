The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class inside the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The error is specifically occurring at line 338 when trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is of type 'NoneType'.

One potential error location is the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line. It seems that `self.columns` is being passed as `None`, which causes the `TypeError` when trying to check its length.

The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute of the `S3CopyToTable` class is being set to `None`, and the buggy `copy` function does not handle this case properly.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, and handle the case where `columns` is `None`. This can be done by using an `if` statement to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Add a check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
