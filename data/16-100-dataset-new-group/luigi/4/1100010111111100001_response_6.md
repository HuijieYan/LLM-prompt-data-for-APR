The buggy function is failing because the `columns` parameter is set to `None`, and the buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of `None`. This is the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Handle the case where self.columns is None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

This will ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if it is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError`. After making this change, the function should pass the failing test.
