## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `if len(self.columns) > 0` line could be causing the issue when `self.columns` is None.
2. The `creds=self._credentials()` line might not be returning the expected credentials.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing a TypeError when the `self.columns` attribute is None, resulting in the failure of Redshift COPY jobs. This is in line with the GitHub issue, where it is suggested that the bug is related to the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line. Additionally, the `_credentials` function may not be returning the correct credentials, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is None before trying to access its length.
2. Verify that the `_credentials` function is returning the expected credentials.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # Ensure that _credentials() returns correct credentials
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug. Additionally, we have also included a comment to remind us to verify the credentials returned by the `_credentials` function.
