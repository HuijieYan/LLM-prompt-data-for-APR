The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement, where it is trying to check the length of the `columns` attribute which is set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError` because it is not possible to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. We can use the `is not None` comparison to achieve this.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` that was causing the bug.
