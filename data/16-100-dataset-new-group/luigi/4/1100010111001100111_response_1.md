To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` to prevent the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. 

The cause of the bug is that the original code does not check for the `None` value of `self.columns` before attempting to use it in the `colnames` variable.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `if` condition to check for both the existence of `self.columns` and its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` should be assigned an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for existence and length of self.columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `copy` function checks for the existence and length of `self.columns` before using it to construct the `colnames` variable. It ensures that if `self.columns` is `None`, an empty string is assigned to `colnames`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

With this corrected version, the `copy` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
