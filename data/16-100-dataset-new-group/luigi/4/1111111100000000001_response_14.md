The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the `cursor.execute` call, where it references `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options`. The cause of the bug is that the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are being called as methods without the parentheses, which means they are not being executed as intended. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` are being called as methods, so we need to add parentheses after these function calls. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # Added parentheses
        options=self.copy_options())  # Added parentheses
    )
```

The bug fix involves adding parentheses after `self._credentials` and `self.copy_options` to ensure that they are called as methods.
