The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is not being used in the `COPY` SQL query and it's not providing a list of column names if they are specified. This means that even if the `columns` attribute is provided, it's not being included in the `COPY` statement.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is included in the `COPY` SQL query when it's not empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """




    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        if colnames:
            colnames = ' ' + colnames  # Add a space before colnames if it's not empty
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table}{colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

In the corrected version, I added a condition to check if `colnames` is not empty, and if it's not empty, I added a space before `colnames` in the `COPY` SQL query to ensure it's included when specified.
