The buggy function is the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. It is intended to define the copying from s3 into redshift, but it contains a bug that prevents it from working correctly. The bug appears to be in the `cursor.execute` statement, where the `options` variable is being incorrectly called as a function rather than accessing its value.

The cause of the bug is that the `options` variable `self.copy_options` is being incorrectly used as a function call, but it should be accessed directly to retrieve its value. This is because `self.copy_options` is a string attribute of the class that holds the options for the copy operation.

To fix the bug, we need to access the value of `self.copy_options` directly instead of calling it as a function. We can do this by removing the parentheses to treat it as a string. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options  # Removed the parentheses to access the value directly
    )
)
```
