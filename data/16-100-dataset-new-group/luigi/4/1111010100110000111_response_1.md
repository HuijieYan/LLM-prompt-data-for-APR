### Analysis
The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class seems to be causing an error due to the `self.columns` being `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when the length of `self.columns` is checked.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the `copy` function are the lines where `len(self.columns)` is checked without explicitly verifying that `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused because the `copy` function assumes that `self.columns` will always have a valid value, leading to an error when it is `None`. This is confirmed by the provided error message and the GitHub issue, which suggests that this behavior changed in `luigi` version 2.7.1, resulting in the code failing when `columns` are not provided.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when trying to check the length of a `None` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then proceed to check its length only if it is not `None`. This avoids the `TypeError` and resolves the issue reported in GitHub.
