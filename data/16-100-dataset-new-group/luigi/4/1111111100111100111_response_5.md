To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the `self.columns` attribute is not `None` before trying to retrieve its length. Based on the description in the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`. The fix should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the code will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` was `None`.
