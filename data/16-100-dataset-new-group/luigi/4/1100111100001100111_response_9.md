The bug in the provided `copy` function seems to be related to the use of `self.columns` where it is assumed to always exist. However, the GitHub issue suggests that there is a problem when `self.columns` is None and the code tries to perform operations on it, leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if `self.columns` exists before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the code now explicitly checks if `self.columns` exists before attempting to get its length, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
