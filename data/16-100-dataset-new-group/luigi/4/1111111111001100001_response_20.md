The buggy function has a few potential error locations that could be causing the failing test:

1. The `copy_options` method is not being called properly to get the options for the `COPY` statement. 
2. It's unclear why the `columns` attribute is being set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance.

In the provided test function, it's expected that the `COPY` statement will have an empty value for `colnames` and `options`, but the buggy function is not producing this expected result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` method is being called correctly and that the `columns` attribute is being handled properly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options method to get the options
    
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the options variable
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy_options` method is called correctly to populate the options in the `COPY` statement, and the `columns` attribute is being handled properly.

This correction should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
