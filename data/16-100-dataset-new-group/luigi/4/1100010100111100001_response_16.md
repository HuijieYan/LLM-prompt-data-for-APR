The bug in the `copy` function is causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`. This indicates that `self.columns` is of type `None`, which means the `columns` attribute of `self` has not been properly initialized.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `columns` attribute of `self` is properly initialized and is not `None` before trying to use it to construct the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )

```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we make sure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to retrieve its length. This should prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
