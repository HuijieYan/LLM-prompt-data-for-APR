The issue with the buggy function `copy` is that it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to access the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length, and assign an empty list to `colnames` in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this update, the `TypeError` due to `self.columns` being `None` will be avoided, and the corrected function should pass the failing test for `S3CopyToTable.copy` with `NoneType` columns.
