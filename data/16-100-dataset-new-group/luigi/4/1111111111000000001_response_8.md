The bug in the `copy` function is that it does not call the `copy_options` function to get the options for the `COPY` statement. Additionally, there is a problem with the formatting of the `COPY` statement string. The `colnames` and `options` need to be properly formatted but are not being utilized correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to get the options for the `COPY` statement, and properly format the `colnames` and `options` in the `execute` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to get the options

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=options)  # Use the options returned by copy_options
        )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should now properly utilize the `copy_options` function and format the `colnames` and `options`, which will allow it to pass the failing test.
