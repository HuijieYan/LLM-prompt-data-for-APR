The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error occurs when the `self.columns` parameter is None, causing a TypeError when trying to determine its length.

The cause of the bug is that the `self.columns` parameter is not being checked for None before trying to determine its length. This is in line with the information provided in the GitHub issue, suggesting that the bug occurs when `columns` is None. The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to add a check for `self.columns` being truthy before checking its length.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` method to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to find its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before finding its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if it is not None, thereby preventing the TypeError when `self.columns` is None. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
