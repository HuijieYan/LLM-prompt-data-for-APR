The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is not being used correctly. It is being calculated and assigned a value, but then not being used in the `cursor.execute` statement.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to make sure that the `colnames` variable is used in the `COPY` command within the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,  # Include colnames here
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable is now being used within the `cursor.execute` statement to include the column names when copying from S3 to Redshift. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the `colnames` are correctly used in the `COPY` command.
