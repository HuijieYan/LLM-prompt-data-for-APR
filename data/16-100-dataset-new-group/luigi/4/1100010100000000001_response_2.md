# corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Potential errors in the buggy function:
1. Missing closing parenthesis in the cursor.execute() call.
2. Unclear if the _credentials() method is properly handling both key-based and role-based credentials.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is the missing closing parenthesis in the cursor.execute() call, which will cause a syntax error.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Add the missing closing parenthesis in the cursor.execute() call. Additionally, ensure that the _credentials() method properly handles both key-based and role-based credentials.

Corrected version of the buggy function is provided above.
