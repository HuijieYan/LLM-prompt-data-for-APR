In the given buggy function, there are a few potential error locations. 

1. The `colnames` variable is being used without being properly initialized.
2. The `creds` variable is being initialized using a method `_credentials()`, but it is not clear from the given code what this method returns.
3. The `options` variable is being initialized using a method `self.copy_options`, but it is not being called as a method.


The cause of the bugs in this function is that the variables `colnames`, `creds`, and `options` are not being initialized correctly, and the methods `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are not being called properly.

To fix the bug, we need to properly initialize the `colnames`, `creds`, and `options` variables, and also call the methods `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    creds = self._credentials()  # call the _credentials method
    options = self.copy_options()  # call the copy_options method

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=creds,
        options=options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have properly initialized the `colnames`, `creds`, and `options` variables, and also called the methods `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` as intended.
