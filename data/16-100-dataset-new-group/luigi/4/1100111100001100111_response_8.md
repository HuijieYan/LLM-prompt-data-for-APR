Based on the GitHub issue and the provided runtime values, it seems that the bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is None, causing the `len(self.columns)` to throw a `TypeError`. The issue suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` as a possible solution.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `len(self.columns)` is only called when `self.columns` is not None, addressing the root cause of the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
