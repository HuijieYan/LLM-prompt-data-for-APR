The bug in the given code is that the `self.copy_options` is being treated as a function, but it is actually a method. This is causing an error in the `cursor.execute` statement.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method by adding parentheses at the end.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Now, when the `cursor.execute` statement is executed, the `self.copy_options` method will be correctly called as a function. This should fix the bug and allow the function to execute without errors.
