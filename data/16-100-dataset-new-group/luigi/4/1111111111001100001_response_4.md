The bug in the `copy` function is due to the `copy_options` being treated as a function and not being called. This causes the `options` variable in the `cursor.execute` string to have a string representation of the function instead of its actual value.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function and assign its result to the `options` variable in the `cursor.execute` string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # calling the copy_options function to get its value

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # using the options variable instead of self.copy_options
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will now call the `copy_options` function and use its result when constructing the SQL query, fixing the bug.
