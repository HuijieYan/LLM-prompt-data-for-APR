The bug in the `copy` function is that it does not handle the case where the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. This causes the code to try to call `len` on a `NoneType` object, resulting in the error `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to compute the length of the columns. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we can proceed with computing the length and formatting the `colnames` string.

The corrected version of the `copy` function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
