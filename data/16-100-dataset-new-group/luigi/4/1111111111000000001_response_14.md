The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the `S3CopyToTable` class has a potential error in the `cursor.execute` call where the `creds` and `options` are concatenated incorrectly. This is likely causing an issue that results in the failing test.

The function attempts to execute a SQL `COPY` statement, but the string concatenation for the `creds` and `options` parameters appears to be incorrect, which is causing the failing test.

To fix this bug, the string concatenation within the `cursor.execute` call should be adjusted to properly format the `creds` and `options` parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `self.copy_options` call is replaced with `self.copy_options()` to invoke the function and fetch the options string correctly. This should ensure that the `creds` and `options` parameters are concatenated properly in the `cursor.execute` call.

With this correction, it is expected that the failing test should now pass.
