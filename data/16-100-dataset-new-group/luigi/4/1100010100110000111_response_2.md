The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line, which throws a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, which identifies the same line as the root cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we should change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version will no longer throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, and it should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
