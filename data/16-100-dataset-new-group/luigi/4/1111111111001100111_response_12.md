The root cause of the bug in the `copy` function is that it doesn't handle the case where `self.columns` is None. This triggers a TypeError when trying to calculate the length of `self.columns` when it is None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to calculate its length. If it is None, then we should set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
