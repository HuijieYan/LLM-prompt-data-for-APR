The bug in the provided function is due to the comparison of the `self.columns` attribute with `None` using the `len()` function. The error message indicates that the `self.columns` attribute is of type `NoneType`, which means it is not initialized properly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `self.columns` attribute is initialized with a default value when it is not provided during the object instantiation. We can do this by using the `or` operator to provide a default value if `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `self.columns` attribute is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, the `len()` function will not be called, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring in the buggy version of the function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
