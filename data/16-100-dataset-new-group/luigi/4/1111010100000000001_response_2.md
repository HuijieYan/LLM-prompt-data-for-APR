The potential error in the buggy function is the mishandling of the `options` attribute and the string formatting used to construct the SQL query. 

The bug is caused by the improper formatting of the SQL query string, specifically the `options` attribute, and the missing handling for the `copy_options` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `options` and `copy_options` attributes and ensure that the SQL query string is constructed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = ''
    if self.copy_options:
        options = self.copy_options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )

```

In the corrected version, we have properly handled the `options` and `copy_options` attributes. If `copy_options` is provided, it will be included in the SQL query. This ensures that the SQL query string is constructed correctly and the bug is fixed.
