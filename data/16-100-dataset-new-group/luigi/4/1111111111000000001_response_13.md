The issue in the buggy function is that the `copy` function is not calling the `self.copy_options()` function to retrieve the copy options needed for the SQL statement.

The correct strategy for fixing the bug is to call the `self.copy_options()` function in the `copy` function to retrieve the copy options and include them in the SQL statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function now calls the `self.copy_options()` function to retrieve the copy options needed for the SQL statement. This will allow the function to behave as expected and pass the failing test.
