The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function is not checking if `self.columns` is None before trying to find its length. This results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to find its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This modification checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to find its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
