## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None and has length greater than 0
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, the buggy line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` has been replaced with `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This change ensures that the code does not try to access the length of a NoneType object, thereby resolving the TypeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.
