The bug in the `copy` function causes a TypeError to be raised because the function is trying to call the `len` function on the `columns` attribute without first checking if it is `None` or not. The error message specifically indicates that the `self.columns` attribute is of type 'NoneType' and therefore has no length.

To fix this bug, we need to perform a null check on the `self.columns` attribute before attempting to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that a `NoneType` object will not cause a TypeError. This will fix the bug and prevent the failing test.
