The bug in the `copy` function is that it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`. This issue was also reported in the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
