To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where self.columns is None before attempting to get its length. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Handle the case where self.columns is None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only attempt to get the length of self.columns if it is not None. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when self.columns is None.

This change reflects the suggestion in the GitHub issue, which recommended adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where self.columns is None. This modification ensures that the function can handle the scenario of no columns being provided without causing an error.
