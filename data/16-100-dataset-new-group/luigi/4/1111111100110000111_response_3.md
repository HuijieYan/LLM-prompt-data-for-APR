The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, possible cause of the TypeError as `self.columns` is None.
2. The line `creds=self._credentials(),` where the `_credentials` method is being called.

The cause of the bug is the TypeError occurs because the `self.columns` is None, and trying to get the length of None causes the error. This can be verified from the provided error message and the GitHub issue, where the root cause is mentioned and a suggested solution is to check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid explicitly asking for len(self.columns).

To fix the bug, we can update the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not None before getting the length of `self.columns`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This fix should address the bug and prevent the TypeError from occurring.
