The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a TypeError when trying to check the length of `self.columns` because it is None. This is likely because the `copy` function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None and avoid trying to calculate the length of it. We should also call the `copy_options` method by appending `()` to it, indicating that it is a function that needs to be called.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to make sure `self.columns` is not None before trying to calculate the length of it. Additionally, we appended `()` to `self.copy_options` to indicate that it should be called as a function.

This should fix the bug and the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is None, avoiding the TypeError.
