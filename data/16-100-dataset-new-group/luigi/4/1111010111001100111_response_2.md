To fix the bug, we need to address the issue of the `columns` attribute being `None` causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. We should modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to use it.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to use it in the `len` function. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.

This corrected version of the code should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to pass successfully.
