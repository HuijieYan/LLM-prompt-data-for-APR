The potential error location within the buggy function is the condition if len(self.columns) > 0, where it is not checking if self.columns is None before attempting to get its length.

The cause of the bug is that when the columns parameter is set to None, the buggy function does not handle this case and tries to get the length of a NoneType object, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the buggy function to handle the case when self.columns is None before attempting to get its length. We can add a check for None and update the condition accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the corrected function will handle the case when self.columns is None and prevent the TypeError from occurring.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub about the Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided.
