The error message indicates that the program is trying to access the length of a `NoneType`. This error occurs on line 356 of the file luigi/contrib/redshift.py, within the `copy` function, when the `len(self.columns)` is checked.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This fix ensures that if `self.columns` is `None`, it will not attempt to access its length and will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring.
