The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute. According to the GitHub issue, the bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` due to an attempt to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

The buggy function tries to construct the `colnames` variable using the `self.columns` attribute without first checking if it is `None`. This leads to the error when attempting to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a conditional check for `self.columns` to ensure that it is not `None` before attempting to construct the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is `None`, it sets `colnames` to an empty string, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring.
