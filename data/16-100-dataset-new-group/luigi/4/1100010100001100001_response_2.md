The bug in the function seems to be related to the generation of the `colnames` variable. 

The `colnames` variable is being generated from `self.columns`, and the buggy function attempts to join the column names using a comma. However, if `self.columns` is empty, the `colnames` variable remains an empty string.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is empty, and if so, skip the generation of the `colnames` variable and the corresponding formatting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added an `if self.columns` condition to check if `self.columns` is not empty. If it is not empty, we proceed with the generation of `colnames`, otherwise, we assign an empty string to `colnames`. This should fix the bug.
