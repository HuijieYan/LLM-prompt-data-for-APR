The bug in the provided code is that it does not handle the case when self.columns is None. This causes a TypeError because the code attempts to call len() on a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we should update the conditional statement to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This updated version of the function includes a check for self.columns before attempting to get its length, which will prevent the TypeError that was occurring.
