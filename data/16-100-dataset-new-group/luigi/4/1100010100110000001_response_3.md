### Correction:

The error message shows that `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` is raised when the buggy function `copy` is called. This indicates that the `self.columns` is of type `None` which causes the error when trying to get its length.

To fix this bug, ensure that the `self.columns` is checked to be not None before using it to get its length or accessing its elements.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the code first checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, ensuring that a `TypeError` will not be raised for `NoneType`. This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
