The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the way the `options` parameter is being passed to the `cursor.execute` method. The `copy_options` attribute should be a method call, but it is not being called in the buggy code.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` method is being assigned the `copy_options` attribute directly, instead of calling it as a function.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy_options` method should be called to retrieve the actual options for the `COPY` command, but in the buggy code, it is being assigned directly without calling it.

To fix the bug, the `copy_options` method should be called and the result should be assigned to the `options` variable. Then, the `options` variable should be used in the `cursor.execute` method.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options method to retrieve options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the options variable
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `copy_options` method is called to retrieve the options, and the result is assigned to the `options` variable. Then, the `options` variable is used in the `cursor.execute` method, fixing the bug.
