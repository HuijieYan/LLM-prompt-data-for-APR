The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. Missing indentation for the cursor.execute block within the copy function.
2. Unclear error handling mechanism if the execute statement fails.
3. Unnecessary use of string formatting to construct the SQL query.

The cause of the bug is the missing indentation for the cursor.execute block within the copy function, which will cause a syntax error when the function is executed.

To fix the bug, we need to properly indent the cursor.execute block within the copy function and handle any potential errors using try-except block. Additionally, we can use parameterized queries to construct the SQL query to ensure safe and clean code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    try:
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
         CREDENTIALS %s
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            options=self.copy_options
        ), (f, self._credentials()))
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error("Error occurred while copying data: %s", str(e))
        # handle the error gracefully, e.g. logging or raising a custom exception
```

In the corrected version, the cursor.execute block is properly indented, and a try-except block is added to handle any potential errors. The SQL query is also constructed using parameterized queries to ensure safe and clean code.
