Based on the given information, the bug is happening in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the `self.columns` is of type `NoneType` and has no length. This aligns with the description in the GitHub issue, which also points out the same root cause.

The buggy function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly, leading to the `TypeError`. To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
