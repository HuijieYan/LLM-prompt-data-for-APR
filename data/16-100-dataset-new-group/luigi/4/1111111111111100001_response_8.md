The bug in the `copy` function is causing a TypeError due to the usage of a None value for `self.columns`. This results in an error when the function tries to check the length of `self.columns`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. We can modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get the length of it.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()
    )
)
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, we prevent the TypeError from occurring. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
