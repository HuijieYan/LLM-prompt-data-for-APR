## Analysis
The buggy function is `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. The function is failing when it tries to check the length of `self.columns`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the `copy` function with `columns` set to `None`, and it expects the function to run without error.

The error message indicates that the length of `NoneType` object is being checked, leading to a `TypeError`.

The GitHub issue suggests that the bug is related to a recent change in the codebase, and it proposes a potential fix.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first confirming that `self.columns` is not `None`. This is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by first checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it should not be checked for length.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This should prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
