ERROR IDENTIFICATION:
There are several potential error locations within the buggy function `copy`:
1. The use of `logger` without importing it.
2. The use of `self.columns` without checking if it is provided.

CAUSE OF THE BUG:
The primary cause of the bug is the potential missing import for the `logger` and the assumption that `self.columns` is always provided without checking.

STRATEGY FOR FIXING THE BUG:
1. Import the required `logger` class.
2. Check if `self.columns` is provided before using it.

CORRECTED VERSION:
```python
import logging

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Fixed: Added logger import and initialization
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if getattr(self, 'columns', None) and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed: Checked if self.columns is provided before using it
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```
The corrected version of the function includes importing the `logging` module and initializing the `logger` object. Additionally, it checks if `self.columns` is available before attempting to access it.
