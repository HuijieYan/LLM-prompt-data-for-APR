## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version:
- I added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before trying to get the length of `self.columns` to avoid the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
- This change aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue, which provides a possible solution for addressing the bug.
