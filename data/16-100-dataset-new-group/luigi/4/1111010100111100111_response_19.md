Based on the provided information, the bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, where it tries to check the length of `self.columns`, but fails when `self.columns` is None. This is consistent with the failing test message, which indicates a `TypeError` due to an object of type 'NoneType' having no length.

To fix this bug, the `columns` attribute should be checked for existence before attempting to determine its length. This can be achieved by using `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
