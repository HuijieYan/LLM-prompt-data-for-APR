The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing a `TypeError` when the `len` function is called on the `columns` attribute of the task. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None` and then runs the task, which calls the `copy` function. Inside the `copy` function, the length of `self.columns` is checked, which results in a `TypeError` since `self.columns` is `None` and `NoneType` does not have a length.

To fix this bug, a check for `None` should be added before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, then further processing should be skipped, assuming that an empty string for `colnames` is acceptable in this case.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `copy` function checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to process it, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring.
