The bug in the provided function is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, where it tries to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is None.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `self.columns is not None` before attempting to check its length. This will prevent the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error that was being raised in the failing test.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
