The buggy function is the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. It is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift. The issue occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a TypeError during the execution of the `COPY` statement in Redshift.

The test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` confirms the bug by mocking the `RedshiftTarget` object and verifying that the `COPY` statement is not being executed correctly.

The GitHub issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides insights into the root cause of the bug, referencing a specific line of code that needs to be modified to address the issue.

The potential error locations within the `copy` function are the conditions for checking the length of `self.columns` and how it is used in the `COPY` statement. The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code is attempting to get the length of `None`, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` should be modified to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a check is added to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This prevents the TypeError from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
