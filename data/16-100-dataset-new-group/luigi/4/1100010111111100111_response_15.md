## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The bug is caused by directly accessing the length of the "self.columns" without checking if it exists or not. The corrected version adds a check to ensure "self.columns" is not None before attempting to get its length.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub issue, where it was suggested to change the line to "if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0" to prevent the AttributeError when self.columns is None.

This correction will ensure that the code won't try to access the length of "self.columns" if it is None, avoiding the TypeError and allowing the function to handle the case where columns are not provided.
