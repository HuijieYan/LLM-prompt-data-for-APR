Buggy function explanation:
The buggy function `copy()` is trying to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. It constructs a SQL `COPY` command and then executes it on the Redshift database using the `cursor` object. There are potential issues with the `colnames` variable, `self.columns`, and the `copy_options` attribute within the `cursor.execute` SQL query.

Potential error locations:
1. The `colnames` variable may not be constructed correctly.
2. The `self.columns` attribute may not be populated with the correct column names.
3. The `self._credentials()` method might not return the correct credentials.
4. The `self.copy_options` attribute may not be defined or initialized incorrectly.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `self.columns` attribute is properly initialized and contains the correct column names.
2. Ensure that the `colnames` variable is constructed correctly by joining the column names with commas.
3. Verify that the `self._credentials()` method returns the correct credentials for the database connection.
4. Make sure that the `self.copy_options` attribute is properly defined and initialized with the necessary copy options.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=("" if not hasattr(self, 'copy_options') else self.copy_options))
    )
```
In the corrected version, we also added a check for the existence of `self.copy_options` to prevent AttributeError in case the attribute is not defined.
