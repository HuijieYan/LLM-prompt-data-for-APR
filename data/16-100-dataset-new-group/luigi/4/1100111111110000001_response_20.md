The issue in the buggy function is that it is not handling the `columns` attribute properly. In the `copy` function, the code is checking if the length of `self.columns` is greater than 0, which leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This is causing the test to fail with the error message "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()".

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
