The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the `columns` parameter is None. This causes the `colnames` variable to remain empty, resulting in an extra comma in the `COPY` statement.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `columns` parameter is None and handle it appropriately to ensure that the `colnames` variable is generated correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where the `columns` parameter is None, and the `colnames` variable will be generated correctly for the `COPY` statement. This will ensure that the failing test will pass.
