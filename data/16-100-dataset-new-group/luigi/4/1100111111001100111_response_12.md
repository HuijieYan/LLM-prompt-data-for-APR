## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Explanation:
The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not check if the columns are None before trying to get the length of the columns, which leads to a TypeError when columns are None.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function checks if self.columns is not None before attempting to get the length, preventing the TypeError.

The corrected version of the function adds the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that the length of the columns is only calculated if self.columns is not None.

With this fix, the function will only try to get the length of the columns if they are not None, preventing the TypeError and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
