The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the use of `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` method. The `self.copy_options` should be a method call instead of a property access. Additionally, the `colnames` variable may be incorrectly formatted if the `self.columns` attribute is None or empty.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the `copy_options` method to return options as a string instead of being called directly in the `cursor.execute` method.
2. Check if the `self.columns` attribute exists and is not None before formatting the `colnames` variable.
3. Replace `self.copy_options` with `self.copy_options()` in the `cursor.execute` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With these changes, the `copy` function should now handle the `colnames` and `copy_options` properly, and the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass.
