The potential error in the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the `columns` attribute being `None` properly.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the function doesn't handle it gracefully and tries to iterate over it to join the column names, which results in an error.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is `None` and handle it properly before trying to join the column names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length or iterate over it, which should resolve the bug.
