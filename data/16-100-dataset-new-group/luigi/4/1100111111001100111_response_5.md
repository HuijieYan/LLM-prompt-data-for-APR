The bug in the `copy` function is caused by a failure to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This causes the `colnames` variable to be an empty string, resulting in the `COPY` statement being incorrectly formatted when executed.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not None before constructing the `colnames` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This change ensures that the `colnames` variable is constructed only when `self.columns` is not None, which resolves the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
