The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when the function is called with `columns=None`, as shown in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the `copy` function should include a check for `None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`. Additionally, it should provide a default value for `colnames` when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check for None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:  # Only check length if not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check for `self.columns` being `None`, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
