The bug in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a TypeError when the `columns` attribute is None. The `copy` method is attempting to determine the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is None.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to determine its length.

Additionally, since the test is calling the `run` method of the task and not directly calling the `copy` method, it would be a good idea to add a specific test for the `copy` method.

Below is the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Now, when the `columns` attribute is None, the code block inside the `if` statement will be skipped, preventing the TypeError.

Additionally, here is a new test specifically for the `copy` method:
```python
def test_copy_with_none_columns(self, mock_redshift_target):
    task = DummyS3CopyToTableKey(columns=None)

    mock_cursor = (mock_redshift_target.return_value
                                       .connect
                                       .return_value
                                       .cursor
                                       .return_value)

    task.copy(mock_cursor, 's3://bucket/key')

    mock_cursor.execute.assert_called_with("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table='dummy_table',
        colnames='',
        source='s3://bucket/key',
        creds='aws_access_key_id=key;aws_secret_access_key=secret',
        options='')
    )
```

Now, the corrected `copy` method should pass the updated test.
