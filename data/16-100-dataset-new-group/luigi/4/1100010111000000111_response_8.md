The buggy function `copy` has a potential error location at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it tries to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when `self.columns` is None.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is None, the function tries to check the length of None, which results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we should modify the code to handle the case when `self.columns` is None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to check its length, preventing the TypeError. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
