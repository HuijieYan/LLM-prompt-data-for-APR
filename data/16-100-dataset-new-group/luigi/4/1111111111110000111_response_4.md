The cause of the bug in the `copy` function is that it's not properly handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `None`. This bug was reported in a GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The proposed solution in the GitHub issue suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should be modified to appropriately handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` statement checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, thus avoiding the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This modification ensures that the function can handle the case when `self.columns` is not provided and prevents the bug identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
