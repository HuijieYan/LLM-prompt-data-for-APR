The bug in the given code is that the `copy_options` function is not being called. Instead, the code is attempting to pass the function itself as a string in the `COPY` query. This is likely not the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` function should be called to retrieve the options string and then passed to the `COPY` query. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        # Call the copy_options function to get the options string
        options = self.copy_options()

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=options)
        )
```

With this corrected code, the `copy_options` function is now called to retrieve the options string, which is then properly passed to the `COPY` query. This should fix the bug and ensure that the correct options are used in the `COPY` operation.
