First, let's analyze the buggy function and the failing test:

The buggy function is the `copy` method in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. It is failing because when `self.columns` is set to `None`, it tries to call `len(self.columns)` which results in a `TypeError` since `NoneType` has no length.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None` and then check if the `copy` method is called with the correct parameters.

Based on the runtime values provided, it's clear that the issue is due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` trying to access the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` and causing a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we should change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` so that it only tries to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix the condition
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` method will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, resolving the `TypeError` issue.

This change should also resolve the GitHub issue by addressing the root cause and providing a solution to the problem.
