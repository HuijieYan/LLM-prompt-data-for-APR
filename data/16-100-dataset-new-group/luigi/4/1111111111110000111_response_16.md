The bug in the provided function is due to the comparison of the `columns` attribute with the condition `len(self.columns) > 0`, which causes a TypeError when `columns` is None. The bug results in failing Redshift COPY jobs when columns are not provided, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle cases where `columns` is None, preventing the TypeError reported in the failing test and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
