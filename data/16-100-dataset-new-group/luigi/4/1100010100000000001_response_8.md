The potential error in the buggy function is in the way the SQL query string is formatted. This can cause the function to fail when executed due to issues with the formatting of the query.

The cause of the bug is that the SQL query string is not formatted correctly, which can lead to syntax errors when trying to execute the query.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to use parameterized queries instead of directly formatting the SQL query string. This will help to prevent syntax errors and also protect against SQL injection attacks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
import logging

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
    COPY {table} {colnames} from %(source)s
    CREDENTIALS %(creds)s
    %(options)s
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )
    
    cursor.execute(query, {'source': f, 'creds': self._credentials(), 'options': self.copy_options})
```
In the corrected version, a parameterized query is used with the cursor.execute() method to execute the query. This will ensure that the query is properly formatted and prevent any syntax errors.
