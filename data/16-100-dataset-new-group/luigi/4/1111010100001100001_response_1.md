The buggy function `copy` is failing to properly execute the `COPY` command to copy data from s3 into Redshift. The potential error locations within the function include:
1. Incorrect string formatting in the `cursor.execute` statement.
2. Potential issues with the `_credentials()` method.
3. Incorrect usage of `colnames` variable.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect string formatting in the `cursor.execute` statement, which may result in the `COPY` command not being executed correctly. Additionally, if the `_credentials()` method is not providing the expected credentials, it may cause the `COPY` command to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `COPY` command is properly formatted and that the `_credentials()` method is providing the correct credentials.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    credentials = self._credentials()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
