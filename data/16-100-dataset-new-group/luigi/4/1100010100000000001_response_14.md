The buggy function is the copy method within the luigi/contrib/redshift.py file. The function is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift. The potential error locations within the function could be in the string formatting of the SQL query and the use of self.columns.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect formatting of the SQL query within the execute method of the cursor. It seems that the colnames and creds variables are not being properly formatted into the query string, leading to a syntax error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the colnames and creds variables are formatted correctly within the SQL query string. This can be done by removing unnecessary indentation of the query and ensuring that the variables are properly passed into the string using the correct formatting.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_query = """
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    """.format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(copy_query + ";")
```

In the corrected version, we removed unnecessary indentation from the SQL query, defined the query as a separate variable, and then used the cursor.execute method to execute the query with proper formatting.
