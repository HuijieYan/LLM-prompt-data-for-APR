To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to address the issues in the `copy` function where the `cursor.execute` method is used. 

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect use of the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` methods, as well as the improper formatting of the SQL query within the `cursor.execute` call.

The `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` methods need to be called to retrieve their respective values, and the SQL query within the `cursor.execute` call needs to be properly formatted.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` are properly called as methods to retrieve their values, and the SQL query within the `cursor.execute` call is properly formatted.
