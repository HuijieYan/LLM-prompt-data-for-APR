The cause of the bug is that when self.columns is set to None, the buggy function does not handle this case and tries to call len(None), which results in a TypeError. This issue was reported on GitHub and the suggested solution is to modify the condition to check if self.columns exists and has a non-zero length before trying to access its length.

To fix the bug, we should update the buggy function to handle the case when self.columns is None by checking if it exists and has a non-zero length before trying to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function will check if self.columns exists and has a non-zero length before trying to access its length, which will resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
