```

### Analysis
The buggy function attempts to execute a COPY command to copy data from S3 into Redshift using cursor.execute(). It uses self._credentials() and self.copy_options() to provide credentials and options for the COPY command.

### Identified Error
The buggy function has two potential errors:
1. It calls self._credentials without the required parentheses, leading to a potential reference error.
2. It calls self.copy_options without the required parentheses, leading to a potential reference error.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of self._credentials and self.copy_options, where the functions are not being called correctly due to missing parentheses. This may lead to incorrect credentials and options being used for the COPY command.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to call the _credentials and copy_options functions correctly by adding parentheses after their names so that they are invoked as functions and return the required credentials and options for the COPY command.

### Corrected Version
The corrected version of the buggy function has been updated to call self._credentials() and self.copy_options() with the required parentheses, ensuring that the functions are invoked and their return values are used for the COPY command.
