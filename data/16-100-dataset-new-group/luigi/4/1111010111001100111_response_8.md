## Fixing the bug

The bug seems to be caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition in the `copy` function. This condition fails when `self.columns` is `None`, triggering a `TypeError`. To fix this, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
