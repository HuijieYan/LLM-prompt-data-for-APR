The potential error in the copy function is that it does not handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the SQL query. This could result in the function failing silently, making it difficult to debug errors.

To fix this issue, we need to add error handling to the copy function and provide meaningful error messages or raise exceptions as appropriate.

Here's the corrected version of the copy function with added error handling:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    try:
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the exception, e.g. log the error message or raise a new exception
        logger.error("Error occurred while copying data: {}".format(str(e)))
        raise
```

In the corrected version, we added a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the SQL query. Inside the except block, we handle the exception by logging the error message and raising a new exception to signal that an error occurred. This will make it easier to identify and debug any issues that may arise during the execution of the copy function.
