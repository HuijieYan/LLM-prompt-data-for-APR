Based on the provided information and the runtime values of the variables, it seems that the bug in the `copy` function lies in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are not being called and used correctly within the `cursor.execute` statement. 

The bug in the `cursor.execute` statement is caused by not calling the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` functions to retrieve their return values. 

To fix the bug, we need to call the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` functions to get their return values and use those values in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    credentials = self._credentials()
    options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,
        options=options
        )
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` functions are called and their return values are stored in the `credentials` and `options` variables, which are then used in the `cursor.execute` statement.
