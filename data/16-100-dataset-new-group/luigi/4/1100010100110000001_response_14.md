The buggy function is a method `copy` within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` that occurs in the `copy` method on line 338. Specifically, the error occurs at the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is of type `None`.

The bug is caused by trying to get the length of the variable `self.columns` when it is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` since it is not possible to get the length of `None`.

To fix the bug, a strategy should involve checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` as an empty string. If it is not `None`, then we can proceed to extract the column names and format them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we set `colnames` as an empty string. Otherwise, we extract the column names and format them accordingly. This assures that we avoid trying to get the length of `None` and prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.
