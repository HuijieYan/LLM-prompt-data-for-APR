## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function

            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

### Explanation
The issue stems from the fact that the `self.columns` can be `None`, and attempting to get the length of `None` results in a `TypeError`. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This is implemented by using `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` has a value before attempting to get its length.

By making this change, the bug should be fixed and the function should no longer produce a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
