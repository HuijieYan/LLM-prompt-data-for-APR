The issue with the original buggy function is that it does not handle the case when the "columns" attribute is set to None. It tries to check the length of the "columns" attribute without verifying whether it is not None, which results in a TypeError when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the if statement to first check if the "columns" attribute is not None before trying to check its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function checks if the "columns" attribute is not None before trying to get its length, resolving the issue where a TypeError was being raised when "columns" was set to None.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test as well.
