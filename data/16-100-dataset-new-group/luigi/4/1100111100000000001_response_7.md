The bug in the given function seems to be with the `copy_options` method and the formatting of the SQL query. 

The `copy_options` method should be called as a function rather than being referenced directly in the formatting of the SQL query. Additionally, there is a missing parenthesis for the `self.copy_options` method call.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should be updated as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `copy_options` method is called as a function with the `()` at the end, allowing it to properly return the copy options for the SQL query.
