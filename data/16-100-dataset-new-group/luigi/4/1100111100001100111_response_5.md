The bug in the provided code is that the `self.columns` is `None`, and the code doesn't check for this condition before trying to access the length of `self.columns`. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def _credentials(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def copy_options(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` check, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only accessed when `self.columns` is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` issue described in the GitHub bug report.
