The function is failing because it is trying to retrieve the length of a 'NoneType' object, which is not allowed. This happens because the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, and the function is not handling this case properly.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to retrieve its length, and set `colnames` to an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the TypeError.
