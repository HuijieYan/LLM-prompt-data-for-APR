The bug in the given function is that the `self.copy_options` variable is not being called as a function within the `cursor.execute` statement. Instead, it is being passed as a string without being executed.

To fix this bug, the `self.copy_options` variable should be called as a function in the `cursor.execute` statement to ensure that its value is correctly passed to the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(
        """
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options()
        )
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `self.copy_options` variable is called as a function with `self.copy_options()` within the `cursor.execute` statement. This ensures that the function is executed and its return value is correctly used in the SQL query.
