Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `copy` function is related to the use of the `copy_options` attribute and the `colnames` variable. The `copy_options` should be a function call, not an attribute, and the `colnames` variable is not being generated correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy_options` should be called as a function, but it is being referenced as an attribute. Additionally, the `colnames` variable is not being correctly generated due to the incorrect use of the `self.columns`.

To fix the bug, the `copy_options` attribute should be called as a function, and the `colnames` variable should be generated correctly based on the `self.columns` attribute. 

Here is a corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join(self.columns)
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `copy_options` attribute is called as a function by adding `()` at the end, and the `colnames` variable is generated correctly based on the `self.columns` attribute. This should resolve the bug in the `copy` function.
