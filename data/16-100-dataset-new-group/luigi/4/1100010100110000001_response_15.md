The bug in the provided function is in the `copy` method. It attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without first performing a null check, and this causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. Additionally, if `self.columns` is `None`, the function should handle it gracefully or raise an exception, as per the requirements of the application.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        raise ValueError("No columns were provided.")

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and if it is `None`, we raise a `ValueError` to indicate that columns were not provided. This ensures that the function does not attempt to get the length of a `NoneType` object, fixing the `TypeError` that was occurring.
