The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file has a bug that causes it to fail the test. The problem arises from the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition where `self.columns` is expected to be a list but is instead None, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, the condition should be updated to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed the condition to check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should now correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is None and pass the failing test.
