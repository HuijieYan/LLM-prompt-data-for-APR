## Bug Fix

### Explanation
The bug is caused by the buggy function trying to call `len` on the `self.columns`, which is set to `None`, resulting in the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, which suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The fix involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to call `len` on it. This will ensure that the code does not error out when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before calling len
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the code will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, thus resolving the `TypeError` issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
