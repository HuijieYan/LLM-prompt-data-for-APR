### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function occurs when trying to format the SQL string for the `COPY` command. The `colnames` variable is being correctly derived from the `self.columns` attribute, but it is not being used in the SQL string. Additionally, the `self.copy_options` attribute is being passed as a function reference rather than being called as a function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is properly included in the SQL string and that `self.copy_options` is being called as a function rather than passed as a reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,  # Include colnames in the SQL string
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # Call _credentials() function
        options=self.copy_options()  # Call copy_options() function
    )
)
```
