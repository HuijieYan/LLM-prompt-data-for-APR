The bug in the copy function of the S3CopyToTable class is related to the columns attribute being set to None. When columns is None, the code in the buggy function attempts to call len() on it, which results in a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). This behavior was identified from the failing test, which was triggered by the fix posted in the GitHub issue.

The suggested fix in the GitHub issue is to modify the code to check if self.columns is not None before attempting to find its length. This will prevent the TypeError and allow the function to execute properly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the function no longer attempts to call len() on None, and the bug will be fixed. This corrected version of the function will pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
