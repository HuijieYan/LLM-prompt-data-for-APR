## The bug
The bug in the `copy` function is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `cursor.execute` method. The string formatting inside `cursor.execute` may not be correct, resulting in a syntax error when attempting to execute the SQL `COPY` command.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the string formatting inside the `cursor.execute` method is correct and that the SQL `COPY` command is properly constructed.

## Corrected version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        copy_query = """
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        
        cursor.execute(copy_query)
```
