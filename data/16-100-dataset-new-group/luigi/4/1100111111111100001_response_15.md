The bug in the `copy` function is occurring because the `columns` attribute of the `self` object is being passed as `None` instead of an empty list. This causes the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition to raise a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `columns` attribute is always set to an empty list if no columns are provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, and we also call `self.copy_options()` instead of just using `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement.

With these changes, the `copy` function should now handle the case where no columns are provided without raising a `TypeError`, and pass the failing test.
