The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the `self.columns` parameter is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when the buggy function tries to check the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, we can simply check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string, otherwise, we can proceed as before.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
