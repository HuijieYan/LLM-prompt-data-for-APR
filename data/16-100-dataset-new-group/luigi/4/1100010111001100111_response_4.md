To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. Currently, the buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list and attempts to access its elements without checking if it is `None`. 

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # handle the case where self.columns is None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its elements, preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
