The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a TypeError when the `columns` attribute is set to None. The error occurs when attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without first confirming that it is not None.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function assumes that `self.columns` will always be a non-empty list, and attempts to check its length without verifying that it is not None. This assumption leads to an error when `self.columns` is set to None.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access and check its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version adds a check `if self.columns` before attempting to access its length, ensuring that the code does not try to treat a None value as an iterable. This aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue and should resolve the TypeError when `columns` are set to None.
