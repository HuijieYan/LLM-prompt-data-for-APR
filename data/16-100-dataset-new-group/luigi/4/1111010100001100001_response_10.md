The bug seems to be related to the use of parameters within the `cursor.execute` call. The `colnames` variable is being used as a placeholder for the column names, but it is not being used correctly in the SQL query string.

The `colnames` should only be appended to the SQL query if there are columns provided. Additionally, the `COPY FROM` command should be followed by the S3 path and not the local file path.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not empty and then construct the `colnames` string. The `source` variable should be assigned the S3 path, and the `colnames` should be used in the query if it is not empty.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:  # check if columns are provided
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        query = """
        COPY {table} {colnames}
        FROM '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=self.s3_load_path,  # use the s3 path
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options
        )
    else:  # if no columns provided
        query = """
        COPY {table}
        FROM '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            source=self.s3_load_path,  # use the s3 path
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options
        )

    cursor.execute(query)
```

In this corrected version, we check if columns are provided, construct the `colnames` string, and then use it in the query if it's not empty. We also correctly assign the S3 path to the `source` variable within the SQL query string.
