Based on the GitHub issue and the runtime input/output values, the cause of the bug is that when columns are not provided (i.e., None), the buggy function still tries to access the length of the columns, resulting in a TypeError. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue is to check if self.columns exists before checking its length.

To fix the bug, we can modify the buggy function to include the suggested if statement to check if self.columns exists before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will first check if self.columns exists before attempting to access its length, thereby preventing the TypeError when columns are not provided.
