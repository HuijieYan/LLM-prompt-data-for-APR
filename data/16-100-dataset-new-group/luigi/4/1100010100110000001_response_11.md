The buggy function is `copy` which is a method in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `copy` method when trying to access the length of an object of type 'NoneType'.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only attempt to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring in the original buggy function.
