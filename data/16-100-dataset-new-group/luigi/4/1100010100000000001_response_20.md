The potential error in the buggy function is the formatting of the SQL query string. The parameters are passed in the string using the .format() method, but the formatting may not be done correctly, leading to syntax errors in the SQL query.

To fix this bug, the string formatting should be done using parameterized queries to ensure proper formatting of the SQL query and prevent SQL injection attacks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
     CREDENTIALS %s
     %s
     ;""", (self.table, colnames, f, self._credentials(), self.copy_options))
```

In the corrected version, the SQL query uses parameterized queries by passing the parameters separately from the SQL string. This ensures that the SQL query is properly formatted and prevents any syntax errors.
