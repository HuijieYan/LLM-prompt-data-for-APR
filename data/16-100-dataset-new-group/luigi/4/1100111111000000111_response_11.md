The buggy function `copy()` is failing when the `self.columns` attribute is set to None, leading to a TypeError. The issue is identified in the related GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The proposed solution is to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix the bug, we need to implement the suggested solution and handle the case when `self.columns` is None. Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not None before using it, we ensure that the TypeError will not occur when the columns are not provided. This fix addresses the bug and allows the `copy()` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.
