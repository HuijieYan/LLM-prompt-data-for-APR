## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Explanation:
1. The bug was caused by directly trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not None. This caused a `TypeError` when `self.columns` was set to `None`.
2. By adding a check to see if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length using `len()`, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
3. The GitHub issue also suggests the same solution, verifying that it is the appropriate fix for the bug.
4. By modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that we first check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to get its length.
5. Corrected the `options` value by calling the `copy_options` function with `()`. Without the `()` the `copy_options` was not being called as a function but rather being treated as an attribute.

The corrected version aims to address the issue described in the GitHub report and the failure in the test case.
