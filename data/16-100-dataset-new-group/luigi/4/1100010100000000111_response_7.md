## Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `redshift.py` file in the `luigi/contrib` directory.
- The function is used for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute.
- The GitHub issue specifies that when `columns` are set to None, the Redshift COPY job fails in version 2.7.1 of Luigi due to a TypeError.

## Identified Bug:
- The bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is `None` and the function tries to access its length with `len(self.columns) > 0`, resulting in a TypeError.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The cause of the bug is the use of `len(self.columns) > 0` instead of checking if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The bug can be fixed by adding a check for `None` before attempting to access the length of `self.columns`.
- The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug-fixed Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for None before accessing the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The bug-fixed version of the function includes a check for `None` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
