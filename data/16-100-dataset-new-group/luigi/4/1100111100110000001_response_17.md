From the error message, it is clear that the main issue is with the `self.columns` attribute, which is of type `NoneType` and is causing a `TypeError` when trying to get its length.

The bug is likely caused by the `colnames` being derived from `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is not `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to use it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added the conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length and construct `colnames`. This should fix the `TypeError` caused by the buggy function.
