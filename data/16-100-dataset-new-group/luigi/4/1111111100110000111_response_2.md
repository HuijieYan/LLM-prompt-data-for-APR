## Analysis

The buggy function is copy, which is part of the S3CopyToTable class in the luigi.contrib.redshift module. This function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The error message indicates a TypeError due to trying to get the length of a NoneType object, specifically when checking the length of self.columns. 

Looking at the related GitHub issue, it seems that the bug was introduced in luigi 2.7.1 due to a specific change in the code, and the suggested solution is to modify the condition to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

## Identify Potential Error Locations

The potential error location in the buggy function is the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

## Cause of the Bug

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not check if self.columns is None before trying to get its length. Therefore, if self.columns is None, trying to get its length will raise a TypeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

The bug can be fixed by modifying the condition to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

## The Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` is used to first check if self.columns is not None before attempting to get its length. This change should resolve the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.
