The buggy function is within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for copying data from s3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute when it is set to `None`.

The bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided, causing the `colnames` variable to remain an empty string. When the `COPY` command is executed, it tries to use the `colnames` variable even when it is empty, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. If it is indeed not None, then we can proceed with generating the `colnames` string.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. This will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is not provided.
