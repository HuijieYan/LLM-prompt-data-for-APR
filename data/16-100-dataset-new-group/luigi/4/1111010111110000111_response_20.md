The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will handle the case where `self.columns` is None and avoid the `TypeError` that was raised in the failing test.
