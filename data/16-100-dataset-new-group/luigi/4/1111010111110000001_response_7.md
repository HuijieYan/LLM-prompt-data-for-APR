The bug in the given code is that the `copy` function doesn't handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly. This causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to check the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we should handle it differently than if it has a value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This fixed version should pass the failing test without raising the `TypeError` due to a `NoneType` object.
