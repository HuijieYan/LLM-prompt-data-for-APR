The bug in the provided function is caused by the comparison of the 'columns' attribute with None, resulting in a TypeError when trying to calculate its length using the len() function.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the 'columns' attribute is not None before performing any operations on it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, we are checking if the 'columns' attribute is not None before proceeding with the operations, preventing the TypeError from occurring.

This should address the issue and the function should now pass the failing test.
