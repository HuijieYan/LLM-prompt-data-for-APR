The cause of the bug is due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line in the `copy` function, which is trying to access the length of `self.columns` without properly checking if it exists or is None. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line should be updated to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to properly check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns exists and has length greater than 0
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
