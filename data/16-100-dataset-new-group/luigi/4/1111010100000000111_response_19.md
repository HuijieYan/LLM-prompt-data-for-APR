The issue in the provided buggy function is related to the `self.columns` attribute, which is causing a `TypeError` when its length is checked. The bug occurs when trying to run Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None`, which is supposed to prohibit table creation. The bug is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` when `self.columns` is `None` resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` needs to be modified to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to first check if `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By making this change to the condition, the bug causing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` will be resolved.
