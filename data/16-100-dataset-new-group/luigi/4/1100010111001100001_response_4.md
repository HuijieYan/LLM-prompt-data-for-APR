The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case when the columns parameter is None. This causes the colnames variable to remain an empty string, which results in a missing column list in the SQL COPY statement.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the columns parameter is None and handle it appropriately to avoid an empty colnames variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now check if the columns parameter is None and only construct the colnames variable if it is not None. This will ensure that the SQL COPY statement includes the column list when necessary.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
