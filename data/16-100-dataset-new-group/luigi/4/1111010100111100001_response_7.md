The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line, which raises a TypeError because `self.columns` is `None`. This is indicated by the error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before using it to avoid the TypeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before using it
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the buggy line will not be executed when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the TypeError.

With this correction, the `copy` function should work correctly for cases where `self.columns` is `None`.
