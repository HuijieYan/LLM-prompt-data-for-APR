The bug in the `copy` function is causing a `TypeError` because the `self.columns` is set to `None` and the function is trying to check its length using `len(self.columns)`. Since `self.columns` is `None`, it cannot be checked for length, resulting in the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it's `None`, we can handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it's not `None`, we proceed with getting the column names and executing the `cursor.execute` as before.

This should fix the `TypeError` bug and make the function work as expected.
