The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` when `self.columns` is None, leading to a TypeError. The GitHub issue also confirms that this is the root cause of the problem, and it suggests a solution to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`

To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` function to include the suggested check for `self.columns` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By including the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that the `len` function is only called when `self.columns` is not None, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
