The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to an object of type `NoneType` not having a length.

The potential error location within the `copy` method is the line that checks the length of `self.columns`. It appears that `self.columns` is expected to be a list, but it is actually `None`.

The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is `None` instead of a list, which leads to the `TypeError` when trying to check its length.

To fix the bug, it would be best to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, then we can handle this case appropriately, such as by setting `colnames` to an empty string. 

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that if `self.columns` is `None`, it won't throw a `TypeError` when checking its length. Instead, it will skip the block and set `colnames` to an empty string.
