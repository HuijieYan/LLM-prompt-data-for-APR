The bug in the given function is that the `copy_options` function is not being called to retrieve the options for the Redshift COPY command. 

The `copy_options` function is defined in the same class and should be called to retrieve the options for the copy command. However, in the buggy `copy` function, it is not being called correctly. The syntax `self.copy_options` suggests that it is intended to be a function call, but it is missing the parenthesis.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the function call to `copy_options()` and ensure that it is properly called to retrieve the options for the COPY command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will now be correctly called to retrieve the options for the Redshift COPY command.
