The potential error in the `copy` function is that it's not handling the case where `colnames` is an empty string. This causes an extra comma to appear in the SQL query when no columns are specified, which leads to a syntax error when executing the query.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `colnames` is not empty before including it in the SQL query.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    colnames_clause = colnames if colnames else ''  # Check if colnames is not empty

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames_clause,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the corrected function will handle the case where `colnames` is empty and avoid the extra comma in the SQL query.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
