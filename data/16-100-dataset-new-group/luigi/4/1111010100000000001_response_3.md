Potential Errors:
- The function is missing the appropriate logging setup.
- The function is not handling potential errors related to the `cursor.execute` method.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely causing issues with the `COPY` command execution in Redshift. There is also potential for errors in handling the column names and credentials.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Set up logging within the function to provide visibility into the file being inserted.
2. Add error handling to the `cursor.execute` method to properly catch and log any potential errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import logging

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    # this is the fixed function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        try:
            cursor.execute("""
             COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
             CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
             {options}
             ;""".format(
                table=self.table,
                colnames=colnames,
                source=f,
                creds=self._credentials(),
                options=self.copy_options)
            )
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("Error inserting file: %s", f)
            logger.error(str(e))
```
In this corrected version, logging is set up to provide visibility into the file being inserted and error handling is added to properly catch and log any potential errors related to the `cursor.execute` method.
