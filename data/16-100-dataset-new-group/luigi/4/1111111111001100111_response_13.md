## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Explanation for correction:
The bug occurred because the original function did not check if `self.columns` was `None` before trying to access its length. This caused a `TypeError` when `self.columns` was `None`. The suggested fix is to add a check for `self.columns` to be not `None` before accessing its length. The corrected version of the function now includes this check, ensuring that it only tries to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function addresses the root cause of the bug as described in the GitHub issue. It ensures that the `TypeError` will not occur when `self.columns` is `None`, and the function will run successfully even in such cases.
