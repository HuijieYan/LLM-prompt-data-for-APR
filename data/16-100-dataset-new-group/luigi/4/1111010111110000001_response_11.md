The buggy function `copy` is failing with a TypeError because it is trying to retrieve the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. The function is supposed to construct a `COPY` SQL statement, and when `self.columns` is `None`, it should default to an empty string for `colnames`. However, the current implementation does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to retrieve its length. If it is `None`, then `colnames` should be set to an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the TypeError from occurring.

This corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test.
