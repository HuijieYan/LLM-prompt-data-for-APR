## Explanation:
The bug in the original function `copy` arises from the incorrect invocation of the `self._credentials()` method and `self.copy_options` attribute. The function `self._credentials()` should be called to obtain the Redshift credentials, and the `self.copy_options` should be called to get the options for the data copy. 

The bug is caused by not calling the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` functions to obtain the required credentials and options for the data copy. Instead, they are passed as if they are already computed values.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by calling the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` functions at the appropriate locations to obtain the credentials and options dynamically.

In the corrected version, the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are called to obtain the required credentials and options for the data copy, and then these values are used in the `cursor.execute` statement to properly execute the `COPY` command.

The corrected version ensures that the correct credentials and options are used for the data copy operation.
