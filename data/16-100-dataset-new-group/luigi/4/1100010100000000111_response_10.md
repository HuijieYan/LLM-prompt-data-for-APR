## The bug in the function:
The bug in the function is that when self.columns is None, the function still tries to get the length of self.columns, causing a TypeError. This is in line with the GitHub issue description where it mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with columns=None fails due to the TypeError.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by checking if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length. This will prevent the TypeError when self.columns is None.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of self.columns is only accessed when it's not None, which resolves the issue discussed in the GitHub problem.
