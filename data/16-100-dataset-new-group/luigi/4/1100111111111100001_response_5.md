### Bug Analysis
The bug occurred due to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error, which was caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition. The test is failing because the `columns` parameter is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, and the buggy function does not handle this case properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` before trying to access its length, we can handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without resulting in a `TypeError`.
