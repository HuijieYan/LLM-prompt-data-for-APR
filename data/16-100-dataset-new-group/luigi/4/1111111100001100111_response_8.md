The bug in the provided function is likely due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` causing an error when `self.columns` is None. This is consistent with the GitHub issue description, which mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` fails in luigi 2.7.1.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is None, we should handle this case appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description.
