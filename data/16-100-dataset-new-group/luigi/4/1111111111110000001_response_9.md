The error is occurring in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The failing test is `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file.

The problem is in the `copy` function where it is trying to check the length of `self.columns`. However, when the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is created with `columns=None`, it causes a TypeError when the `copy` function attempts to check the length of `None`.

To fix this bug, we can implement a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to check its length. This prevents the TypeError that was occurring when `columns` was `None`.
