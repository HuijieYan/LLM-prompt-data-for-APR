The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the way it handles the `self.columns` attribute. The function tries to concatenate the column names if they are provided, but fails when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs when `columns=None` is used to prohibit table creation, resulting in the TypeError. The suggested solution is to modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix the bug, the condition for concatenating `colnames` should be updated to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This version of the function checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to concatenate the column names, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report.
