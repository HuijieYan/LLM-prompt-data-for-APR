The buggy function is failing to handle the case where the columns parameter is None. This is causing the TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len() error. The bug is related to the if statement that assumes self.columns is not None but doesn't explicitly handle the case when it is None.

To fix this bug, we can modify the if statement to explicitly check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will properly handle the case when self.columns is None and prevent the TypeError from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
