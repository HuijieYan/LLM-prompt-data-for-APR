The potential error location within the `copy` function is the following line:
```python
colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
```
The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. The failing test is calling the `copy` function with `columns=None`, which is not handled properly in the function.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to join its elements. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should set `colnames` to an empty string. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the line causing the error to handle the `None` case explicitly.

Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this correction, the `copy` function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` correctly.
