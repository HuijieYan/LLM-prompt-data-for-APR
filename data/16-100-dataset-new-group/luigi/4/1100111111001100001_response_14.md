The bug in the provided code is that the `copy_options` function is not being called to retrieve the options for the `COPY` statement. This results in the `options` variable being an empty string, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to retrieve the options for the `COPY` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to retrieve the options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `copy_options` function is called to retrieve the options, and the returned value is assigned to the `options` variable, which is then used in the `COPY` statement.

This should fix the bug in the original code and make it pass the failing test.
