The buggy function `copy` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` fails when `self.columns` is `None`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the file `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` triggers the error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

The root cause of the bug is that the `copy` function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when attempting to call `len` on a `NoneType`.

To fix the bug, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` must be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

The corrected version of the `copy` function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified condition to handle None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By modifying the condition to handle `None` values in `self.columns`, the bug will be fixed and the failing test should pass without triggering the `TypeError`. The corrected version addresses the issue posted in GitHub by ensuring that an explicit check for `None` is included in the condition.
