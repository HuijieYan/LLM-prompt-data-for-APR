The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the case when the `columns` parameter is `None`, resulting in an empty `colnames`. This causes an extra comma to appear in the `COPY` statement, which leads to a failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None: # Add a check for non-None columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will properly handle the case when `columns` is `None`, and the failing test should pass.
