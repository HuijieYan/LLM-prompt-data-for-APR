## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` in the `copy` function, we can ensure that the `len` function is only called when `self.columns` is not None. This would prevent the TypeError that occurred when `self.columns` was None. This correction aligns with the GitHub issue's suggestion.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
