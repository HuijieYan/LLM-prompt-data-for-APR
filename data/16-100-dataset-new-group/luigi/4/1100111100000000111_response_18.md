The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which throws a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is set to `None` to prohibit table creation. 

To fix the bug:
1. We need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.
2. We can use the `and` operator for this purpose, which will short-circuit and only evaluate the length if `self.columns` is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
