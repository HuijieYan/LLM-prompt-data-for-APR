The error is occurring in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. This method is trying to access the `columns` attribute of the class, and when it is None, the code tries to get the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If it is `None`, the condition `if self.columns` will evaluate to `False`, and the code inside the block will not be executed. This should prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
