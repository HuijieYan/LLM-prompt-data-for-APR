The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to a TypeError. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is testing the scenario where the `columns` parameter is None. The failing test expects that in such a case, the `colnames` variable should be an empty string, but the buggy function does not handle this case properly and results in a TypeError.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is None, the buggy function attempts to call `len(None)`, which results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we should add a condition to check if `self.columns` is None and assign an empty string to `colnames` in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Add a condition to check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will handle the case where `self.columns` is None and set `colnames` to an empty string, which will resolve the TypeError encountered in the failing test.
