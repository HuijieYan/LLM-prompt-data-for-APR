The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for executing a Redshift COPY command.

The potential error location is identified in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line is causing an error when `self.columns` is `None`.

The cause of the bug is explained by the GitHub issue, which states that when `self.columns` is not provided (i.e., set to `None` to prohibit table creation), the function fails with a `TypeError` due to the check for the length of `None`.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This modification checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this modification, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, thus resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
