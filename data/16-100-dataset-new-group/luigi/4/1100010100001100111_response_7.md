The cause of the bug is due to the buggy function not handling the case when self.columns is None, which results in the TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). 

To fix the bug, we should check if self.columns is not None before trying to access its length. If it is None, we should set colnames to an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if self.columns is not None before trying to access its length, and sets colnames to an empty string if it is None. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
