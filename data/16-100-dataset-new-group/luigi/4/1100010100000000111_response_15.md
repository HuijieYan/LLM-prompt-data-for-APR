## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The if statement checking the length of self.columns may be causing the TypeError if self.columns is None.
2. The way the colnames variable is being constructed could also be a potential source of error.


## Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing Redshift COPY jobs to fail in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided. This is due to the if statement that checks the length of self.columns, which leads to a TypeError if self.columns is None. The GitHub issue also points out that the way the colnames variable is constructed may be causing issues when columns are not provided.


## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the if statement to handle the case when self.columns is None, and also modify the way the colnames variable is constructed to handle the situation when columns are not provided.


## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that self.columns is not None before checking its length. We have also modified the colnames variable construction to only execute when self.columns is not None. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
