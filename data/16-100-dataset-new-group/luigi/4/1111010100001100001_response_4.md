The bug in the provided function is likely due to the use of an incorrect SQL query to copy data from S3 to Redshift. The `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string regardless of the actual columns provided, and it is not being used in the SQL query. This can result in an error when trying to execute the SQL query.

To fix the bug, the `colnames` variable should be properly constructed from the provided columns and used in the SQL query to specify the columns being copied.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,  # Include colnames in the query
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing the `colnames` variable. If the `self.columns` has values, we construct the `colnames` variable by joining the column names. Then, we include `colnames` in the SQL query to specify the columns being copied.
