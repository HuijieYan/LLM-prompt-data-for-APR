The error message indicates that the buggy function `copy` is trying to access the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This means that `self.columns` is `None` instead of a list, causing the buggy function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `columns` attribute is a list before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` before trying to access its length, the function will now handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
