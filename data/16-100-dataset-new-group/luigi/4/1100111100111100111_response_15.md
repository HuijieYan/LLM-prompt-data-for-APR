### Correction

The bug in the `copy` function is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which causes an error when `self.columns` is `None`. To fix this, we need to modify this comparison to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then check its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed the bug here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this fix, the comparison `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` ensures that the code won't throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" by modifying the comparison logic to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None`.
