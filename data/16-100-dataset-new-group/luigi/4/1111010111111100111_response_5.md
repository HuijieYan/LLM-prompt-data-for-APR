The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is caused by a type error when checking the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` in the failing test case. The bug occurs for the specific case where `self.columns` is `None`, causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we ensure that the code only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
