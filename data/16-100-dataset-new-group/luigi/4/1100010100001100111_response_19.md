The bug in the provided function is related to the handling of the 'self.columns' attribute. When 'self.columns' is set to None, the buggy function attempts to iterate over it and causes a TypeError due to the 'len(None)' operation.

To fix the bug, we need to check if 'self.columns' is not None before attempting to iterate over it in the colnames generation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the check 'if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:', we ensure that the 'self.columns' attribute is not None before attempting to iterate over it. This change resolves the issue of the TypeError when 'self.columns' is set to None.
