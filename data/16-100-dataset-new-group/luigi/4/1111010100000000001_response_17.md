The potential error in the `copy` function lies in the `creds` parameter within the `cursor.execute` call. The function is using `self._credentials()` to get the credentials, but it doesn't handle the case where both key-based and role-based credentials are provided. 

This could lead to unexpected behavior where role-based credentials are used, even if key-based credentials are also provided.

To fix the bug, we should first check if role-based credentials are provided, and only use them if key-based credentials are not provided. If both are provided, an error should be raised to indicate the conflicting credentials.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    if self.key_based_credentials and self.role_based_credentials:
        raise ValueError("Both key-based and role-based credentials are provided. Please specify only one type of credentials.")
    
    creds = self._credentials() if not self.role_based_credentials else ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=creds,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we check if both key-based and role-based credentials are provided. If they are, we raise a `ValueError`. We then set the `creds` variable based on the presence of role-based credentials. If there are no role-based credentials, then we use the key-based credentials by calling `self._credentials()`. If role-based credentials are provided, then `creds` is set to an empty string. This ensures that we only use role-based credentials if they are explicitly provided and not in conflict with key-based credentials.
