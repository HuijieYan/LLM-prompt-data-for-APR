The buggy function is missing an additional check for the `columns` parameter before constructing the `colnames` variable. This results in an empty string for `colnames` when `self.columns` is `None`, which causes the `COPY` statement in the `cursor.execute` call to have an incorrect format.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing `colnames` and only include it in the `COPY` statement if it has values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `colnames` variable will only be constructed if `self.columns` is not `None`, allowing the `COPY` statement to be correctly formatted.
