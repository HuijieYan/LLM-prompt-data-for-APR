The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing issues when the `columns` attribute is set to None, which is leading to a TypeError. The issue on GitHub also confirms the bug and suggests a possible solution by changing the conditional statement for checking the length of `self.columns`.

The potential error location is the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which throws a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This change will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
