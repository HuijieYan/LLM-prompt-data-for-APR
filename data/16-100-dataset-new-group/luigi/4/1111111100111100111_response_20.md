## Corrected Version

```python
def _credentials(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

def copy_options(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Call the function copy_options
        )
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This change ensures that the TypeError caused by attempting to get the length of a NoneType is avoided. Additionally, it ensures that the `copy_options()` function is called correctly by adding parentheses after `self.copy_options`.
