        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=options)
        )
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that the `copy_options` function is not being called to get the `options` that should be included in the `cursor.execute` call. Instead, it's just referencing the function itself. Additionally, the `_credentials` function is being called correctly to get the credentials.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Call the `copy_options` function to get the copy options that should be included in the `cursor.execute` call.
2. Use the `options` variable in the `cursor.execute` call to include the copy options.

The corrected version of the `copy` function addresses the bug by calling the `copy_options` function to get the options, and then using the `options` variable in the `cursor.execute` call.
