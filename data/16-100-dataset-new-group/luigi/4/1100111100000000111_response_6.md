To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to address the issue with `self.columns` being `None` which causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when trying to retrieve the length of `self.columns`.

The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to modify the line 
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
to
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This change ensures that we only attempt to retrieve the length of `self.columns` if `self.columns` is not None.

The corrected version of the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the bug causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error should be fixed.
