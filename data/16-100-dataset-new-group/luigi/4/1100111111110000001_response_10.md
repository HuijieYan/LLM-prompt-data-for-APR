The bug in the `copy` function arises from the fact that the `columns` attribute is expected to be a list, but it is None. This causes an error when trying to get the length of `None` in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If it is None, we will need to handle this case separately. 

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If it is None, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This way, the function can handle both cases where `self.columns` is a list or None without throwing an error. This should fix the bug and the function should now pass the failing test.
