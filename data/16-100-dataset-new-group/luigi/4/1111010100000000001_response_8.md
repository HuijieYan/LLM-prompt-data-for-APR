Potential errors in the buggy function:
1. It is missing the `logger` declaration, which will cause a `NameError`.
2. The `colnames` variable is being used before it is defined.

Cause of the bug:
The `logger` is used but not declared within the `copy` method, causing a `NameError` and the `colnames` variable is being used before it is defined, causing an `UnboundLocalError`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `logger` module at the top of the file.
2. Define the `colnames` variable before using it in the `cursor.execute` method.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
import logging  # Import the logger module

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    # (existing class code)

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Declare the logger
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''  # Define the colnames variable
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```
In the corrected version, the `logger` module is imported, and the `logger` is declared within the `copy` method. Additionally, the `colnames` variable is defined before using it in the `cursor.execute` method.
