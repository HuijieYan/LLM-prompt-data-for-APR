The bug in the `copy` function is causing a TypeError when trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is None. This issue has been reported in a GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The suggested solution is to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` statement checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

With this correction, the `copy` function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is None without causing the TypeError. The corrected version will pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
