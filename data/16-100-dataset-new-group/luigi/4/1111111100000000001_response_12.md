The potential error locations within the buggy function are the use of `self.columns` without checking if it is None or empty, and the use of `self.copy_options` without calling it as a function.

The cause of the bug is that the `self.columns` may be None or empty, causing an error in the `if` statement, and the `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not None or empty before using it, and we need to call `self.copy_options()` as a function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
In the corrected version, we added a check for `self.columns` to ensure it's not None before using it, and we also called `self.copy_options()` as a function.
