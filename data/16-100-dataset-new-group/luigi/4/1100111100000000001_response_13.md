The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. The use of self.copy_options without parentheses, which suggests that it's a function but it's actually a method and should be called as self.copy_options().
2. The missing parentheses in the cursor.execute() call before passing the options argument.

The cause of the bug is that the copy_options method is not being called correctly, and the options argument is not being passed correctly to cursor.execute.

To fix the bug, the copy_options method should be called with parentheses, and the options argument should be passed with the correct method call.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
