The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None, which causes a TypeError when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. This bug is related to a GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The issue description points out that the root cause is related to a specific line of code that doesn't handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we should modify the line as suggested in the GitHub issue, to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before trying to use it. This will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and has a length greater than 0
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will now properly handle the case when `self.columns` is None, preventing the TypeError and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
