## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`. The issue is related to the `columns` parameter being set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

## Bug Location
The issue is likely located in the `copy` function where it attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is `None`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `copy` function not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This triggers a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we can proceed with the original logic.

## Bug Fix

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code will only proceed with getting the length of `self.columns` if `self.columns` is not `None`. This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub bug report and should make the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` pass.
