The bug in the provided function is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which causes an error when `self.columns` is `None`. The GitHub issue also confirms this and suggests a solution to check if `self.columns` is not None before applying the `len` function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if it is not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, resolving the bug.
