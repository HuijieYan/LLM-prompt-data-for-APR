To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, we need to modify the condition checking for the existence of columns. 

The bug is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which will throw an error if `self.columns` is `None`. The issue reported on GitHub also indicates the same problem.

To fix the bug, we will modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will now properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, and the failing test should now pass.
