The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line, which raises a TypeError when `self.columns` is set to `None`. This issue is reflected in the GitHub post where the user suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` as a possible solution.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. If it is None, we can assume that there are no columns to be specified, and therefore the `colnames` should remain as an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`, and it will not attempt to access the length of `None`, eliminating the TypeError.
