The issue is related to the bug in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The failing test is due to a TypeError being raised when `self.columns` is None.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not check whether `self.columns` is None before trying to get the length of it. This causes a TypeError when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this check in place, the `copy` method will only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not None, avoiding the TypeError. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
