## Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the use of `self.columns` without checking if it's None in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The GitHub issue details that when `columns` are set to `None`, it causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

## Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class where it attempts to use `self.columns` without checking if it's `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not account for the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to get the length of `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `copy` function should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to use it.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
