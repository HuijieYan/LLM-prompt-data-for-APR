The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `self.columns` attribute being set to `None` and then the code tries to use `len()` on it, which results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The `colnames` variable is being set as an empty string, which is the expected behavior when `self.columns` is `None`, so the bug is likely in the condition checking `len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before performing the `len()` operation. If it is `None`, we should set `colnames` to an empty string without attempting to use `len()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function should now handle `None` values for `self.columns` and not raise the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
