The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing a TypeError when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. This is related to the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`. The error message shows that the TypeError occurs at line 338 of `redshift.py` when attempting to check the length of `self.columns`.

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" describes the same problem, suggesting a potential solution to change the line that checks the length of `self.columns` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to safely handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a TypeError. We should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the TypeError. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
