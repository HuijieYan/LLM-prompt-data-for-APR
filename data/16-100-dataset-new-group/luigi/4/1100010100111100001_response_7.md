The buggy function is failing because it is trying to perform a length check on the 'columns' attribute, which is of type 'NoneType'. This is causing a TypeError.

To fix this, we need to check if the 'columns' attribute is not None before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before trying to access the length of the 'columns' attribute, we prevent the TypeError that was occurring in the original buggy function.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
