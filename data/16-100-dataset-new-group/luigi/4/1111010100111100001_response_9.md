The bug in the `copy` function is causing a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is `NoneType`. This is occurring at line 338 in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly. This causes the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement to fail with a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to check whether `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before checking its length, the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This should address the bug and make the function work as expected.
