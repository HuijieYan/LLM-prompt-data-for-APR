The buggy function is failing with a TypeError because it is trying to find the length of a NoneType object in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

The input parameter `self.columns` seems to be of type `None` which is causing the error.

To fix this bug, we can modify the if condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before finding its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before finding length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only accessed when it is not None.

This should fix the TypeError and make the function work as expected.
