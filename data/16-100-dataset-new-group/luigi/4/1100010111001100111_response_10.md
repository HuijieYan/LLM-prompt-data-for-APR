The bug in the `copy` function is related to the handling of the `columns` input parameter. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code attempts to call `len()` on it, which results in a `TypeError`. This bug is causing the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` from `redshift_test.py`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to use it. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
