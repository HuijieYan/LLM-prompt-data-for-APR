The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The line `if len(self.columns) > 0` is checking the length of `self.columns`, which may be causing an error if `self.columns` is `None`.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is `None`. As a result, when `self.columns` is `None`, the code throws a `TypeError` because `NoneType` has no length.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. If it is `None`, we should handle it gracefully without trying to find the length of `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to find its length. This should fix the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
