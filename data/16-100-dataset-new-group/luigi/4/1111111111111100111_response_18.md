The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The issue arises when the `columns` attribute is `None` and the `len` function is called on it. This triggers a `TypeError` because `None` has no length.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a DummyS3CopyToTableKey with `columns` set to `None`. When the `copy` function is called, it attempts to check the length of `self.columns`, leading to the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without attempting to call `len` on it. A simple solution is to check for `None` explicitly and bypass the length check in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This change allows the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and avoids the `TypeError` that was occurring. With this correction, the failing test should pass, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
