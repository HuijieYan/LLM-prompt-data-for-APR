The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns` in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to check its length.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

I added a check for `self.columns` before trying to check its length, and then I only proceed with constructing `colnames` if `self.columns` is not `None`. Additionally, I changed `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to call the `copy_options` function, assuming it should return a string of options to be included in the `COPY` command.
