The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` parameter when it is set to `None`. 

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` initializes the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None` and then calls the `run` method on it. This results in the `copy` function being called with `cursor` and `f` arguments. Inside the `copy` function, the `columns` parameter is checked for its length, and when it is set to `None`, the buggy behavior occurs.

The GitHub issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides details about a possible cause and a suggested fix. It points to a specific line in the code, where it's proposed to change the condition from `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix the bug, we should update the condition in the `copy` function as suggested in the GitHub issue and also handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. Additionally, we need to handle the `copy_options` method properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. We also call the `copy_options` method with parentheses to ensure it is properly executed.

With these changes, the `copy` function should handle the case when `columns` is `None` without resulting in a `TypeError`. This should address the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
