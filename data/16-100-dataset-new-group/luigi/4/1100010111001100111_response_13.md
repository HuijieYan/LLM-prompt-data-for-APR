Based on the provided information, the issue seems to stem from the `self.columns` attribute being `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, which causes the TypeError in the `copy` function. The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` assumes that `self.columns` is always a list, leading to the TypeError when it is `None`.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, the issue of a TypeError occurring when `self.columns` is `None` should be resolved. This will ensure that the `colnames` variable is only constructed when `self.columns` is not `None`.

This change should resolve the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".
