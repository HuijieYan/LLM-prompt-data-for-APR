The bug in the provided code is that the `copy_options` function is not being called to obtain the options for the `COPY` command. Additionally, the `self._credentials()` function is being called incorrectly. The `options` variable is also not being used correctly in the `COPY` command.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to obtain the options and properly format the `options` variable in the `COPY` command. We also need to call the `_credentials` function correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    credentials = self._credentials()  # Call the _credentials function to obtain credentials
    options = self.copy_options()      # Call the copy_options function to obtain options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,   # Use the obtained credentials
        options=options      # Use the obtained options
    )
)
```

In the corrected version, we have called the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions to obtain the credentials and options, respectively. We then use these credentials and options in the `COPY` command.
