The error message indicates a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). This error is occurring at line 338 of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file, when the `copy` function is called and tries to access the length of `self.columns`, which is None.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None. This results in a TypeError when trying to access the length of None.

To fix this bug, the `copy` function should check if `self.columns` is None before trying to access its length. If it is None, the function should handle this case appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        else:
            colnames = ''  # Handle the case when self.columns is None
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

In the corrected version, I added a check for `self.columns` being None, and if it is None, I handle this case by setting `colnames` to an empty string. This should prevent the TypeError from occurring. With this correction, the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is None without throwing an error.
