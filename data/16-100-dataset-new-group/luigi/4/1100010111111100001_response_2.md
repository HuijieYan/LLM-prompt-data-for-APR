The buggy function is the `copy` method in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. It is failing during the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the file `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is being raised due to an attempt to perform the `len()` function on a `NoneType` object.

The `copy` method is designed to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute. In the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None` when creating the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance. When `len(self.columns)` is called within the `copy` method, a `TypeError` is raised because it is not possible to determine the length of a `None` object.

To fix the bug, the `copy` method should check whether the `columns` attribute is `None` before attempting to use it. If `columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable should also be set to an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` method will no longer raise a `TypeError` when the `columns` attribute is `None`.

By making this change, the corrected `copy` method now properly handles the case when `columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from being raised in the failing test.
