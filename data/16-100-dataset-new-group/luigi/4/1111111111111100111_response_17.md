To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. Currently, the function checks `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this, we should modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that we're only checking the length of `self.columns` when it's not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring. It addresses the issue reported on GitHub and should pass the failing test.
