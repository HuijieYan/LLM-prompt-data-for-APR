The cause of the bug is that when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, the buggy function still attempts to access its length, which results in a TypeError. This issue was reported on GitHub and the suggestion is to modify the line to check if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.

To fix the bug, we should modify the buggy function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the buggy function only attempts to access the length of `self.columns` if it exists, thereby preventing the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
