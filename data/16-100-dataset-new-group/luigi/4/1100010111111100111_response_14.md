The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. When `self.columns` is `None`, it causes a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length. This bug results in the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` due to the incorrect handling of `None` for the `columns` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will no longer throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, and the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass. This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to the failing Redshift COPY jobs when columns are not provided.
