The buggy function has a syntax error in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `colnames` variable is being used inside the `COPY` statement without handling the case when `colnames` is empty.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `colnames` is empty by checking if it has any values before including it in the `COPY` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if colnames:
        colnames = ' ' + colnames

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table}{colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a conditional check for `colnames` before including it in the `COPY` statement. If `colnames` is empty, it won't be included in the `COPY` statement, preventing the syntax error.
