The bug in the provided function is located in the `copy` method where it attempts to check the length of `self.columns`. Since `self.columns` is set to `None`, it raises a TypeError when attempting to get its length.

The fix for this bug is to modify the `if` statement to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length, resolving the TypeError issue.

This fix is in line with the GitHub issue's suggestion to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.
