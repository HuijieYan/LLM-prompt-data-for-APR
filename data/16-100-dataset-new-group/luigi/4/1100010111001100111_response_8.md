The bug in the `copy` function is related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute when it is set to `None`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is a result of this issue and has been reported in the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".

The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, causing the `len(self.columns)` expression to raise a `TypeError`. The buggy function does not handle this case correctly, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function should now handle the case of `self.columns` being `None` correctly and pass the failing test.
