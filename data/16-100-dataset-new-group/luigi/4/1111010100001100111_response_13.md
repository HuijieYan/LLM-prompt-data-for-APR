The potential error location is the line where the length of self.columns is checked using `len(self.columns)`, which could throw an error if self.columns is None.

The cause of the bug is that when columns are not provided, the length check `len(self.columns)` results in a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). This is in line with the GitHub issue description, where it is suggested to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when columns are not provided.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the length check to first check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
