The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `columns` attribute being `None`, which is causing a `TypeError` when the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` is evaluated.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to retrieve the length of the columns. We can use the `is not None` comparison to ensure that `self.columns` has a valid value before proceeding to use it.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `columns` attribute has a non-None value before attempting to use it.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
