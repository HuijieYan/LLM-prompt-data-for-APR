## The corrected version of the buggy function

## Explanation
The bug occurred because the original code did not handle the case where `self.columns` is None, leading to a `TypeError`. The failing test was designed to check for this specific scenario and resulted in the corresponding error message. The GitHub issue further confirmed the origin of the bug and provided a suggested solution, which was to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

A strategy for fixing the bug was to modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to include a check for its existence. The corrected version of the function includes this modification, using `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the `NoneType` error.

This corrected version of the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is None without causing a `TypeError`, thereby passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
