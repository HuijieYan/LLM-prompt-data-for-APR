The bug in the `copy` function is likely due to the `colnames` variable being initialized as an empty string and then not being used in the `COPY` query. Additionally, the `colnames` variable should include the column names enclosed in parentheses if the `self.columns` list is not empty.

To fix this bug, we need to properly construct the `colnames` string and include it in the `COPY` query.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = "(" + ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns]) + ")"

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the `self.columns` list is not empty, and if so, construct the `colnames` string with the column names enclosed in parentheses. Then, we include the `colnames` variable in the `COPY` query.
