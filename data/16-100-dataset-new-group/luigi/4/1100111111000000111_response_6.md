Based on the provided information, the bug in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` when `self.columns` is None. This is identified in the failing test, which is part of a GitHub issue with the title "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".

The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This will check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before trying to access its length directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` has been updated to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None. This change addresses the root cause of the bug and aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
