The bug in the given `copy` function is causing a `TypeError` due to the comparison of `NoneType` with the length of the columns. The error message clearly indicates that the variable `self.columns` is of type `NoneType` and therefore the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0` results in a `TypeError`. The buggy function is also trying to call the function `self.copy_options()` without parentheses, which should be fixed.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, and also call the `self.copy_options()` function with parentheses.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the NoneType, and we also fixed the call to `self.copy_options` by adding parentheses `self.copy_options()`. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue and the function should now pass the failing test.
