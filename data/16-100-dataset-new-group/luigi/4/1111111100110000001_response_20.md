The bug in the `copy` function is causing a TypeError because it is attempting to call `len()` on the `self.columns` attribute without first checking if it is None. The error message indicates that `self.columns` is of type 'NoneType' and it does not have a len() method.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute(
        """
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None and` check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before calling `len()`, we can prevent the TypeError from occurring. This corrected version of the `copy` function should pass the failing test.
