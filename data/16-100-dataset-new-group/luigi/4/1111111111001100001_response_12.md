The bug in the provided function is that the `copy_options` variable is being called as a function instead of a string. This is causing the failing test case.

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` variable should be called as a function to return the desired string value, instead of calling it directly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call copy_options as a function to obtain the string value
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
