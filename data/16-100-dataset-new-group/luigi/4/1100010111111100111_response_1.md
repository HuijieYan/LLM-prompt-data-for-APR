The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the scenario where the `self.columns` parameter is None, which leads to the TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). This issue has been reported on GitHub with a suggested solution to modify the conditional statement to handle the None type.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement in the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. We can use the `and` operator to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will properly handle the case where `self.columns` is None, and the fix should resolve the reported GitHub issue as well as pass the failing test.
