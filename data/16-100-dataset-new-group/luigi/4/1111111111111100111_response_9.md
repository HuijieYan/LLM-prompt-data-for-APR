The cause of the bug in the provided function is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the function tries to check its length using `len(self.columns)`, which results in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` has no length.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, which fixes the bug. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
