With the correction provided in the `copy` function, the issue reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved, and the failing test should pass. By checking the length of `self.columns` after ensuring it is not None, we can prevent the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` from occurring and ensure that the function behaves as expected even when `columns` are not provided.
