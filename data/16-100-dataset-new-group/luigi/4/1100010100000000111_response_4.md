## Analysis
The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `redshift.py` file in the `luigi/contrib` directory. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the failure of Redshift COPY jobs when the `columns` parameter is set to `None`.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error in the buggy function is in the line that checks the length of the `columns` parameter. When the `columns` parameter is `None`, it causes a TypeError.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where the `columns` parameter is set to `None`. As a result, when the `columns` are `None`, the function attempts to call `len(None)`, which causes a TypeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by adding a check for the `columns` parameter to see if it is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a check has been added to verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the TypeError when `columns` is `None`.
