The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `if` statement that checks the length of `self.columns`.
2. The `cursor.execute` method where the `colnames` and `options` are being used.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the `if` statement `if len(self.columns) > 0` throws a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length. This issue was reported in the GitHub issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", where it was suggested to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, the `if` statement should be modified to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length, and the `colnames` and `options` should be properly formatted within the `cursor.execute` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` statement first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. Additionally, the `copy_options` method should be called with `()` to ensure it returns the desired options for the `COPY` command.
