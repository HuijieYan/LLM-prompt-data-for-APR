## Fixing the bug

The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The bug is caused by the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when the `columns` are set to `None`. This issue has been reported in a GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", where a possible solution has been suggested to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if it is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` and will fix the bug.

With this corrected version, the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass without any errors, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
