The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when `self.columns` is set to `None`. The issue is causing a `TypeError` because it tries to call `len` on a `NoneType` object. This bug has been reported in a GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".

To resolve this bug, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` should be updated to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and pass the failing test, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
