To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` method to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. The issue on GitHub also suggests a possible solution by checking if `self.columns` is not None before calling `len(self.columns) > 0`.

Additionally, we need to update the `copy` method to correctly call the `copy_options` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that it does not throw an error when `self.columns` is `None`. We also updated the call to `copy_options` by adding `()`, as it is a method and needs to be explicitly called.

This should resolve the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None` and ensure that the `copy_options` method is correctly invoked.
