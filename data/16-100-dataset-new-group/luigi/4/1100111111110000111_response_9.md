The bug in the `copy` function is that it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The failing test is trying to run the `copy` function with `columns=None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to execute `len(self.columns)`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We can use the following strategy to fix the bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function should now correctly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and the failing test should pass. This change aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue.
