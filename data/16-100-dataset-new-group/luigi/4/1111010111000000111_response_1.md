## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This is causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

## Identified Potential Error Locations
1. The `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The `COPY` statement is not handling the case when `colnames` is empty.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `copy` function not properly handling the scenario when `self.columns` is `None`. This results in an empty `colnames` variable, but the `COPY` statement does not handle the case of an empty `colnames`.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The fix should involve checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before creating the `colnames` string. Additionally, the `COPY` statement should be modified to handle the case where `colnames` is empty.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''  # Set colnames to empty string if self.columns is None

    # Handle the case when colnames is empty
    if colnames:
        colnames = " " + colnames  # Add a space before colnames if it's not empty

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table}{colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function properly handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` and ensures that the `COPY` statement handles the empty `colnames` appropriately. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
