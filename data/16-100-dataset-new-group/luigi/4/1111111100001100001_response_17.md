The bug in the given function is that the `self.copy_options` variable is intended to be a function but is being used as a string in the `cursor.execute` call.

The correct strategy for fixing the bug is to call the `self.copy_options` function to get the actual options and pass the result to the `cursor.execute` call.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
        options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to get the actual options
        
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=options)  # Use the retrieved options here
        )
```

In this corrected version, we call the `self.copy_options` function to get the actual options and store them in a variable called `options`, which is then used in the `cursor.execute` call. This ensures that the correct options are used for the copy operation.
