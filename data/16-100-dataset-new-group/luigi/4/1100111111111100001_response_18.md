The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because `self.columns` is of type `NoneType`, which does not support the `len` function.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check for `self.columns is not None` before checking its length, we ensure that we only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
