## Explanation of the bug

The bug in the `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is related to the `self.columns` parameter. When the `columns` parameter is not provided (i.e., it is set to `None`), the buggy function tries to access its length using `len(self.columns)`, which results in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` has no length. This bug causes Redshift COPY jobs to fail when columns are not provided.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the `self.columns` parameter is not `None` before trying to access its length using the `len` function. This can be achieved by adding a check for `None` before checking the length.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Add a check for None before checking the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, the corrected version of the function ensures that the Redshift COPY jobs do not fail when columns are not provided. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
