The potential error location within the buggy function is the if statement checking the length of self.columns.

The bug is caused by the if statement not properly handling cases where self.columns is None, leading to a TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

To fix the bug, we can modify the if statement to check if self.columns exists and has a length greater than 0.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and has length > 0
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that self.columns is checked for existence before trying to get its length, avoiding the TypeError when self.columns is None.
