The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing an error due to the `columns` being `None`. The issue arises when trying to get the length of `NoneType` which results in a `TypeError`. The related test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` fails due to this bug.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to check if the `columns` are not `None` before getting its length. The suggested fix in the GitHub issue is correct, and we should modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid the `TypeError` when `columns` are `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the bug should be resolved, and the related test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass without any errors.
