### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length. This addresses the issue that was causing the TypeError when `self.columns` was None.

This approach aligns with the suggested solution from the GitHub issue, which also proposes the use of `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

By making this change, the corrected function should now handle cases where `self.columns` is None without causing a TypeError.
