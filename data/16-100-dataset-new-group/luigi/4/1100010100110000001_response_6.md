The buggy function `copy` is incomplete and does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, which results in a TypeError when trying to check the length.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check for `self.columns` being `None` and handle it accordingly. We can simply set `colnames` as an empty string when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Add a conditional check for self.columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will no longer throw a TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.
