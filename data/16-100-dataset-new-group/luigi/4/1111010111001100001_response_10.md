The bug in the `copy` function is due to the `colnames` variable not being set properly when `self.columns` is `None`. The `colnames` variable is used in the `cursor.execute` call to construct the SQL query for the `COPY` statement, so if it is not set correctly, it can cause the query to be invalid and fail.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is truthy (not None or empty) before setting `colnames`. If `self.columns` is None, `colnames` is set to an empty string.

This change will ensure that the `COPY` statement is constructed correctly even when `self.columns` is None, and the function should now pass the failing test.
