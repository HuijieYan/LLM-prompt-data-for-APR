The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The issue is that the `columns` attribute is None, and the code tries to get the length of the `columns` attribute.

The `columns` attribute is used to construct the `colnames` variable, which is then used in the `cursor.execute` call. Because the `columns` attribute is None, trying to get its length results in a `TypeError` as a `NoneType` object has no length.

To fix this bug, we should check if the `columns` attribute is None before attempting to get its length, and set `colnames` to an empty string in this case.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The corrected version includes a check for the `columns` attribute before constructing the `colnames` variable. It sets `colnames` to an empty string if `self.columns` is None, preventing the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
