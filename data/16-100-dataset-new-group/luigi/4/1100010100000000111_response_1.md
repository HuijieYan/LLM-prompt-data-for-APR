The bug in the `copy` function is identified as attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None first. This causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is None. The GitHub issue further explains that the bug occurs when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not None. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
