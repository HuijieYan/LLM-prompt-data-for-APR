The bug in the provided code is that the `COPY` command is not correctly formatted. The `colnames` variable is being used without checking if it has any value, which can cause issues with the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `colnames` has any value before including it in the `COPY` command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(copy_query)
```

In the corrected version, we check if `colnames` has any value before including it in the `COPY` command using the ternary operator. This will ensure that the SQL query is correctly formatted and prevent any issues related to an empty `colnames`.
