The potential error locations in the provided buggy function are:
1. The usage of the self._credentials() function within the cursor.execute() call.
2. The usage of self.copy_options without calling it as a function.

The cause of the bug is that the _credentials and copy_options functions are being called without the appropriate function call syntax. They should have '()' at the end to indicate that they are functions being called.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the _credentials and copy_options functions are called correctly and that their return values are used appropriately within the cursor.execute() call.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the _credentials and copy_options functions are called with '()' to indicate that they are functions being executed.
