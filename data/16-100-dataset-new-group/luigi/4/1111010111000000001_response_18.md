The cause of the bug is that the function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None. When `self.columns` is None, the variable `colnames` is a empty string, which results in an invalid SQL query in the `cursor.execute` statement.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should first check if `self.columns` is not None. If it is not None, then `colnames` should be constructed using the column names. If it is None, `colnames` should remain an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `copy` function will handle the case where `self.columns` is None and construct the `COPY` statement appropriately. The corrected version should pass the failing test.
