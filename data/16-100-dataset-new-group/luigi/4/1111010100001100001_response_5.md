The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is being calculated, but it is not being used in the SQL query for the `COPY` command.

The bug is caused because the `colnames` variable is being calculated, but it is not being used in the SQL query for the `COPY` command.

To fix the bug, we need to include the `colnames` variable in the SQL query for the `COPY` command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we now check if `self.columns` has any value, and if it does, we include `colnames` in the SQL query for the `COPY` command. This should address the bug and ensure that the `colnames` are included in the `COPY` command when needed.
