            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

### Explanation
The bug in the original code was due to calling the `copy_options` function without parentheses, resulting in passing the function reference instead of calling the function and passing its output to the SQL query.

The corrected version adds the parentheses `()` to `self.copy_options` to ensure the function is called and its return value is used in the SQL query.

Additionally, the bug involved handling the `columns` attribute. The corrected version includes a check for `self.columns is not None` before checking its length to prevent potential NoneType errors.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now work as expected and pass the failing test.
