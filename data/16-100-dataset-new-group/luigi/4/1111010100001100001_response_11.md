The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string regardless of whether `self.columns` is provided, resulting in an incorrect SQL query.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing the `colnames` string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This fix ensures that the `colnames` variable is only constructed if `self.columns` is not empty, preventing the bug where an empty string is always used for `colnames`.
