## Analysis
The buggy function is `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue is related to the `columns` parameter being None, causing a TypeError.

## Error Location
The potential error location is in the `copy` function where it checks the length of `self.columns` without validating if `self.columns` is not None.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `copy` function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` passes `None` as the `columns` parameter to `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task and expects the `COPY` SQL statement to be executed with an empty `colnames`. However, the current implementation does not handle the case when `columns` is None, leading to a TypeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. We should check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
