The bug in the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

By making this fix, the issue reported on GitHub related to Redshift COPY failing when columns are not provided will also be resolved. This change ensures that the function handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test provided.
