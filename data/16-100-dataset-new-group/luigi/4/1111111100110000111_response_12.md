The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `copy` is attempting to retrieve the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This is due to the if condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to retrieve its length.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have added a condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `len(self.columns)` is only called when `self.columns` is not None. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is None.
