The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not properly handle the case when self.columns is None. This causes the error when trying to call len(self.columns) in the buggy function's logic.

To fix the bug, we can modify the buggy function to explicitly check if self.columns is not None before attempting to use len(self.columns).

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will check if self.columns is not None before performing the len() operation, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the function to handle the case when self.columns is None without causing an error.
