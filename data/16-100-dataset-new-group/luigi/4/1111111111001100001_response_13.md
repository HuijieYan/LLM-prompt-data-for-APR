The bug in the `copy` function appears to be related to how the `copy_options` method is called. The `copy_options` method is expected to be a function, but it is being treated as a property, which is resulting in a TypeError. 

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` method should be called as a function by adding parentheses at the end of the method name.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed method call
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function should now be able to properly execute the `COPY` command without raising a TypeError, passing the failing test.
