The buggy function `copy` has a few potential error locations:
1. The `colnames` variable is being used inside the `cursor.execute` statement but it is not being properly formatted or handled when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The `options` variable is being passed to the `cursor.execute` statement, but it is not being properly handled when it is an empty string.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable is not being properly handled, resulting in an empty string being passed to the `cursor.execute` statement. Similarly, the `options` parameter is also not being properly handled when it is an empty string.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the cases where `self.columns` and `self.copy_options` are `None` or empty strings, and properly format the `colnames` and `options` variables before passing them to the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    options = self.copy_options() if self.copy_options else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by setting `colnames` to an empty string. We also handle the case where `self.copy_options` is an empty string by setting the `options` variable to an empty string. This should ensure that the `cursor.execute` statement is properly formatted and the test should pass.
