# The buggy function is the copy function within the S3CopyToTable class in the file luigi/contrib/redshift.py.

# Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The usage of self.columns without first checking if it's None or empty.
2. The usage of self._credentials() and self.copy_options without calling them as functions.

# The cause of the bug:
The bug causes a TypeError when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns = None to prohibit table creation. This is happening because the copy function does not check if self.columns is None or empty before attempting to use it. Additionally, there is a missing function call for self._credentials() and self.copy_options.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if self.columns is not None and has a length before attempting to use it in the colnames variable.
2. Call self._credentials() and self.copy_options as functions to ensure their return values are used appropriately.

# Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
