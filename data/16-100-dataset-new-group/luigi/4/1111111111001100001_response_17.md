The bug in the `copy` function is in the `cursor.execute` call. The `self.copy_options` is being passed as a function object, rather than calling the function to get its result. This causes the `copy_options` function to be treated as a string, leading to unexpected behavior.

A potential fix for this bug is to call the `copy_options` function to get its result before passing it to `cursor.execute`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    # Call the copy_options function to get its result
    options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

By calling the `copy_options` function to get its result and using that result in the `cursor.execute` call, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass.
