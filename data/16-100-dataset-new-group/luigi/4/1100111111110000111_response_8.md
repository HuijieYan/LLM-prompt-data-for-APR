Based on the information provided, the bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error, which is triggered when `self.columns` is None and the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0` is being performed.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement needs to be updated to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated conditional check to handle NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The updated conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` ensures that the code only attempts to calculate the length of `self.columns` if it is not None. This change will prevent the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when `self.columns` is None.

By making this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
