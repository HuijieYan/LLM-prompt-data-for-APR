The bug in the given function is caused by the comparison of the "columns" attribute of the self object with None. The error message "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" indicates that the "columns" attribute is None and thus cannot be used with the len() function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to check if the "columns" attribute is not None before using the len() function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
