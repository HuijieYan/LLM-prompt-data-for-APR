The potential error in the `copy` function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`. This line is causing an error when `self.columns` is None, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of a `NoneType` object.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This causes the function to fail when trying to determine the length of `self.columns`.

To fix the bug, we will modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is None, and the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass. This will also address the issue posted on GitHub related to Redshift COPY failing when columns are not provided.
