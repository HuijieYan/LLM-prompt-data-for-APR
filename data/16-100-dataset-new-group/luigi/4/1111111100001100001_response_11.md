The buggy function is the `copy` method inside the `S3CopyToTable` class. It is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift. The function constructs a query using the input parameters and then executes it using the `cursor`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The construction of the `COPY` query using string formatting.
2. The use of the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions.
3. The execution of the query using the `cursor`.

The cause of the bug is that the `COPY` query is not being constructed correctly, and there are issues with the usage of the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions. Additionally, the query is not being executed properly using the `cursor`.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Ensure that the `COPY` query is constructed accurately with the correct values for `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options`.
2. Correctly call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions to obtain the required values for the `COPY` query.
3. Execute the constructed query using the `cursor`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options)  # Use the obtained copy_options value
    )
```
In the corrected version, we call the `copy_options` function to obtain the options for the `COPY` query and use it in the query construction. Additionally, we fix the formatting of the `COPY` query and the use of the `cursor` to execute the query.

By making these changes, we address the potential issues identified and ensure that the `copy` method works correctly.
