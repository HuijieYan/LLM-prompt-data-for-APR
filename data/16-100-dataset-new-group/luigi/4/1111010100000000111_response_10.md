## Explanation:

The bug in the `copy` function is that it assumes `self.columns` will always exist, leading to a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is None. This bug causes the Redshift COPY job to fail when `columns` are not provided.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before using it in the `copy` function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Check if `self.columns` exists before attempting to use it.
- If `self.columns` exists, then check its length.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and has a length greater than 0
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This revised function first checks if `self.columns` exists and only accesses its length if it does. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided, and the Redshift COPY job should now work as expected.
