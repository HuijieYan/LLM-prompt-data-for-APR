The bug in the provided function is due to the comparison of `self.columns` with `None`. The error message indicates that `NoneType` has no length, which means `self.columns` is `None` and cannot be used with the `len()` function.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it's `None`, we can assign an empty list to `colnames` instead.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None`. If it's not `None`, then we proceed to construct `colnames`. Otherwise, we assign an empty string to `colnames`.

This fix should address the issue of comparing `NoneType` with the length function and ensure that the function runs without errors.
