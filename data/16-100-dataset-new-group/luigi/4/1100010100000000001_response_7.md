Explanation:
The bug in the original code is that the "{creds}" placeholder is being used in the SQL query, but the actual credentials are not being provided. This is causing the SQL query to fail when executed, leading to errors.

To fix this bug, we need to replace the "{creds}" placeholder with the actual AWS access key and secret key. We also need to provide the access key and secret key as parameters to the cursor.execute() function.

By making these changes, the bug will be fixed and the function should work as intended.

Additionally, it is assumed that the AWS access key and secret key are provided as attributes (aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key) of the class to which this function belongs. If they are not, these attributes need to be added or the credentials need to be obtained in another way.
