The reason for the error is that the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of the `columns` attribute, but `columns` is None. This is causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when the function tries to access `self.columns` in line 338.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# ...

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    ...
    """

    # ...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
    
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
