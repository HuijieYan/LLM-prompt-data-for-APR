The buggy function is failing because it is trying to call the `len()` function on a NoneType object, which is not allowed in Python. This happens because the `self.columns` parameter is set to `None` in the test case `DummyS3CopyToTableKey(columns=None)`, causing the `if` condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to raise a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
This corrected version introduces a check for the `self.columns` parameter before using the `len()` function on it. Now, if `self.columns` is None, the code inside the `if` statement will not be executed, preventing the TypeError.

With this correction, the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass successfully.
