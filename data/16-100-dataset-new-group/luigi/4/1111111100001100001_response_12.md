The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect usage of the `copy_options` attribute. The variable `options` in the `cursor.execute` statement is assigned the value of `self.copy_options`, which is a function, not a value. This will cause a TypeError because the `cursor.execute` statement expects a string.

To fix this bug, `self.copy_options` should be called as a function to return the options string, and then it can be assigned to the `options` variable in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the function to get the options string

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the options string
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly call the `copy_options` function to retrieve the options string and use it in the `cursor.execute` statement.
