The potential error location in the buggy function is the "if len(self.columns) > 0" condition, where it is checking if the columns list is not empty. Since the test case is passing columns as None, this condition will not be satisfied and colnames will remain an empty string.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is not handling the case where the columns list is None, which causes the colnames variable to remain an empty string, leading to an incorrect SQL statement being executed.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check if self.columns is not None before constructing the colnames string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will handle the case where columns is None and construct the colnames string accordingly. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
