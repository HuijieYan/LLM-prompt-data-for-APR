The bug is caused by trying to determine the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` to be raised when trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` is used to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to determine its length. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue and the function should now pass the failing test.
