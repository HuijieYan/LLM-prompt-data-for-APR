The buggy function is failing because it expects self.columns to be a list, but when the columns are None, it causes a TypeError when trying to determine the length of NoneType.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if self.columns is None before checking its length. If it is None, we can set colnames to an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Add a check for NoneType
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check to ensure that self.columns is not None before attempting to determine its length. This change should fix the TypeError that was occurring when self.columns was None.
