The bug in the `copy` function is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0`. When `self.columns` is `None`, this comparison causes a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` as suggested in the GitHub issue. This change prevents the comparison from being executed when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the comparison `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` ensures that the length is only checked when `self.columns` is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring.
