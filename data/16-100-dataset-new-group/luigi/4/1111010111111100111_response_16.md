## The bug in the buggy function

The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is with this line of code:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The issue occurs when the `self.columns` parameter is `None`, causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` demonstrates this issue by providing `None` as the value for the `columns` parameter. The GitHub issue also confirms that providing `None` for the `columns` parameter causes the bug.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

The bug can be fixed by modifying the code to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to find its length. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this correction, the line `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before finding its length. This change ensures that the `TypeError` will not occur when `self.columns` is `None`.
