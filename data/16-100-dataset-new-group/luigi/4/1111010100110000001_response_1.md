The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to call `len` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns:` to confirm if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string. Otherwise, we proceed as before. This change should fix the bug and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
