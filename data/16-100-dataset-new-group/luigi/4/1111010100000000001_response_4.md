The potential error in the `copy` function is the incorrect use of string formatting in the `cursor.execute` statement, which can lead to SQL syntax errors or incorrect queries being executed.

The `creds` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement is being formatted using the `self._credentials()` method, which may not be returning the credentials in the correct format for the SQL query.

Additionally, there is a possibility of SQL injection if the `source` parameter is not properly sanitized.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `self._credentials()` method returns the credentials in the correct format for the `CREDENTIALS` clause in the `COPY` statement.
2. Sanitize the `source` parameter to prevent SQL injection.
3. Use proper string formatting to construct the `COPY` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
     CREDENTIALS '%s'
     %s
     ;"""
    
    cursor.execute(copy_query, (f, self._credentials(), self.copy_options))
```
This corrected version uses parameterized queries to safely insert the file source and credentials into the `COPY` statement. It also prevents SQL injection by properly formatting the query and uses the `%s` parameter placeholders to provide the values.
