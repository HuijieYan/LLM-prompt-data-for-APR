## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )

```

Explanation:
1. The bug occurred because the original code did not check whether `self.columns` was not None before trying to access its length.
2. The error message "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" indicated that `self.columns` was being treated as a NoneType, leading to the error when trying to access its length.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the fix should involve checking if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. Therefore, the corrected version includes this check before accessing the length of `self.columns`.
4. The fix involves modifying the if statement to check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to check its length.
5. By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length is only accessed if `self.columns` is not None and is non-empty.

With this correction, the bug is fixed, and the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is None without causing a TypeError.
