The problem in the function `copy` of the `S3CopyToTable` class is that it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` properly. The function first tries to check the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to execute `len(None)`.

To fix this, we need to add a check for `None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we'll set `colnames` to an empty string. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
