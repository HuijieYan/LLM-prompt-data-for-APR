## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Fixed the bug here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This change addresses the issue of trying to get the length of a NoneType object and ensures that the code runs smoothly even when `self.columns` is None.

This change also aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, solving the problem and allowing the function to work as intended.
