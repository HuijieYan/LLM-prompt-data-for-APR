The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file. The bug causes a `TypeError` because it is trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`). The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, which then calls the `copy` method with `columns=None`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` function.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, before using `len(self.columns)`, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` to avoid the `TypeError`. This change will ensure that the `copy` function handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.
