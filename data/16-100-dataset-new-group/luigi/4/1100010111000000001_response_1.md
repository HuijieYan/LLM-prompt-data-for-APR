## Explanation
The bug in the original function is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a valid list, which leads to a potential AttributeError when `self.columns` is None. This inconsistency causes the test to fail when checking for the SQL query execution.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to check if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length. By doing so, we avoid the AttributeError and ensure that the `colnames` variable is correctly formatted.

The corrected version of the function includes the check for `self.columns` and only proceeds to create `colnames` when `self.columns` is not None.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test by correctly executing the SQL query when `self.columns` is None.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will work as intended and pass the failing test.
