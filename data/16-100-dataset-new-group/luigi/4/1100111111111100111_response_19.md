To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to address the issue related to the `columns` attribute being None, which is causing a `TypeError` when checking its length. Based on the GitHub issue, we should modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified condition
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, we handle the case when `self.columns` is None by first checking if it is not None before attempting to get its length. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the function to work as expected for the provided test case.
