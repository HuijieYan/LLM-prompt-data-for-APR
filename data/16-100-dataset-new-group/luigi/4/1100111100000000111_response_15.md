The bug in the provided function seems to be related to how it handles the `self.columns` attribute. Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that when `self.columns` is None, it is causing a TypeError when trying to determine the length of it. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. We should check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to determine its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This change checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to determine its length, which should address the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub thread.
