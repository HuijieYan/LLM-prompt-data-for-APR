The bug in the `copy` function is causing Redshift COPY jobs to fail in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided.

Potential error location:
- The line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is causing the bug because it is not handling the case when `self.columns` is None.

Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by the lack of handling when `self.columns` is None, resulting in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `copy` function now includes a check for `self.columns` before checking its length, preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
