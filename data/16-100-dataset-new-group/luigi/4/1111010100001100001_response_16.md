The bug in the provided function `copy` is that the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string and then used in the SQL query without considering the case when `self.columns` is empty.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is empty, which leads to an empty `colnames` variable being used in the SQL query, causing an error.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is empty and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns` to determine if it is empty or not, and only then construct the `colnames` string. This will ensure that the SQL query is constructed correctly, regardless of whether `self.columns` is empty or not.
