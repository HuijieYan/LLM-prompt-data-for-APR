The potential errors in the `copy` function are as follows:

1. The use of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` is incorrect. It seems that `_credentials` and `copy_options` are meant to be called as methods of the class, but they are being treated as if they are attributes.

2. The `self.copy_options` should be a method call rather than a reference to the method.

3. The `self._credentials()` is also likely to be intended as a method call.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect referencing of the `_credentials` and `copy_options` methods within the `copy` function. The functions are intended to be called, but the code attempts to reference them without calling.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should be modified as follows:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `_credentials` and `copy_options` are both called as methods by adding parentheses after their names. This will ensure that they are executed within the context of the class and are not treated as attributes.
