The bug in the `copy` function is causing a TypeError to be raised when the function is called. The bug appears to be because the `self.columns` attribute is `None` and the code does not handle this case. To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function to handle the `None` case:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns is not None` before checking the length of `self.columns`.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `copy` function handles the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
