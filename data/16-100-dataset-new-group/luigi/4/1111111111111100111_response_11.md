To fix the bug in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class, we need to address the issue where the `columns` attribute is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. The fix involves adding a check for `None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` to conditionally construct `colnames` only when `self.columns` is not `None`. We also changed `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to call the `copy_options` method.

By making these changes, the `TypeError` caused by `self.columns` being `None` will be resolved, and the buggy function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
