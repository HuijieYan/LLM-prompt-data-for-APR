## The bug analysis
The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the `columns` attribute is `None` and the code is trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. This error is consistent with the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" where the root cause is identified as a code change in a previous version.

## Identified potential error location
The potential error is located at the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a non-empty list. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code fails because it cannot get the length of a `NoneType` object.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

## The corrected version
Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code will only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
