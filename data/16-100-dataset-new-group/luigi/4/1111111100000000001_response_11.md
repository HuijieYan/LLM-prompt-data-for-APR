To fix the buggy function, we need to focus on the `cursor.execute` block and make sure that the string formatting is correct for all the variables being passed into the SQL query.

The potential errors in the buggy function are in the string formatting for `colnames`, `creds`, and `options`.

The cause of the bug is that the string formatting is not done correctly for the variables being passed into the SQL query. The `colnames` variable should be formatted as a comma-separated string enclosed in parentheses, while the `creds` and `options` variables should be functions that need to be called instead of being passed as-is.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly format the `colnames` variable, call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions, and provide their return values to the `cursor.execute` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have formatted the `colnames` variable correctly, and we have called the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions to provide their return values to the `cursor.execute` method. This should fix the bug in the function.
