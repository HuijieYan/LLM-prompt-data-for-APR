The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the use of the `self.copy_options` method, which is not being called correctly. The `copy_options` method is a member function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, but it is being used as an attribute without being called as a function.

To fix this bug, the `self.copy_options` should be called as a function by using `self.copy_options()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` as a function, the bug in the `copy` function should be resolved.
