The bug in the `copy` function is that it is not calling the `self.copy_options()` method to get the actual copy options for the SQL statement. Instead, it is directly passing the method reference `self.copy_options` as a string to the SQL statement.

To fix this bug, the `copy` function should call the `self.copy_options()` method and pass its result to the SQL statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options method to get the actual options
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options)  # Use the actual options obtained from copy_options
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will now call the `self.copy_options()` method and use its result as the `options` in the SQL statement. This should fix the bug and make the function work as intended.
