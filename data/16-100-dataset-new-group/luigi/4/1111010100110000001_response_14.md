The error message indicates a TypeError within the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line, which is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, but it is of type 'NoneType'.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is None before attempting to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for NoneType before getting the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This should fix the TypeError caused by trying to get the length of a NoneType object.
