The cause of the bug is that the `self.columns` attribute is initially set to `None`, and the buggy function does not handle this case properly, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the buggy function to check if the `self.columns` attribute is not None before getting its length.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def _credentials(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def copy_options(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the function now properly checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, fixing the `TypeError` issue.

This should address the problem reported in the GitHub issue and resolve the failing test.
