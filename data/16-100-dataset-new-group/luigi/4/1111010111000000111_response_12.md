The potential error location within the buggy function is the following line of code:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is None, it is not possible to call `len()` on it, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the `len()` call should be wrapped in a check for `self.columns` being not None.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `self.columns is not None` check, we ensure that the `len()` call is only made when `self.columns` is not None, preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None. This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
