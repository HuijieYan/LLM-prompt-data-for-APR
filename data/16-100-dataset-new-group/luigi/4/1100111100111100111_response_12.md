To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to address the TypeError caused by trying to get the length of a NoneType object. This occurs when the 'columns' attribute of the 'self' object is None. We will modify the if condition to check if 'columns' is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check for self.columns before trying to get its length, which will prevent the TypeError when 'columns' is None.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post and should resolve the failing test.
