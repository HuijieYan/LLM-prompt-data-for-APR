The bug in the `copy` function arises from the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where the code attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it exists or is not None.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the `copy` function with the `columns` parameter set to `None`, which results in an error because the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to take the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` exists and is not None before trying to retrieve its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and` condition before checking the length, we ensure that the code will not attempt to take the length of `self.columns` if it is `None`, thereby avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring.

This corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
