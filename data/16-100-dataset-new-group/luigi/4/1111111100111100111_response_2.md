## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is caused by checking the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not None. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function first checks if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is None.

By incorporating this fix, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
