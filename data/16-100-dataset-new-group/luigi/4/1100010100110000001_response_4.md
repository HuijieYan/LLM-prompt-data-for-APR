The buggy function `copy` is failing due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. This error occurs at `if len(self.columns) > 0:`

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added an additional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that we only access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and the function should now pass the failing test.
