The buggy function is `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The purpose of this function is to perform a "COPY" operation from an S3 source to a Redshift table.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None` and then runs the task. This task calls the `copy` method, which fails because it tries to get the length of `self.columns` when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` method. We can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length. If it is `None`, then we should use an empty string for `colnames` to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this correction, the `copy` method will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`. This will allow the failed test to pass.
