The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the Redshift luigi package is causing a Type error when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`. This bug was reported in a GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".

The cause of the bug is that the function is not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length with `len(self.columns)`. The GitHub issue also suggests a potential solution by changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should be modified to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. Additionally, if `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable should be set to an empty string to avoid any issues with concatenating string values.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the TypeError from occurring. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
