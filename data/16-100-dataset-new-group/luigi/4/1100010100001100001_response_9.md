The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string, which is then used without considering the case when it's empty in the `COPY` command. This causes an issue when trying to execute the `COPY` command without any column names.

To fix the bug, we should check if `colnames` is empty and only include it in the `COPY` command if it's not empty.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_command = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)

    if colnames:  # only include colnames if it's not empty
        copy_command = copy_command.replace('COPY', 'COPY {colnames}'.format(colnames=colnames), 1)

    cursor.execute(copy_command)
```

With this correction, the function will only include the `colnames` in the `COPY` command if it's not empty, thus fixing the bug.
