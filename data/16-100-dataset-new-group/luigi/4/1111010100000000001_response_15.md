The potential errors in the `copy` function are:
1. The `logger` object is used without being defined or imported.
2. The `colnames` variable is being used without being defined.
3. The `copy_options` attribute is being used without being defined.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to use variables or attributes that are not defined within the function or the class.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to:
1. Define or import the `logger` object.
2. Define the `colnames` variable.
3. Define the `copy_options` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import logging  # Import the logging module

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (class definition remains the same) ...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Define the logger object
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        colnames = ''  # Define the colnames variable
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        copy_options = ''  # Define the copy_options attribute
        
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=copy_options)
        )
```
