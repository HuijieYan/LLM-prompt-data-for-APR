## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the original function is that it is missing the closing parenthesis in the `cursor.execute` call. As a result, the SQL query is not formatted correctly, and this will cause a syntax error when the query is executed.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by adding a closing parenthesis at the end of the `cursor.execute` call to properly close the `format` function.

The corrected version includes the added closing parenthesis, which fixes the bug in the original function.
