The bug in the provided function is due to the condition `len(self.columns) > 0` which throws a TypeError when `self.columns` is None. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the bug occurs specifically when `columns` are not provided, resulting in a TypeError during the Redshift COPY job.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, which will ensure that the code only attempts to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the code will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length, addressing the issue reported on GitHub and resolving the bug.
