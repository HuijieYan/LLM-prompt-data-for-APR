The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` fails when `self.columns` is `None`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` also confirms this issue.

The root cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function attempts to call `len` on it, which results in a `TypeError` as `NoneType` has no length.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With the above fix, the `copy` function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post and will make the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` pass.
