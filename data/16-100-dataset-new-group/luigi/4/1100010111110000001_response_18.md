The buggy function is the `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is expecting a `columns` attribute to be available, and if it's a non-empty list, it's trying to extract the column names to include in the `COPY` SQL statement.

In the failing test, `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` is created with `columns` set to `None`. When the `run` method is called on this instance, it's trying to execute the `copy` method, which in turn tries to get the length of `self.columns` and fails with a `TypeError` because `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` method. We can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and if it's not `None`, then proceed with constructing the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before applying the `len` function to it. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.

By implementing this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test successfully.
