The buggy function `copy` has a bug related to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. This error occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is `None` and the buggy function tries to check its length using the `len` function.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function does not handle this case and directly tries to check the length, resulting in the `TypeError`. This bug was reported in a GitHub issue, where it was mentioned that the buggy function should explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking the length. 

To fix the bug, the buggy function should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before performing the length check. If `self.columns` is `None`, the length check should be avoided to prevent the `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` is added to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
