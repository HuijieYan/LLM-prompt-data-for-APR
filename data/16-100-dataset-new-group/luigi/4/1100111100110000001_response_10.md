The bug in the given function is that it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is None properly. The error message indicates that the `len` function cannot be applied to a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If it is None, we will handle it appropriately, such as assigning an empty list to `colnames`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, thus avoiding the TypeError.
