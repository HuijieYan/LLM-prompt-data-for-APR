The root cause of the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is that it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the `copy` function with `columns=None`, which leads to the error message:
```
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
```

This bug has been identified and reported in a GitHub issue with the title "Redshift COPY fails in Luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The issue suggests a possible solution to change the line in the code where the error occurs to handle the case of `self.columns` being `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition in the `copy` function to check for `None` before calling `len` on `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should handle it accordingly to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to retrieve its length, thus avoiding the `TypeError` when `columns=None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
