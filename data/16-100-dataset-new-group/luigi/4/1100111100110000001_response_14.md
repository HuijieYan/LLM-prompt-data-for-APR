The bug in the given code is that the `self.columns` attribute is not being properly handled before checking its length, which causes a `TypeError` when it's `None`.

To fix this bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we can handle it differently to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    credentials = self._credentials()
    options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,
        options=options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check for `self.columns` to ensure it's not `None` before trying to get its length, thereby avoiding the `TypeError` that was previously occurring. We have also stored the results of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` in separate variables before using them in the `cursor.execute` statement, which is best practice and might help avoid potential bugs related to those functions in the future.
