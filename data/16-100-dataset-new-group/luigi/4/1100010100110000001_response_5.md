The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of the `self.columns`. This suggests that `self.columns` is of type `NoneType`, meaning that it does not contain any data.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring by checking for None before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is None:  # Check if self.columns is None
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, before trying to get the length of `self.columns`, we first check if it is `None`. If it is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string. If it is not `None`, we proceed with building the `colnames` string as before. This ensures that the code will not trigger a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
