The bug in the `copy` function is that it's not properly formatting the `colnames` and `options` in the `cursor.execute` method. Additionally, it should be using triple quotes for the multi-line SQL command to avoid formatting issues.

The `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string if `self.columns` is not provided. However, it's not handling the case when columns are not provided, resulting in an empty `colnames` being inserted into the SQL command.

The `options` variable is not being used properly in the SQL command. It should be included only if it is not an empty string, and it should be properly formatted.

Also, the use of triple quotes for the multi-line SQL command will ensure that the string formatting is done correctly.

To fix the bug, we should update the `copy` function to handle the cases when `self.columns` and `self.copy_options` are not provided, and use triple quotes for the multi-line SQL command.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_options = ''
    if self.copy_options:
        copy_options = self.copy_options

    cursor.execute(f"""
     COPY {self.table} {colnames} from '{f}'
     CREDENTIALS '{self._credentials()}'
     {copy_options}
     ;
    """)
```
