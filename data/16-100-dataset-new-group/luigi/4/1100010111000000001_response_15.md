The bug in the `copy` function arises from the fact that the `colnames` section of the SQL query is not being handled properly when `self.columns` is empty. This results in a mismatch between the expected SQL query in the test function and the actual query generated in the `copy` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` section is either included or excluded appropriately based on the presence or absence of columns. 

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns: # check if self.columns is not empty
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,  # include colnames section only if it's not empty
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` section will be included in the SQL query only if `self.columns` is not empty.

This corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test.
