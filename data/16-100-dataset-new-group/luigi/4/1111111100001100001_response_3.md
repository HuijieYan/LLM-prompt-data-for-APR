The buggy function is the `copy` method inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. This method is responsible for copying data from an S3 source into Redshift.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. The usage of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` within the `cursor.execute` call.
2. The construction of the `COPY` SQL command might be incorrect, leading to a failed execution.

The cause of the bug is that the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are not being called correctly, resulting in incorrect arguments being passed to the `cursor.execute` method. Additionally, the use of `colnames` appears to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are called correctly to retrieve the necessary credentials and options for the `COPY` command. Additionally, the construction of the `COPY` SQL command needs to be validated and corrected if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    credentials = self._credentials()
    options = self.copy_options()
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,
        options=options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have explicitly called `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` to retrieve the necessary credentials and options, and used those values in the `cursor.execute` method. Additionally, we have added a check for `self.columns` to properly construct the `colnames` variable.
