The bug in the given function is likely due to the incorrect construction of the SQL query in the cursor.execute() method. The formatting of the query string using the .format() method may not be correctly substituting the values of table, colnames, source, creds, and options into the query.

To fix the bug, consider using parameterized queries instead of formatting the query string manually. This will ensure that the values are substituted correctly and help prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function using parameterized queries:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
    COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
    CREDENTIALS %s
    {options}
    ;""".format(table=self.table, colnames=colnames, options=self.copy_options)

    creds = self._credentials()

    cursor.execute(query, (f, creds))
```

In this corrected version, the query string is constructed using placeholders (%s) for the values that will be substituted later via cursor.execute(). This approach prevents SQL injection and ensures that the values are correctly substituted into the query.

By making this change, the bug in the original function should be fixed, and the function should behave as intended.
