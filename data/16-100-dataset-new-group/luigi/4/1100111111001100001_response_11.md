The buggy function `copy` is not correctly formatting the `COPY` SQL statement. It is not correctly passing the `colnames` and `options` values into the statement, which is causing the failing test.

The `colnames` variable is being formatted correctly in the buggy function, but it is not being passed into the `COPY` statement in the `cursor.execute` call.

Additionally, the `copy_options` variable is not being called as a function in the `cursor.execute` call. It should be `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options`.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `colnames` variable is correctly passed into the `COPY` statement, and that `self.copy_options` is called as a function.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()))
```

In this corrected version, we are passing the formatted `colnames` variable into the `COPY` statement, and we are calling `self.copy_options()` as a function. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
