The error is occurring because the `columns` attribute is `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, causing a `TypeError` when the `copy` function tries to use `len()` on it. To fix this, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before performing any operation on it.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # added condition to check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and the test should pass without raising a `TypeError`.
