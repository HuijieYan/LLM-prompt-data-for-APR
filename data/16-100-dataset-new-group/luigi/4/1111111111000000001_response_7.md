The main issue in the `copy` function is that it's trying to call `self.copy_options` as a function, when it should be invoked to get the value. Also, the placeholders like `{table}`, `{colnames}`, `{source}`, `{creds}`, and `{options}` are not being interpolated correctly.

The `copy_options` function should also be invoked to return the options string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

After correcting the function, it should no longer error and should pass the failing test.
