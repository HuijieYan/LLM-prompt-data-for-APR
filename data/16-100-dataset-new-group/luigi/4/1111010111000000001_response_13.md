The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`. The issue lies in the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition, where `self.columns` is assumed to be a list of columns, but when it's `None`, the buggy function does not handle it correctly.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function attempts to iterate over it, resulting in a `NoneType` object error. This occurs because the buggy function assumes that `self.columns` is always a list, but it doesn't handle the case when it's `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to iterate over it. If it's `None`, we should handle it appropriately by not trying to construct the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to iterate over it, avoiding the `NoneType` object error, and passes the failing test.
