## Fixed version of the buggy function


```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
- The bug was caused by checking the length of `self.columns` without first ensuring that it's not None. This resulted in a TypeError when `self.columns` was None.
- By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we prevent the TypeError and only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not None.
- This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub post by correctly handling the case when `self.columns` is None.

By making this change, the function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is None and pass the failing test.
