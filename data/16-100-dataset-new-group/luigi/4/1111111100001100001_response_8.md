It seems that the buggy function `copy` is failing because it is not correctly formatting the SQL query string and it may not be handling the `copy_options` correctly.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `copy_options` function returns a string that can be included in the SQL query. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `creds` parameter in the SQL query is a string, and that the `options` parameter is also a string.

Here's a corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have added parentheses to call the `copy_options` function and ensure that it returns a string, and we have also modified the formatting of the `CREDENTIALS` and `options` parameters to ensure that they are correctly handled as strings in the SQL query.
