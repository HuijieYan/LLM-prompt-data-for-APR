The bug in the 'copy' function of the 'S3CopyToTable' class in the 'luigi/contrib/redshift.py' file is causing a TypeError when 'columns' is None. The issue has been reported on GitHub and the suggested solution is to change the line to "if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0".

To fix the bug, we can update the 'copy' function to check if 'self.columns' exists and has a length greater than 0 before attempting to use it.

Here's the corrected version of the 'copy' function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this version, we added a check for the existence of 'self.columns' and its length before using it. This change will prevent the TypeError when 'columns' is None, as reported in the GitHub issue, and the function will work as expected.
