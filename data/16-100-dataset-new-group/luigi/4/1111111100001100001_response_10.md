The bug in the provided function is that the `self.copy_options` variable is not being called as a function. It appears to be a method, but it is not being executed with parentheses `()`.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options` method and execute it to obtain the actual options string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added the line `options = self.copy_options()` to call the `copy_options` method and store the result in the `options` variable. Then, we replaced `self.copy_options` with `options` in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Now, when the `copy` function is called, it will correctly execute the `copy_options` method and use the resulting options string in the SQL query.
