## The bug:

The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The bug causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is set to None and the `copy` function tries to access its length.

The bug triggers the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `redshift_test.py` file with the error message:
```
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
```

The root cause seems to be related to a change made in the file `redshift.py` in the luigi library and is related to the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".

## Fix strategy:

The fix involves modifying the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is set to None. Checking for None explicitly before accessing the length of `self.columns` will resolve the TypeError.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
