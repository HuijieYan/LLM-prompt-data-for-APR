The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, specifically on line 338 where it tries to evaluate the length of `self.columns`. This suggests that `self.columns` is of type `None` and is causing the error.

The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute for the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is being set to `None`, which triggers the error when the `copy` method tries to access the length of `self.columns`. The strategy for fixing this bug is to ensure that `self.columns` is always set to a valid list, even if it's empty.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None and has length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a check is added to verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, preventing the `TypeError` caused due to `NoneType` object. With this change, the function should now operate correctly and pass the failing test.
