The buggy function `copy` from the class `S3CopyToTable` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` has a bug related to handling the columns attribute, which is resulting in a TypeError because it is checking the length of a NoneType object. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the file `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is trying to test this buggy function and is raising a TypeError because it is passing `columns=None` when creating a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object and then calling the `run` method, which in turn calls the `copy` method.

The cause of the bug lies in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class, specifically in the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line tries to check the length of `self.columns`, which is resulting in a `TypeError` because `self.columns` is `None`. The test is intentionally passing `columns=None` to test this behavior and it is indeed exposing the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, then we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly. Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added an additional check to see if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to find its length. We also made sure to call the `self.copy_options()` method correctly when formatting the SQL query string.

With this corrected version, the `copy` method should no longer raise a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, and the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass without any errors.
