The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class seems to be failing when `self.columns` is set to `None`. This causes an error when trying to calculate the length of `self.columns`. 

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` sets the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance to `None`. When the `copy` function is called, it tries to use `self.columns` to construct the `colnames` variable, which results in an error when trying to calculate the length of `None`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition for constructing `colnames` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to construct `colnames` based on its contents.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before using it, we can avoid the TypeError when it is `None`. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
