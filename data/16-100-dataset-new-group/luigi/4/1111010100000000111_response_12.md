The bug in the `copy` function is causing issues when `self.columns` is set to None, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. This bug has been raised as a GitHub issue, and the suggested solution is to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. We can also incorporate the suggested solution from the GitHub issue to prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None, preventing the `TypeError`. This aligns with the suggested solution from the GitHub issue.
