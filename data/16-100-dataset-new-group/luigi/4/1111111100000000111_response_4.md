## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original code occurs when trying to access the length of self.columns without checking if it exists. This causes a TypeError when self.columns is None. The GitHub issue explains that when columns are not provided, the Redshift COPY job fails with an error.

The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to check if self.columns exists before checking its length to prevent the error. The corrected version of the function includes this check to ensure that the length of self.columns is only accessed if it exists.

By incorporating this change, we ensure that the code will not attempt to access the length of self.columns if it is None, thereby resolving the bug.
