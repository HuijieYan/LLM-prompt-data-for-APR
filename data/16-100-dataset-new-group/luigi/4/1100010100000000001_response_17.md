## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

## Explanation:
The buggy function has a potential error with the formatting of the SQL query inside the `cursor.execute` method. The formatting of the string may cause syntax errors in the SQL query due to missing or mismatched placeholders.

## Bug:
The bug in the original code is the incorrect formatting of the SQL query inside the `cursor.execute` method, which can lead to syntax errors.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the placeholders in the SQL query are formatted correctly to avoid syntax errors.

The corrected version of the function has the SQL query properly formatted and the placeholders enclosed in curly braces `{}` to ensure the correct substitution of values.

By making this change, the bug in the original function should be fixed.
