## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates that the `TypeError` occurs when trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`. The GitHub issue also provides information on the root cause of the bug and a proposed fix.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations are:
1. Line 338: `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where the length of `self.columns` is being accessed directly without checking for `None`.
2. Line 338: `colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])` where `self.columns` is used without checking if it's `None`.
3. Line 350: `options=self.copy_options` where the `copy_options` method is called without the parentheses, potentially leading to a different type of error related to method call.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the code is directly accessing the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get its length throws a `TypeError`.

Additionally, the method `copy_options` is being accessed as a property without using parentheses for a method call. This will not work as intended.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. Also, ensure that `copy_options` is called as a method with parentheses. We can follow the proposed solution in the GitHub issue to address these issues.

## Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()))  # Call copy_options as a method with parentheses
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. And when calling `copy_options`, we use parentheses to ensure it's called as a method. This should address the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
