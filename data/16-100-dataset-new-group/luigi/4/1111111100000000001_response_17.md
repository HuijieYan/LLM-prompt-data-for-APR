The bug in the provided function is that the `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function. It should be `self.copy_options()`.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

The bug was causing the `copy_options` to be treated as a variable reference rather than a function call, resulting in a TypeError. By adding the parentheses to `self.copy_options()`, we are correctly calling the `copy_options` function.
