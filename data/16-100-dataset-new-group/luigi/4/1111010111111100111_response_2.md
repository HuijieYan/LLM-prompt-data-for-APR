The root cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case when self.columns is None. This causes the TypeError when trying to check the length of NoneType. 

To fix the bug, we should update the buggy function to first check if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length. If it's not None, then we can proceed with getting the column names.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This should fix the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub. Now the function will first check if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length, resolving the TypeError.
