The bug in the provided function is likely due to the incorrect use of the `_credentials()` and `copy_options` functions, as well as some missing formatting in the `cursor.execute` statement.

The `_credentials()` function seems to be a method of the `_CredentialsMixin` class, which is not defined in the provided code. Therefore, it is essential to check if this method is correctly implemented or if it is causing the bug.

Similarly, the `copy_options` function is not defined within the `S3CopyToTable` class or the `_CredentialsMixin` class. It is essential to verify if this function should be present, and if it needs to be called differently.

In the `cursor.execute` statement, the `options=self.copy_options` part is likely trying to call the `copy_options` method, but it is missing the function call parentheses. This means that `self.copy_options` is being passed as a string, rather than the result of a function call.

To fix the bug, the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` function calls should be properly implemented and called. Additionally, the missing parentheses in `self.copy_options` should be added to correctly call the function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` functions are correctly called with parentheses, and the necessary changes have been made to ensure the cursor.execute statement is formatted correctly.
