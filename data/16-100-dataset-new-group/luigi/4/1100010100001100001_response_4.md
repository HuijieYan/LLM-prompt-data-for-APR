The bug in the function is that the colnames variable is being set to an empty string before building the SQL query, which may result in an extra comma at the beginning of the column names list.
Since the colnames variable is empty, the resulting SQL query may contain an extra comma at the beginning of the column names list, leading to a syntax error.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the colnames variable is empty before including it in the SQL query.
We can achieve this by adding a conditional check to include the colnames variable only if it is not empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query_template = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;"""
    
    if colnames:
        query = query_template.format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options
        )
    else:
        query = query_template.format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames='',
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options
        )

    cursor.execute(query)
```

By implementing this fix, we ensure that the colnames variable is only included in the SQL query if it is not empty, preventing any extra commas in the column names list and fixing the bug.
