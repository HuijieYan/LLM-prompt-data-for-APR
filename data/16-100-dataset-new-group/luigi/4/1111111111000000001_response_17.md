The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `colnames` variable being set to an empty string, and then the `colnames` being passed to the `COPY` SQL statement whether or not there are actual column names. This results in an incorrect SQL statement being executed.

To fix the bug, you should check if `self.columns` is empty, and only include the `colnames` in the `COPY` SQL statement if there are actual column names to be copied.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:  # Check if self.columns is not empty
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` will only be included in the `COPY` SQL statement if there are actual column names to copy, and the test should pass as expected.
