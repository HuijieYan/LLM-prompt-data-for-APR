The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect usage of the `self.copy_options` variable. 

The `self.copy_options` variable is being used as a function without calling it. However, based on the function definition provided, `copy_options` is a method, not a variable, so it should be called as a method with parentheses `self.copy_options()`.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method and pass the result to the `{options}` placeholder in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()  # call the method
    )
)
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` method will be called and its result will be used in the `cursor.execute` statement, fixing the bug that caused the function to fail.
