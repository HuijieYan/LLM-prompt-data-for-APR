Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, it seems that the bug is related to the length check of the columns. The failing test specifically mentions that when `columns=None`, it is expected to prohibit table creation, but instead, it causes a TypeError due to the length check on `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, the length check on `self.columns` should be modified to handle the case when `columns` is None. The fix should ensure that the length is only checked when `self.columns` is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    # Fix the length check to handle the case when columns is None
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the length check on `self.columns` now includes the check for `self.columns` being not None. This should resolve the bug described in the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass.
