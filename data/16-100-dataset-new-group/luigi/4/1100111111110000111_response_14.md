## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to the error "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()". This is because the function attempts to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not `None`.

To fix this, the corrected version of the function includes a check for `self.columns` before getting its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then its length is obtained and used in the subsequent logic. This prevents the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.

By addressing this issue, the corrected function resolves the bug and will pass the failing test. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, which also recommends checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.
