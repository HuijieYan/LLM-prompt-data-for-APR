The buggy function `copy` has a few potential error locations:
1. The `colnames` variable is not properly constructed and used in the `cursor.execute` call.
2. The `creds` variable is not being properly populated from the `_credentials` function.
3. The `options` variable is not being properly populated from the `copy_options` function.

The cause of the bug is that the variables `colnames`, `creds`, and `options` are not being correctly populated with the expected values from the related functions `_credentials` and `copy_options`. This is leading to an incorrect SQL query being executed by the `cursor.execute` call.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames`, `creds`, and `options` variables are properly constructed from the related functions. The correct values need to be passed into the SQL query in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    credentials = self._credentials()
    copy_options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,
        options=copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have properly constructed the `colnames`, `credentials`, and `copy_options` variables before the `cursor.execute` call. This ensures that the correct values are used in the SQL query, fixing the bug in the function.
