The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the `self.columns` attribute is `None`. This causes the `colnames` variable to remain empty, resulting in an incorrect SQL query being generated when the `cursor.execute` function is called.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable. If it is `None`, we will set `colnames` to an empty string, otherwise, we will construct it as per the existing implementation.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test provided.
