The bug in the `copy` function is due to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error, which occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.

### Bug explanation
In the buggy function `copy`, the `colnames` variable is being constructed by joining the elements of `self.columns` with a comma. However, when `self.columns` is `None`, it causes a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this correction, we have added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to construct the `colnames` variable. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
