The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to an attempt to get the length of `self.columns`, which is of type `None`. This error occurs when trying to format the `colnames` variable.

To fix this bug, the `colnames` variable should be checked for `None` before attempting to get its length. If it is not `None`, then the length can be calculated and used to format the string.

Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added a check for `self.columns` being not `None` before attempting to calculate the length. This ensures that the `colnames` variable is only populated and formatted when `self.columns` is not `None`, which should fix the `TypeError` mentioned in the error message.
