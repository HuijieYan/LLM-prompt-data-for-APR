## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `if len(self.columns) > 0:` statement assumes that `self.columns` is not None, which causes an error when `self.columns` is None.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is None.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
Modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to check its length, thereby preventing the TypeError and fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
