The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which can be `None` resulting in a `TypeError`.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the function tries to check the length of `None` which is not allowed, causing the `TypeError`. This is also confirmed by the information from the GitHub issue.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This way, it first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to check its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length, which will resolve the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
