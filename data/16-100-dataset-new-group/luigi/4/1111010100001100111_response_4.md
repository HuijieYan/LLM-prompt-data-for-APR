The bug in the code is causing a TypeError when columns are not provided. The bug is related to the len() function being called on the self.columns attribute without first checking if it is None.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to first check if self.columns is not None before calling len(self.columns).

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the code first checks if self.columns is not None before calling len(self.columns), which will prevent the TypeError when columns are not provided. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
