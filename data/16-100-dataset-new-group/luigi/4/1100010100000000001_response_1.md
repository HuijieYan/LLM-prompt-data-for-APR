Potential errors in the provided function include:
1. The use of string formatting for the SQL query could result in formatting errors.
2. There is a possibility of a syntax error in the SQL query itself.

The cause of the bug is that the SQL query is being constructed using string formatting, which can lead to syntax errors or improperly formatted SQL.

To fix the bug, the suggested strategy is to use parameterized queries instead of string formatting to construct the SQL query. This will make the code more robust and prevent SQL injection attacks.

Here's the corrected version of the function using parameterized queries:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
     CREDENTIALS %s
     %s
     ;""".format(table=self.table, colnames=colnames)
     
    cursor.execute(query, (f, self._credentials(), self.copy_options))
```
