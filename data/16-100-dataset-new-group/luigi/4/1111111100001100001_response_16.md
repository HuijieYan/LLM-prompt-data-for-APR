The bug in the `copy` function is due to the incorrect usage of the `copy_options` method and the `self._credentials()` method. The `copy_options` method is a class method, so it should be called using `self.copy_options()`, and the `_credentials` method is an instance method, so it should be called using `self._credentials()`.

Additionally, the `options` variable is not being properly formatted in the `cursor.execute` statement. It needs to be called as a method (`self.copy_options()`) and the format string should include `{}` for the options.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With these changes, the `copy` function should now correctly format the SQL query and call the `copy_options` method.
