The bug in the provided function is that it tries to calculate the length of a NoneType object in the following line:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The error message indicates a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(), which means that self.columns is of type None and cannot be evaluated for length.

To fix this bug, we need to include a check for None before trying to calculate the length. If self.columns is None, we can set colnames to an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Add a check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will check if self.columns is None before trying to calculate its length, preventing the TypeError.
