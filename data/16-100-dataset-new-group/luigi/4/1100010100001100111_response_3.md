The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the use of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` or not. The GitHub issue also indicates that the bug occurs when `columns` are not provided.

To fix this bug:
- We need to modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
- We also need to handle the case when `colnames` is an empty string to avoid issues when constructing the SQL query.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
