The potential error in the `copy` function seems to be in the way the `colnames` variable is being handled when assigning it to the `cursor.execute` statement. It looks like the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is being used to determine whether there are any columns to add to the `COPY` statement, but when `columns` is `None`, it doesn't account for that case.

The cause of the bug is that when `columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable should also be set to `None` to avoid inserting an empty string into the `COPY` statement, causing a syntax error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `columns` is `None` and set `colnames` accordingly before constructing the `COPY` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = None

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames='' if colnames is None else colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check whether `self.columns` is `None`, and if so, we set `colnames` to `None`. Then, in the `cursor.execute` statement, we use the `colnames` variable directly, handling the `None` case properly. This should fix the bug.
