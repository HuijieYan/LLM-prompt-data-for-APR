## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to perform a Redshift `COPY` operation, but the issue is related to the handling of `None` columns. The failing test indicates that when `columns=None`, the function fails with a `TypeError`.

## Bugs
1. The `colnames` variable is not properly handled when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly.

## Cause of the Bug
The buggy function `copy` does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check for `None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`, and handle the case where it is `None`.
2. Ensure that the `copy_options` function is called correctly.

## The corrected version
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        else:
            colnames = ''

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In this corrected version, a check for `None` is added before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`, and the `copy_options` function is called using `self.copy_options()`. This should address the `TypeError` reported in the GitHub issue.
