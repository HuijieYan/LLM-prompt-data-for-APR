## Corrections:

1. The buggy function `copy` is not properly formatted for string interpolation, and the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly.
2. The `copy_options` function is not being called with `()` at the end, so it's not being properly executed.
3. The `copy` function is failing to properly populate the `creds` and `options` fields in the SQL statement due to incorrect calls to `_credentials()` and `copy_options` functions.
4. The bug can be fixed by calling `_credentials()` and `copy_options()` functions with `()` at the end to properly execute them and populate the `creds` and `options` fields in the SQL statement.

## Fixed Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # Call _credentials() function with ()
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call copy_options() function with ()
    )
```

With these changes, the `creds` and `options` fields will be populated correctly in the SQL statement, and the failing test should pass.
