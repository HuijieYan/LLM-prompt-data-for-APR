Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it does not have proper handling for the case when `self.columns` is None. This causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the corrected version of the function now checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is not None, then it proceeds to construct the `colnames` string using the columns. Otherwise, it sets `colnames` to an empty string.

This corrected version of the function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is None and will not cause the TypeError.

With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
