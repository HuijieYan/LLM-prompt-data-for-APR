The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `columns` attribute being `None` and not being properly handled in the code. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and the test will pass without raising a `TypeError`.
