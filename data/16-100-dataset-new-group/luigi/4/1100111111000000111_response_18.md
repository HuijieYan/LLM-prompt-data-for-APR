The bug in the `copy` function is related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` expects the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. However, the buggy function does not handle this case correctly as it assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list, leading to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `copy` function to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to use it. The modified function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to use it. This modification ensures that the function can handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, as expected by the failing test. The corrected version of the `copy` function should resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
