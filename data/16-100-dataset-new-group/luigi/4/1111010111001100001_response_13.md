The bug in the `copy` function is that it is not handling the case where the `columns` attribute is `None`. In the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, which causes the `colnames` variable to be an empty string. However, the `colnames` variable is then used in the `COPY` SQL statement, which causes the statement to be malformed.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `columns` attribute is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will properly handle the case where the `columns` attribute is `None` and construct the `colnames` variable accordingly. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
