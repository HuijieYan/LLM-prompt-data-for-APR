The buggy function is the "copy" method of the S3CopyToTable class in the redshift.py file. It is responsible for executing a SQL COPY command to copy data from an S3 bucket into a Redshift table. 

The bug appears to be in the way the "copy" method constructs the SQL COPY command. The "creds" parameter is using the _credentials() method, but the "options" parameter is using the copy_options attribute directly rather than calling the copy_options() method. This can result in incorrect SQL syntax and cause the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we should call the copy_options() method to properly construct the "options" parameter in the SQL COPY command.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options method
    )
```

With this correction, the test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns test case should pass successfully.
