The cause of the bug is the comparison of a 'NoneType' object with the length, which is not allowed. The error message indicates that the columns attribute is of type 'NoneType' and cannot be used with the len() function.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to check if the columns attribute is not None before applying the len() function to it. This can be done using a simple if statement to handle the case where the columns are not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    # Check if columns are provided before using len() function
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, an if statement is added to check if the columns attribute is not None before using the len() function. If the columns are provided, then the rest of the function proceeds as before. This should fix the bug and allow the function to handle the case where the columns attribute is None.
