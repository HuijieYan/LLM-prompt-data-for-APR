To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to use it. 

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is None, the buggy function attempts to access its length which results in a TypeError. This issue was reported on GitHub with a suggested solution to check if `self.columns` is not None before using it.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length, preventing the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

By making this change, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
