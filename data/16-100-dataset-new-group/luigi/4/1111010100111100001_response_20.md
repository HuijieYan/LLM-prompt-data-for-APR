The bug in the provided code is caused by the attribute `self.columns` being set to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when checking its length in the `copy` function.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the code will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, thus preventing the `TypeError` that was causing the test to fail.
