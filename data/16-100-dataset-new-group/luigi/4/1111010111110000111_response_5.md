The bug in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement, which attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `if` statement to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this corrected version, the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass without the TypeError and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
