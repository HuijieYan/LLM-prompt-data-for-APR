The bug in the provided function is related to the handling of the `columns` parameter. In the case provided, the `columns` parameter is None, causing the `colnames` variable to remain an empty string. However, when the `colnames` variable is used in the `COPY` statement, it results in incorrect SQL syntax.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case where the `columns` parameter is None and adjust the `COPY` statement accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function now checks if the `columns` parameter is not None before processing it. If it's None, the `colnames` variable will remain an empty string, and the `COPY` statement will be adjusted accordingly.

The corrected version of the function will pass the failing test provided.
