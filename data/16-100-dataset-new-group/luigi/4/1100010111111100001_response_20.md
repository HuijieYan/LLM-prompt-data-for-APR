The bug in the `copy` function is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is of type `None`. This comparison is causing a `TypeError` because `None` does not have a length property.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string, otherwise, we can proceed with getting the column names.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring before.
