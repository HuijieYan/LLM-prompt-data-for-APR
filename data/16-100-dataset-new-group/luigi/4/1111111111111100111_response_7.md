The bug in the `copy` function from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing a TypeError when `self.columns` is None. The problem arises from the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0`, where `self.columns` is None, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this issue, the conditional check should be modified to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that the `len` function is not called on None.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `len` function is only called if `self.columns` is not None, resolving the TypeError issue. This version addresses the problem reported in the GitHub issue and should pass the failing test.
