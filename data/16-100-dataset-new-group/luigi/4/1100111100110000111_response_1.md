The bug in the `copy` function is caused by attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying that `self.columns` is not None. This causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when `self.columns` is None.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `if` condition to first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to check its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first verify that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to check its length, thus avoiding the `TypeError` that was encountered before. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well.
