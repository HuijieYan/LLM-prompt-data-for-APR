The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to handle the case when `self.columns` is set to `None`. This is evident from the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, which triggers a TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.

The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This change will ensure that the condition is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`, thus avoiding the TypeError.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix applied here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without triggering a TypeError.
