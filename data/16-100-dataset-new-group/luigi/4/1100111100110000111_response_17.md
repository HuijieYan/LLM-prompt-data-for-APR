The bug in the code is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` which throws an error when `self.columns` is `None`. 

The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Corrected line to handle NoneType
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This corrected version of the code should resolve the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None` and it should pass the failing test.
