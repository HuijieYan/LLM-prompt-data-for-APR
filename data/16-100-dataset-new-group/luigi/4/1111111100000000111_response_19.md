The issue in the buggy function is related to the `if` condition checking the length of `self.columns`. The GitHub issue suggests that when `columns` is set to `None`, it causes a `TypeError` because the length of `None` cannot be determined. The suggested solution is to update the `if` condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to check for the existence of `self.columns` before checking its length.

To fix the bug, the `if` condition in the `copy` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` condition, we ensure that we only attempt to calculate the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`.
