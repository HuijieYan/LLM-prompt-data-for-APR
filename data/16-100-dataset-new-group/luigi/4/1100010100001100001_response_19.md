The potential error in the buggy function is the way the `colnames` variable is being calculated. It appears that the `colnames` variable is not being included in the `COPY` query when it should be.

The buggy function is failing to include the column names in the `COPY` query. This is because the `colnames` variable is being calculated, but it is not being used in the query.

To fix the bug, the `colnames` variable should be included in the `COPY` query.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
