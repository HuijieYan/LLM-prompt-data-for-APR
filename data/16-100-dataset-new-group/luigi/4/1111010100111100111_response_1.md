The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a `TypeError` when the `columns` attribute is `None`. The `copy` function attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without first confirming that it is not `None`.

To fix the bug, we should update the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this updated `copy` function, it should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the Redshift COPY jobs to run successfully.
