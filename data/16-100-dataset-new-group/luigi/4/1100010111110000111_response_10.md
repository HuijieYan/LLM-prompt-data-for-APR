## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixing the condition
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we are ensuring that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, which resolves the TypeError when `columns=None`.

This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue for the bug.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
