Based on the information provided, the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` test to fail. The issue is related to the handling of the `columns` attribute when it is set to `None`.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code still attempts to check the length of `self.columns`, which results in the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will now correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is set to `None` and will avoid the `TypeError` that was causing the test failure.

After making this change, the failing test should pass, and the GitHub issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" should be resolved.
