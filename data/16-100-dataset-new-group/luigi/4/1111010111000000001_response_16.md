The potential error in the buggy function `copy` is that it assumes `self.columns` will always be a non-empty list, which may not be the case. If `self.columns` is None, the code will raise an AttributeError when trying to access `self.columns` length.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `copy` doesn't handle the case when `self.columns` is None properly, leading to a potential AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is None before trying to access its length and construct `colnames`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the buggy function will handle the case when `self.columns` is None properly and execute the `COPY` statement without raising an AttributeError.
