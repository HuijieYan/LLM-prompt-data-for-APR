## Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` file. This function is used to copy data from s3 into Redshift. It seems that the issue is related to handling the `columns` parameter when it is set to `None`.

The GitHub issue suggests that there is a TypeError occurring when `columns` is set to `None`, and it proposes a potential solution by changing the line of code to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

## Potential error locations
- The line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` may throw a TypeError if `self.columns` is `None`.
- The way `colnames` is being constructed seems to be related to the issue.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `copy` function's inability to handle the case when `self.columns` is set to `None`. This results in a TypeError being raised.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to find its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring. Additionally, the construction of `colnames` needs to be adjusted to handle the case when `self.columns` is empty.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before constructing `colnames`. If it is None, then `colnames` is set to an empty string. This approach ensures that there won't be a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
