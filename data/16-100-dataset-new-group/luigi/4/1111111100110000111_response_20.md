## Explanation
The bug is caused by the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class. When `self.columns` is set to `None`, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` throws a TypeError because `NoneType` does not have a length.

## Fixing the Bug
We need to update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

## The Corrected Version
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
