## Analysis
The GitHub issue states that when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None to prohibit table creation, it fails with a TypeError. The issue identifies the root cause as a specific line of code in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.

## Error Locations
The potential error location in the buggy function is the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked. It seems that when `self.columns` is set to None, it causes a TypeError.

## Cause of the Bug
The buggy function failed to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This causes a TypeError when attempting to check the length of None.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the condition checking the length of `self.columns` needs to be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. By adding an extra check for `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, it ensures that the length is only checked when `self.columns` is not None.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified condition to handle None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the bug identified in the GitHub issue would be resolved, and the Redshift COPY operation should no longer fail when `self.columns` is set to None.
