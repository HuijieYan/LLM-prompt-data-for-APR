The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. 

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`. 

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is set to `None`, the code still tries to call the `len()` function on it, resulting in a `TypeError`. This is in line with the GitHub issue description, where it is mentioned that running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None to prohibit table creation fails due to the TypeError.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to check if `self.columns` is not None before calling `len()` on it.

Corrected version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
