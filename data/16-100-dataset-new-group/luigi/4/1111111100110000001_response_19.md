The bug in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a `TypeError` due to the comparison of `self.columns` (which is `None`) with an integer.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy` method does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and it tries to execute `len(self.columns)` regardless of its value, leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length and constructing the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` method will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to call `len(self.columns)`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
