The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is `None`, and the buggy function is trying to call `len()` on it which is causing a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we should check if `self.columns` is `None` before calling `len()` on it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    # Check if self.columns is not None before calling len()
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
In the corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before retrieving its length, and also call `self.copy_options()` with parentheses after it (since it's a method call).

This should fix the bug and the function should now pass the failing test.
