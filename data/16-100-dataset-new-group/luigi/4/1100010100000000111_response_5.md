## Analysis
The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None, resulting in a TypeError due to trying to get the length of a NoneType object. The issue also suggests a potential solution to change the conditional check for the length of self.columns.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is in the conditional check for the length of self.columns. If self.columns is None, the code will throw a TypeError when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the buggy function not handling the case where self.columns is None, leading to a TypeError when trying to retrieve the length of self.columns.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional check for the length of self.columns to specifically check if self.columns is not None before attempting to retrieve its length.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the conditional check for the length of self.columns is modified to ensure that self.columns is not None before attempting to retrieve its length. This change resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
