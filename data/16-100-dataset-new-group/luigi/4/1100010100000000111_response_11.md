## Analysis:
The GitHub issue mentions that when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation, it fails with a TypeError. The cause of the bug is identified in the luigi source code where it checks the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if `self.columns` is not None.

Potential Error Locations:
The `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition is prone to error when `self.columns` is None.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None. Therefore, when `self.columns` is None, attempting to get the length of None raises a TypeError.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
