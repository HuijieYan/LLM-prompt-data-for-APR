The bug in the `copy` function is causing a TypeError when trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is of type `NoneType`. This suggests that `self.columns` is set to `None` when it should be an empty list `[]` instead.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is always set to a list, even if it is empty. We can use a conditional assignment to achieve this.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns]) if self.columns else ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By using the conditional assignment `if self.columns else ''`, we make sure that `colnames` is set to `''` when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the TypeError.
