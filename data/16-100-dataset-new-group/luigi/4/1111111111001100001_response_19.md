The bug in the `copy` function seems to be that the `self.copy_options` variable is not being called as a function. Instead, it is being treated as a string, which is causing the `COPY` SQL statement to be constructed incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we should call the `copy_options` function and use its return value in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are calling the `self.copy_options()` function and using its return value in the `cursor.execute` call. This should fix the bug and make the test pass.
