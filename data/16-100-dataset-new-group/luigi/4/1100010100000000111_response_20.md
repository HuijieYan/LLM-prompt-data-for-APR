## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
- The buggy function was failing when the 'columns' parameter was set to None, leading to a TypeError.
- The GitHub issue indicated that the root cause was related to the code in the function. The suggestion was to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length.
- The corrected version of the function includes the suggested change, ensuring that the 'columns' parameter is not None before attempting to get its length. This fixes the bug and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
