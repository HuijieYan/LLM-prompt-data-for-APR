The bug in the `copy` function occurs because it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

The corrected version of the `copy` function is shown below:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.

After making this change, the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
