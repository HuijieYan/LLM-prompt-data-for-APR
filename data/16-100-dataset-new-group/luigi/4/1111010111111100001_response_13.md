The bug in the `copy` function is causing a TypeError because it is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, preventing the TypeError that caused the failing test.
