The bug in the `copy` function is that the `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function, but rather just referenced as an object. This is incorrect because `copy_options` is a method and should be called with parentheses.

To fix this bug, modify the `cursor.execute` block to call `copy_options` as a method:
```python
cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
)
```

By adding the parentheses after `self.copy_options`, we ensure that the `copy_options` method is executed and its return value is used in the SQL query.

After making this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function would be:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
