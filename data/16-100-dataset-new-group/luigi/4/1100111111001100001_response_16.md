The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `self.copy_options` variable not being called as a function. It appears to be a method, so it should be called with parentheses.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options` method and then call the function it returns in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_options = self.copy_options()  # Call the method to get the options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options)  # Call the function returned by copy_options
    )
```

By calling the `self.copy_options` method and then using the returned function in the `cursor.execute` statement, we ensure that the function is properly executed and fixes the bug.
