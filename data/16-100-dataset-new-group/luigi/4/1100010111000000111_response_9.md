The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is failing when the `columns` parameter is set to `None` and trying to get the length of it.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the behavior of the `RedshiftTarget` and is testing the behavior of the `copy` function. The test is failing because when the `columns` parameter is `None`, the function throws a `TypeError`.

The GitHub issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides a clear description of the issue. The issue is caused by the `copy` function trying to get the length of `self.columns` even when it is `None`. The suggested solution is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and avoid trying to get the length of it.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `copy` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass.
