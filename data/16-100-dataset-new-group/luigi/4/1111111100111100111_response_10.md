The buggy function `copy` is failing when the `self.columns` is `None`. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the object type `NoneType` has no length.

Based on the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be related to the conditional check for the length of `self.columns`. The suggestion is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` ensures that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length, preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
