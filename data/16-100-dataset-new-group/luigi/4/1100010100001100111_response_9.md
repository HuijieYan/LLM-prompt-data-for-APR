The potential error location in the buggy function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is checking the length of `self.columns` without considering the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the `len()` function throws a `TypeError` because it cannot calculate the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By modifying the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when it is not `None`, thus resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
