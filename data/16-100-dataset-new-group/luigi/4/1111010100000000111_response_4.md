There is a bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file in the Luigi library. The bug causes Redshift COPY jobs to fail when the `columns` attribute is not provided.

The bug is located in the `copy` function where it checks the length of the `columns` attribute without verifying if it exists first. This causes a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs to be modified to check if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will only attempt to access the length of `self.columns` if it exists, preventing the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`. This solution aligns with the GitHub issue's suggestion and should resolve the bug.
