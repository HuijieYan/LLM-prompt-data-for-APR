The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `self.columns` being `None`, which leads to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when trying to check the length of `self.columns`. The failing test (`test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`) also confirms this by passing `columns=None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before attempting to construct the `colnames` string. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None, resolving the issue.

With this fix, the `copy` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
