The cause of the bug is that the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, and the buggy function does not handle this case properly. When `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function is trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object, which raises a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` ensures that the `len()` function is only called if `self.columns` is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
