The potential error in the buggy function is in the `cursor.execute` call. It seems like `self.copy_options` is a method, which should be called with parentheses, but it's being treated as a property without calling it. This will result in passing the function object itself rather than the result of the function call.

The correct approach should be to call the `self.copy_options()` method instead of just using `self.copy_options`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()  # Call the method here
    )
)
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` with parentheses, the method will be executed and its return value will be used as the value for `{options}` in the SQL query. This will ensure that the correct options are passed to the `COPY` command when the `cursor.execute` is called.

This correction should resolve the bug and make the test case pass.
