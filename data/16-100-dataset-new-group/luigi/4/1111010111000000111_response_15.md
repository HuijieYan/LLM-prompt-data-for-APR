To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, we need to address the issue where the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. This causes the `colnames` variable to be set to an empty string, leading to the error when trying to calculate the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function.

The suggested fix from the GitHub issue mentions changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` as a possible solution. This would handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before calculating length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, we explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate its length, which resolves the issue where the function fails when `columns` is set to `None`. The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
