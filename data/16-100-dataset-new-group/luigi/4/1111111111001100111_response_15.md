The bug in the `copy` function is that it doesn't handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` correctly. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is not `None`, then proceed with the rest of the logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is not `None`, then we proceed with the rest of the logic using `self.columns`. We also corrected the call to `self.copy_options` by adding parentheses to invoke the method.

This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `copy` function handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` properly.
