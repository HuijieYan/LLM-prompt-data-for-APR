The error message indicates that the `copy` function is trying to compute the length of `self.columns`, which is resulting in a TypeError because `self.columns` is of type 'NoneType'. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. `if len(self.columns) > 0:` - this line is attempting to compute the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
2. `creds=self._credentials()` - calling the `_credentials` function without checking if it is returning the expected credentials.
3. `options=self.copy_options` - using `copy_options` without calling it as a function.

The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is not being correctly handled when it is `None`. This results in a TypeError when trying to compute its length. Additionally, the function is not calling `_credentials` and `copy_options` as functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to compute its length.
2. Ensure that `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` functions are called when retrieving credentials and options.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to compute its length. Then, we ensure that `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` are called as functions to retrieve the correct credentials and options.
