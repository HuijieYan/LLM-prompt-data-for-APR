## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version:
1. I added a check to verify if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This addresses the root cause of the bug where the code was trying to get the length of `None`, causing a `TypeError`.
2. I also corrected the function call `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to correctly call the method and retrieve the options.

This correction will address the bug and the failing test case, as well as resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
