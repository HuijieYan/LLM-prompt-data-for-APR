### Analysis:
The bug is located in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error is related to the `columns` attribute being `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to check its length. The related function `_credentials` and `copy_options` are being called within the `copy` function. 

The GitHub issue reports that the bug appears when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None`, which prohibits table creation and causes the failure.

### Potential error location:
The potential error is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly. When `self.columns` is `None`, it causes a `TypeError` when trying to check its length, leading to the failure.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `copy` function should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` and handle the case where `columns = None` as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
This corrected version adds a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it sets `colnames` to an empty string, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
