The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `copy` is not checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The issue on GitHub suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` as a possible solution.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs to first check if `self.columns` is not None before obtaining its length. If `self.columns` is not None and has a length greater than 0, then it can proceed with the rest of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to obtain its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the function to execute properly.
