```

Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is not being handled properly, and the `options` are not being called as functions.

In the failing test, the `columns` parameter is set to `None`, so the buggy function fails to handle this properly and does not construct the `colnames` variable correctly.

To fix this, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to use it to construct `colnames`. Additionally, we need to call `self.copy_options()` with parentheses to properly execute the function and get the options data.

The corrected version uses a conditional check for `self.columns` and calls `self.copy_options()` with parentheses to fix the bug.

These changes will ensure that the function handles `None` values correctly for `columns` and properly calls the `copy_options` function to get the options data.
