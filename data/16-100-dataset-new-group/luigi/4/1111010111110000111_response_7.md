The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line, where it tries to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not None. This causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is None without causing a TypeError.

This corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
