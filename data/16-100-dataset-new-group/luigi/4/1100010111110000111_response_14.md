## Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates that the buggy function fails when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, as it is not a valid operation on a `NoneType` object.

The GitHub issue confirms that the bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, and it suggests a potential solution to check `if self.columns` before checking its length.

## Bug Location:
The potential error lies in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying that it is not `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when the function is called with `columns=None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by first checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

## The Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I have added a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This fix will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, and the function should now work as intended.
