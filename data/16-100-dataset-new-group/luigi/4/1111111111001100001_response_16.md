The bug in the `copy` function seems to be that `self.copy_options` is being treated as a function rather than a variable, and it is not being called with parentheses. This is causing the `copy_options` string to be concatenated into the SQL query rather than being used as a function to retrieve the options.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options` function and use the return value as the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to retrieve the options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the retrieved options as the value for the options parameter
    )
```

By calling the `self.copy_options` function and using its return value as the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement, we ensure that the correct options are used for the SQL query. This should fix the bug and make the `copy` function work as intended.
