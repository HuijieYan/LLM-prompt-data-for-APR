The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the `columns` parameter is `None`. This causes the `colnames` variable to remain an empty string, which leads to an extra comma being included in the `COPY` statement.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` and handle it appropriately by setting `colnames` to an empty string if it is. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before building the `colnames` variable. If it's `None`, `colnames` is set to an empty string to avoid the extra comma in the `COPY` statement.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
