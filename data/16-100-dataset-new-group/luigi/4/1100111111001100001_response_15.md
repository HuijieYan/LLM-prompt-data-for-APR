The bug in the `copy` function is due to the `columns` parameter being `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance. This causes the `colnames` variable to be an empty string, which is not accounted for in the `COPY` statement. 

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `colnames` is empty and adjust the `COPY` statement accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_statement = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)

    # Handle the case where colnames is empty
    if not colnames:
        copy_statement = copy_statement.replace("{colnames} ", "")

    cursor.execute(copy_statement)
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing the `colnames` variable. Then, we adjust the `COPY` statement to handle the case where `colnames` is empty.

With this correction, the `COPY` statement will be properly formatted, and the failing test should pass.
