## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The purpose of this function is to define the process of copying data from s3 into Redshift. It constructs an SQL `COPY` statement and executes it on the database using the provided cursor.

The `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are called within the `copy` function to obtain credentials and copy options, respectively. These functions are defined in the same file but in different classes. The `copy` function constructs the SQL statement using these components.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns` set to `None`, indicating that there are no specified column names for the copy operation. The test then mocks the Redshift target and the connection cursor and expects that the `COPY` statement executed on the cursor matches the expected SQL string.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The use of `self.columns` to construct the `colnames` variable, assuming that `self.columns` is always defined.
2. The use of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` without validating if they are returning expected values.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the `colnames` variable is constructed without checking if `self.columns` is defined or not. This causes issues with the generation of the `COPY` statement. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with how the `options` are being retrieved from `self.copy_options`, and the `credentials` are obtained from `self._credentials()`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is `None`, do not include `colnames` in the `COPY` statement.
2. Verify that `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are returning the expected values, and handle cases where they might return `None` or invalid values.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    creds = self._credentials() or ''
    options = self.copy_options() or ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=creds,
        options=options)
    )
```
With the corrected version, the `colnames` variable is constructed only if `self.columns` is not `None`. The credentials and options are retrieved using `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` and are handled to ensure they are valid.
