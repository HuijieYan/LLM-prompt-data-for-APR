The potential error in the `copy` function is with the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` will also be `None`, which will cause a problem when trying to format the SQL query using `colnames`.

The cause of the bug is that the `colnames` variable is not being properly handled if `self.columns` is `None`, which causes the `None` value to be inserted into the SQL query, leading to a syntax error.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is `None` and handle it accordingly by setting `colnames` to an empty string if `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is `None` and handling it properly, the corrected version of the `copy` function should pass the failing test.
