In the buggy function `copy`, the bug is caused by the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` which occurs due to the usage of `len(self.columns)` when `self.columns` is `None`. The error message indicates that `self.columns` is of type 'NoneType' and is causing the issue.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to add a check to see if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to calculate its length, thus preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring.
