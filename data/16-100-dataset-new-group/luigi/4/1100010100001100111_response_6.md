The buggy function has a potential error in the if statement checking the length of the self.columns list. The buggy function is causing an error because it does not handle the case when self.columns is None, which results in a TypeError when trying to access the length of None.

The cause of the bug can be identified from the GitHub issue, which states that running Redshift COPY jobs with columns = None fails with a TypeError. The root cause is identified as a specific line of code which checks the length of self.columns without verifying if it is None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the if statement to explicitly check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for self.columns is not None before checking its length to avoid the TypeError.
