The potential error locations within the buggy function are the following:
1. The `colnames` variable is not being properly formatted or checked for NoneType, which could lead to issues when constructing the `COPY` statement.
2. The `cursor.execute` statement is not properly formatted and may not execute as expected due to incorrect formatting and the use of the `format` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `colnames` variable is not being properly checked for NoneType, and the `cursor.execute` statement may not be correctly formatted. This can lead to errors when trying to execute the `COPY` statement.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is properly checked for NoneType and formatted, and that the `cursor.execute` statement is correctly formatted.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With these changes, the `colnames` variable is properly checked for NoneType before formatting, and the `cursor.execute` statement is correctly formatted using the `.format` method. These changes should address the issues identified and ensure that the function works as expected.
