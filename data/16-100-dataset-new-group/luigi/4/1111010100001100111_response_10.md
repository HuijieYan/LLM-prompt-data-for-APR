The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function tries to calculate its length, which results in a TypeError. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, where it is mentioned that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` fails due to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not None before calculating its length. If it is None, we should set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to calculate its length. If it is None, we set `colnames` to an empty string, which should resolve the issue described in the GitHub ticket.
