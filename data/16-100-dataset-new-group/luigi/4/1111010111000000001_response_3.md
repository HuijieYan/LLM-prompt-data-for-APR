The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `colnames` string being empty when `self.columns` is None. This results in a malformed `COPY` statement when there are no column names provided.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before extracting column names
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to make sure `self.columns` is not None before trying to extract column names from it. If `self.columns` is None, the `colnames` string will remain empty, which is the expected behavior.

This corrected version of the `copy` function should address the bug and ensure that the `COPY` statement is generated correctly even when no column names are provided.
