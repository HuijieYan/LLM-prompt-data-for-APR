The buggy function `copy` is attempting to execute a SQL `COPY` command to copy data from S3 into Redshift. It seems to be using the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions to construct the `CREDENTIALS` and `options` parameters for the `COPY` command.

Looking at the `COPY` command construction, it seems that `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are being called without parenthesis, which suggests that they are being treated as functions rather than being called. This would result in the literal string representation of the functions being used in the `COPY` command, rather than their return values.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to explicitly call `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` to retrieve their return values and properly construct the `COPY` command.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    credentials = self._credentials()
    options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,
        options=options)
    )
```
In this corrected version, `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` are explicitly called and their return values are stored in the `credentials` and `options` variables. These variables are then used in the `COPY` command construction.
