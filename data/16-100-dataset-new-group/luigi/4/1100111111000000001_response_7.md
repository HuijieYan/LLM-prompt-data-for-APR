The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `copy` function where the `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy_options` function is not being called, it is just being referenced without being executed.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to call the `copy_options` function in the `copy` function and use the returned value in the `cursor.execute` statement.

The corrected version of the `copy` function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options)  # Use the returned value of copy_options here
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now correctly call the `copy_options` function and use its returned value in the `execute` statement, ensuring that the `copy_options` are executed as intended.
