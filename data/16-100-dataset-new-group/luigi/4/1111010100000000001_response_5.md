The potential error in the given function is that the `copy_options` attribute is not defined in the `S3CopyToTable` class, which will cause an AttributeError when trying to access it.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy_options` attribute is not defined in the `S3CopyToTable` class, but it is being used in the `copy` function. This will result in an AttributeError when trying to access an undefined attribute.

To fix the bug, the `copy_options` attribute should be added to the `S3CopyToTable` class and initialized with the appropriate default value or set through the constructor. Additionally, the logger object used in the `copy` function needs to be imported for the function to work correctly.

```python
import logging

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def __init__(self, copy_options=None, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.copy_options = copy_options

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `copy_options` attribute is defined in the class constructor `__init__` and is passed to the superclass constructor using `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`. Additionally, the logger object is imported and used for logging within the `copy` function.
