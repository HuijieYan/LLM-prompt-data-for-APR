The bug in the given function is that it is not calling the `copy_options` function correctly and is not handling the condition when `columns` are None which is causing the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function is not calling the `copy_options` function correctly and is not handling the condition when `columns` are None.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the call to the `copy_options` function and handle the condition when `columns` are None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check before concatenating `colnames` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. We have also changed `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to correctly call the `copy_options` function.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
