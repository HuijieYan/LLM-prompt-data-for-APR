The bug in the provided code is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a TypeError. The `self.columns` parameter is mistakenly set to `null` instead of `None`, and this is causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.columns` parameter is correctly set to `None` when it is not provided. We can do this by modifying the `__init__` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class to set `columns` to `None` if it is not provided during object initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, we avoid the TypeError issue caused by comparing the length of a `NoneType` object.
