The bug in the provided code is that the `copy_options` function is not being called to retrieve the options for the `COPY` command. The function `self.copy_options` should be called as a method to retrieve the options, but it is currently being used as a variable, which will not retrieve the actual options.

To fix the bug, we should call the `self.copy_options` function as a method and retrieve the options for the `COPY` command. We also need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is handled correctly, even if `self.columns` is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we are now calling the `self.copy_options` function as a method to retrieve the options for the `COPY` command. We also added a check for `self.columns` to ensure the `colnames` variable is handled correctly even if `self.columns` is empty.
