The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the `colnames` variable. The function is supposed to construct a column names string if there are columns specified, and then use it in the `COPY` SQL query. However, it seems that the construction of `colnames` is not being handled correctly.

The `colnames` variable is being constructed by joining the column names from `self.columns`, but it is not being checked if `self.columns` is actually present or not. This is causing the `colnames` variable to be an empty string, even when there are columns specified.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing the `colnames` variable. If there are columns present, then we can construct the `colnames` variable as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly construct the `colnames` variable based on the presence of columns in `self.columns`, and the bug should be fixed.
