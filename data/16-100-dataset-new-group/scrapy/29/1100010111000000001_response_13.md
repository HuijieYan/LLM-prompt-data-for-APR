The potential error in the `request_httprepr` function is that it assumes the request is always an HTTP request. However, in the failing test, the function is called with non-HTTP requests like "file://" and "ftp://". This causes the function to fail because it tries to construct an HTTP representation for non-HTTP requests.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the request uses the HTTP scheme before constructing the HTTP representation. If the request is not an HTTP request, it should handle it differently or raise an error.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:  # Check if the scheme is HTTP or HTTPS
        raise ValueError("Only HTTP(s) requests are supported")

    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s

```

With this correction, the function will raise a ValueError if it receives a non-HTTP request, which is consistent with the behavior expected in the failing test.
