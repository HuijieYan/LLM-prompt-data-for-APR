## Analysis of the buggy function

The buggy function `request_httprepr` is used to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. However, there are potential errors in the function that need to be fixed.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

1. `urlparse_cached(request)` may not return the expected result.
2. Incorrect concatenation of HTTP request components may result in a malformed request.
3. Incorrect handling of `request.headers` and `request.body`.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug using the buggy function

The potential cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the request components properly, such as the parsed URL, method, headers, and body. This can result in unexpected behavior when generating the raw HTTP representation of the request.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Ensure that the parsed URL, method, headers, and body are handled correctly and concatenated in the proper format.
2. Check for any potential edge cases where the request components may be missing or malformed.
3. Use built-in Python libraries and functions for parsing and manipulating URLs and HTTP requests to ensure correctness.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, the URL parsing uses `request.url` instead of `urlparse_cached(request)` and the handling of headers and the request body has been updated to ensure correct concatenation of the raw HTTP representation. Additionally, the `to_bytes` function is used to ensure that the components are encoded as bytes where necessary.
