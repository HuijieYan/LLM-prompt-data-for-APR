The bug in the provided function is that the hostname is not being assigned to the Host header correctly.

The bug occurs because the hostname is being retrieved from the `parsed` object, which is an instance of `ParseResult` and does not have a `hostname` attribute. Instead, the correct attribute is `netloc`.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line `b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` to `b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"` in the `request_httprepr` function. This way, the correct hostname will be included in the HTTP representation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
