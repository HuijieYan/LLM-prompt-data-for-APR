The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is due to passing a URL with a scheme other than HTTP or HTTPS to the function, causing the `parsed.hostname` to be `None`. This results in the `to_bytes` function receiving a `None` value, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to concatenate it with a byte string.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `request_httprepr` function to check if the scheme of the URL is HTTP or HTTPS before trying to extract the hostname. If the scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS, we can set the `parsed.hostname` to an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:
        parsed.hostname = ''
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the `request_httprepr` function should handle non-HTTP/HTTPS URLs gracefully and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
