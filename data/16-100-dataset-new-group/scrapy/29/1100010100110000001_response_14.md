The buggy function `request_httprepr` is attempting to convert the parsed hostname to bytes using the `to_bytes` function. However, the error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` since it's expecting a string, unicode, or bytes object.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value. Additionally, we should ensure that the `parsed` object is properly populated by using `urlparse_cached` to parse the request URL.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        hostname = parsed.hostname
    else:
        hostname = b'localhost'  # Provide a default value for hostname
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case where the `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value of `localhost`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring, and the function will work as expected for non-HTTP requests.
