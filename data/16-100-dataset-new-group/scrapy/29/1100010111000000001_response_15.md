The potential error location within the buggy function is likely related to the construction of the path and the handling of non-HTTP requests.

The cause of the bug is likely that the function `request_httprepr` does not handle non-HTTP requests properly. When the test function `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` is run with non-HTTP request URLs, the buggy function fails to handle them correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle non-HTTP requests properly and ensure that it does not fail when processing such requests.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:
        # handle non-HTTP requests by constructing a simple representation
        return to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.path) + b" HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + "\r\n\r\n"
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle non-HTTP requests properly without failing, and the failing test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` should pass.
