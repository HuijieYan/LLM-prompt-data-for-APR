The potential error in the buggy function is that it assumes the request is always an HTTP request, causing it to fail when a non-HTTP request is passed to it.

The cause of the bug is that the function 'request_httprepr' only generates raw HTTP representation for HTTP requests and does not handle non-HTTP requests such as 'file://' or 'ftp://' requests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'request_httprepr' function to handle non-HTTP requests by checking the request scheme and generating raw representation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        return b""  # Return empty bytes for non-HTTP requests
```

With this corrected version, the function will now check the scheme of the request and return an empty bytes object for non-HTTP requests. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
