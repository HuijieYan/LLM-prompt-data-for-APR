The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the `parsed.hostname` returning `None`. This is likely due to the fact that the hostname is not part of the `parsed` attribute when the scheme is not `http` or `https`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if the scheme is `http` or `https` before accessing the `parsed` attributes such as `hostname`.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
        host_header = b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    else:
        hostname = b''
        host_header = b''
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host_header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function should now handle non-http and non-https URLs correctly and pass the failing test.
