The buggy function is `request_httprepr`, which is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `path` variable may not be constructed correctly.
2. The `Host` header may not be included correctly.
3. Concatenating the `s` variable with the request body may cause an issue, especially if the body is empty.

The cause of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is not included in the `Host` header, and the `path` variable may not handle the case when `parsed.path` is empty correctly.

To fix the bug, we should construct the `Host` header correctly and handle the `path` variable when `parsed.path` is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = parsed.path
    if not path:
        path = '/'
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where `parsed.path` is empty by setting `path` to `'/'.` We also include the `parsed.hostname` in the `Host` header correctly. Lastly, we check if the request body is not empty before adding it to the `s` variable.
