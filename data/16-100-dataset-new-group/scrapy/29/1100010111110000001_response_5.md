## Analysis
The error occurs in the `request_httprepr` function, specifically when trying to concatenate the "Host" header with `parsed.hostname`, which is causing a `TypeError` because `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This triggers the `to_bytes` function, which is expecting a valid input and raises an error when it receives a `None` type.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` before attempting to concatenate it with the "Host" header. This can be achieved by checking if `parsed.hostname` exists and providing a default value if it does not.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected version of the function, the check `if parsed.hostname:` is added to ensure that only when `parsed.hostname` exists, it will be concatenated with the "Host" header, thus preventing the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
