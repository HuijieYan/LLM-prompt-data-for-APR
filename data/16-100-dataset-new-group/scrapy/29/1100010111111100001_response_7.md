The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that the `parsed.hostname` value is not being handled properly, leading to a `NoneType` error.

The bug is caused by the following factors:
1. The `parsed` variable is derived from the `urlparse_cached` function, and it's expected to have `hostname` attribute. However, in the case of non-HTTP URLs like `file://` or `ftp://`, the `hostname` attribute is not populated.
2. The code tries to use `parsed.hostname` without handling the case where it could be `None`.

To fix the bug, the code needs to explicitly handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a fallback value for the `Host` header in the HTTP representation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version of the function now explicitly checks if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before using it. If it is `None`, it uses `parsed.netloc` as a fallback value for the `Host` header in the HTTP representation.
