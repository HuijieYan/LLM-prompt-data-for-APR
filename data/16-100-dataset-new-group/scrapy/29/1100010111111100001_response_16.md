The bug is caused by the `parsed.hostname` variable being `None` when the scheme is not 'http' or 'https', which leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to convert it to bytes. To fix this, we need to handle cases where the scheme is not 'http' or 'https' and set `parsed.hostname` to an appropriate value for the 'Host' field in the HTTP representation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    if parsed.scheme in ('http', 'https'):
        host = parsed.hostname
    else:
        host = b""
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version handles non-'http' and 'https' schemes by setting the `host` variable to an empty byte string in those cases. This ensures that the 'Host' field in the HTTP representation is always set to a valid value. This should fix the `NoneType` error and make the function work correctly for all types of requests.
