The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is causing the failing test. The function seems to incorrectly construct the raw HTTP representation of the given request when the request is not an HTTP request.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function constructs the HTTP representation assuming that the scheme is 'http' or 'https', but it does not handle non-HTTP schemes like 'file' or 'ftp', resulting in incorrect HTTP representations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests correctly. We can update the function to check if the scheme is not equal to 'http' or 'https', and construct the HTTP representation accordingly for these non-HTTP requests.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"
        return s
    else:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
```

By adding the check for the 'http' and 'https' schemes, we ensure that the function constructs the correct HTTP representation for different types of requests, including non-HTTP requests.

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass as the function will handle non-HTTP requests correctly.
