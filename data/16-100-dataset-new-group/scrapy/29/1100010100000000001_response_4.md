## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is designed to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could be causing the bug. 

1. The `urlparse_cached` function might not be correctly parsing the request.
2. The concatenation of the HTTP request (variable `s`) might be causing issues.
3. The handling of the request headers and body might be incorrect, leading to an invalid HTTP representation.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function appears to stem from the way the HTTP representation is being constructed. It's possible that the parsing of the URL, the construction of the HTTP headers, or the encoding of the request body is not being handled correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the URL parsing and the construction of the HTTP representation are done correctly. Additionally, we need to verify that the request headers and body are handled appropriately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for header, value in request.headers.items():
            s += to_bytes(header) + b": " + to_bytes(value) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In the corrected version, the request headers are iterated properly to be included in the HTTP representation, and the request body is added only if it exists. This should address the potential issues with the original function.
