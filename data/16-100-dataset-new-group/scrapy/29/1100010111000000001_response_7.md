The potential error in the given buggy function is that it assumes the request is always a HTTP request, leading to a failure when attempting to process non-HTTP requests, such as file or FTP requests.

The cause of the bug is that the `request_httprepr` function does not handle non-HTTP request types properly, as it assumes the request is always a HTTP request and tries to construct a HTTP representation without considering other protocols such as file or FTP.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully, and for non-HTTP requests, the function should return a representation indicating the specific protocol being used.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    scheme = urlparse_cached(request).scheme
    if scheme not in {'http', 'https'}:
        return to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(request.url) + b"\r\n"
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With the corrected `request_httprepr` function, the representation of non-HTTP requests will be handled properly by simply returning the method and URL without attempting to construct a specific HTTP representation.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and handle non-HTTP requests gracefully.
