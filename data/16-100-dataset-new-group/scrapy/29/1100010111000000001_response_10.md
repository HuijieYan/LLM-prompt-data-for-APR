The issue with the buggy function `request_httprepr` seems to be that it assumes the request is an HTTP request, and it constructs the raw HTTP representation based on that assumption. When a non-HTTP request is provided, such as a file or FTP request, the function fails.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully, without making assumptions about the type of request.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:  # Check if the request is not HTTP
        path = parsed.path or '/'
    else:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to see if the request scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS, and set the path accordingly. This change allows the function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
