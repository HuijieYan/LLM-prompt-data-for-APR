The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the incorrect construction of the `s` variable, which is the raw HTTP representation of the given request. The issue arises from the incorrect handling of the hostname in the `parsed` variable. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to correctly handle the hostname and construct the `s` variable with the correct HTTP representation.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or b'') + b"\r\n"
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host_header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the hostname in the HTTP representation and pass the failing test.
