### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object, causing a `TypeError`.

### Potential error locations:
The `parsed.hostname` attribute of the `parsed` object is likely causing the issue, as it's returning `None`.

### Cause of the bug:
The `parsed.hostname` attribute is `None` when the input URL is not an HTTP request, which causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` when trying to convert `None` to bytes.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
A strategy to fix the bug would be to check if the `parsed.hostname` attribute is `None` before using it, and handle this case appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    host = b''
    if parsed.hostname:
        host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
