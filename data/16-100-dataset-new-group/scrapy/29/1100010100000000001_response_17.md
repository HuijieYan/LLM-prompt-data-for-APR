```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function lies in the handling of the request headers. The `request.headers` object is not being properly converted to bytes using the `to_bytes` function, which may result in a TypeError when concatenating with other byte strings.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the `request.headers.to_string()` and `request.body` need to be converted to bytes using the `to_bytes` function to ensure that all components of the HTTP representation are in bytes.

By adding `to_bytes` appropriately where necessary, the bug can be fixed to ensure that the function returns the correct raw HTTP representation of the given request.
