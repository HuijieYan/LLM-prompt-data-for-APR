## The buggy function analysis
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is designed to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of a given request. However, it is failing when a non-HTTP request is passed to it. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError in the `to_bytes` function, which is causing the failure. 

## Potential error locations
The error could potentially be occurring in the `to_bytes` function when it is called with a `None` value, leading to a `NoneType` error.

## Bug cause
The bug is likely being caused by the input `parsed.hostname` being `None`, which then gets passed to the `to_bytes` function. The `to_bytes` function does not handle `None` values properly, leading to the TypeError.

## Bug fix strategy
The bug can be fixed by checking for the presence of `parsed.hostname` before using it in the `to_bytes` function. If it is `None`, a default value can be used or it can be converted to an empty string to avoid the TypeError.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, the presence of `parsed.hostname` is checked before using it in the `to_bytes` function to avoid the `NoneType` error.
