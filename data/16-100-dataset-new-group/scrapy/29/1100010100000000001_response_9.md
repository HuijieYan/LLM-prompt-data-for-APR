## Analysis of the buggy function

The `request_httprepr` function takes a request object and returns the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. The function first parses the URL of the request, then constructs the HTTP header and body based on the request object attributes.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The `urlparse_cached` function might not be handling the URL properly.
2. The construction of the HTTP header might not be handling all cases correctly.
3. The `request.body` might not be encoded properly if it contains non-ASCII characters.

## Cause of the bug

The bug is likely caused by one or more of the potential error locations listed above. It can result in incorrect HTTP representation of the request object, leading to issues when the request is sent.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Ensure that the URL parsing is done correctly using `urlparse_cached`.
2. Revise the construction of the HTTP header to handle all cases properly.
3. Ensure proper encoding of the request body.

## Corrected version of the function

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In this corrected version:
- We use `urlparse_cached(request.url)` instead of `urlparse_cached(request)` to parse the URL.
- We check if the `request.body` exists before adding it to the raw HTTP representation.
- We use `to_bytes` to encode the body and other string data properly.

By making these changes, we can ensure that the function correctly generates the raw HTTP representation of the request.
