The potential error in the `request_httprepr` function is likely to be related to the use of non-HTTP request URLs. This is evident from the failing test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request`, where the function fails to handle non-HTTP request URLs such as "file://" and "ftp://".

The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for non-HTTP protocols in the URLs, leading to the failure when processing non-HTTP requests.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle non-HTTP protocols by checking the URL scheme and conditionally processing the URL based on the scheme.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ["http", "https"]:
        # Handle non-HTTP/HTTPS requests
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.geturl()) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        return s
    else:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if the URL scheme is not "http" or "https". If it's not, we directly use the parsed URL as the HTTP representation.

This corrected version will pass the failing test as it now handles non-HTTP/HTTPS requests properly.
