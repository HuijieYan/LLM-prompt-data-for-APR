## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is intended to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request as bytes. The potential error locations are:
1. The `urlparse_cached` function may not return the expected parsed URL.
2. The `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions may not correctly encode the request method and path.

## Bug cause:
The bug in the function appears to be related to how the `urlparse_cached` function is used to parse the URL, as well as potential issues with encoding the request method and path.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `urlparse_cached` function is correctly parsing the URL and handle the case where the parsed path is empty.
2. Ensure that the encoding of the request method and path is done correctly using the `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
