The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is causing a TypeError to be raised when the `parsed.hostname` is None, since it attempts to concatenate it as bytes. This occurs when the input of the function is a non-HTTP URL.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is None, such as when the input URL scheme is not HTTP. One way to do this is to check if `parsed.hostname` is None, and if so, use an empty string instead.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    method = to_bytes(request.method)
    path_bytes = to_bytes(path)
    version = b"HTTP/1.1\r\n"

    host = b""
    if parsed.hostname:
        host = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"

    headers = b""
    if request.headers:
        headers = request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"

    final_body = b""
    if request.body:
        final_body = request.body

    return method + b" " + path_bytes + b" " + version + host + headers + b"\r\n" + final_body
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of `parsed.hostname` before trying to concatenate it with bytes. It sets `host` to an empty bytes object if `parsed.hostname` is None.

This correction should prevent the TypeError from occurring and ensure that the function produces the correct HTTP representation for both HTTP and non-HTTP URLs.
