## Analysis
The function `request_httprepr` takes a request object and prepares the raw HTTP representation of the request. The bug seems to be related to how the path is handled when constructing the HTTP representation.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The path variable is constructed using `urlunparse`, and it seems like there might be an issue with the parameters being provided to `urlunparse`.
2. The handling of the path, params, and query in the `urlunparse` function might be causing the bug.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the function is likely related to the way the path is constructed using the `urlunparse` function. It seems that the parameters used to construct the path may not be in the correct format, leading to an incorrect path being generated.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the parameters provided to `urlunparse` are in the correct format and that the path is constructed properly. Additionally, we should check the logic for handling params and query before constructing the path to ensure they are handled appropriately.

## Corrected Version
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    if parsed.params:
        path += ';' + parsed.params
    if parsed.query:
        path += '?' + parsed.query
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, I have updated the construction of the `path` variable to handle the `params` and `query` parameters correctly. Now, the `path` is constructed using the correct format and should resolve the bug.
