The buggy function is `request_httprepr`, which takes a `request` object as input and returns the raw HTTP representation as bytes.

The potential error locations in the code are as follows:
1. The `parsed` object is created using the `urlparse_cached` function, which might not be returning the correct values for the `hostname` and `path`.
2. The creation of the `path` variable might not be handling cases where `parsed.path` is empty or None properly.

The cause of the bug is that the `parsed.path` is not being properly handled when it is empty or None. This leads to an incorrect `path` variable being constructed and then used to create the `s` variable, resulting in incorrect raw HTTP representation.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.path` is empty or None by properly setting the `path` variable to `'/'` in such cases. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `parsed.hostname` is used in the correct place to construct the `Host` header.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)

    path = parsed.path or '/'
    hostname = parsed.hostname or ''
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
