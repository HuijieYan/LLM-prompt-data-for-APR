The bug in the function `request_httprepr` is causing a `TypeError` to be raised. The error occurs at the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object, leading to the `TypeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is not always guaranteed to have a value, resulting in it being `None` in some cases. This `None` value is then passed to the `to_bytes` function, which expects a valid string or bytes object, not a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before attempting to concatenate it with other strings. We can achieve this by adding a conditional check to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected version, a conditional check `if parsed.hostname:` has been added before concatenating `parsed.hostname` with the rest of the string. This check ensures that the `to_bytes` function is not called with a `None` value, fixing the `TypeError` issue.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
