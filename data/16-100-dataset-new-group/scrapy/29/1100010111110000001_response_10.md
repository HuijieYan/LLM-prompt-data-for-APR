The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is causing a `TypeError`. The bug occurs when the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, resulting in `to_bytes` function receiving a `NoneType` as input. This causes the `TypeError` because the `to_bytes` function expects a unicode, str, or bytes object.

To fix this bug, we can check if the `parsed.hostname` is None and handle this case appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `parsed.hostname` before using it. If `parsed.hostname` is not None, it will be included in the raw HTTP representation; otherwise, it will be omitted. This change prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function should now pass the failing test without raising a `TypeError`.
