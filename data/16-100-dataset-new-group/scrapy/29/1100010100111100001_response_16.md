The root cause of the bug is that `parsed.hostname` can be `None` for non-HTTP requests. This, in turn, causes the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` to fail since `to_bytes` expects a string object and not a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we can simply add a check for `parsed.hostname` to ensure it's not `None` before using it. If it is `None`, we can replace it with an empty string ''.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version adds a condition to check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before using it, and as a result, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases without any errors.
