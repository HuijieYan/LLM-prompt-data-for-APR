The error in the buggy function is occurring at the line:
```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```
The error message indicates that the 'parsed.hostname' value is None, and the to_bytes function is raising a TypeError because it cannot handle a NoneType.

To fix this bug, we should add a check for the presence of 'parsed.hostname' and handle the case where it is None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case where 'parsed.hostname' is None, preventing the TypeError from occurring. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
