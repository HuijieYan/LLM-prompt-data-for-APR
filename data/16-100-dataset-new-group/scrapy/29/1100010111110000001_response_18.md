The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` seems to be related to the `parsed` object, which is a result of parsing the input request. The error message indicates that the parsed object is None and the `to_bytes` function is raising a TypeError. 

The likely cause of the bug is that the given input requests "file:///tmp/foo.txt" and "ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt" are not standard HTTP requests, so when parsing them, the `parsed` object becomes None. This causes an error when trying to access the `hostname` attribute of a None object, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we can update the `request_httprepr` function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully and return an appropriate representation without causing any errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed is None or parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:
        # Return a generic representation for non-HTTP/HTTPS requests
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" / HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: localhost\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the parsed object is None or if the scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS. If so, we return a generic representation for non-HTTP/HTTPS requests. Otherwise, we proceed with the original logic to create the HTTP representation.

This corrected version of the function should now handle non-HTTP requests gracefully and pass the failing test without any errors.
