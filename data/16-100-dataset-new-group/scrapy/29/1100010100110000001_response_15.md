The bug in the given function is due to the `parsed.hostname` being `None` and causing an error when trying to convert it to bytes. Also, there is a potential bug with the `request.body` when it is `None`, causing a similar error when trying to concatenate it with the rest of the bytes.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the cases where `parsed.hostname` and `request.body` are None by providing default values for them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the cases where `parsed.hostname` and `request.body` are None, and the test should pass without any errors.
