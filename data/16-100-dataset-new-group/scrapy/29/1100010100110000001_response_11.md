The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it is trying to convert a `None` value to bytes without handling the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` because it expects a string or bytes object, but it's getting a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we should first check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to convert it to bytes and concatenate it with the `b"Host: "` string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Check if parsed.hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the function will now first check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to convert it to bytes and concatenate it with the `b"Host: "` string. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue when `parsed.hostname` is `None`.
