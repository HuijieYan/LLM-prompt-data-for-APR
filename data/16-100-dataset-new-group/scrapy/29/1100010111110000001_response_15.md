The issue here seems to be occurring due to the `parsed.hostname` being `None` when a non-HTTP request is passed to the `request_httprepr` function. This is causing an error when trying to convert it to bytes.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s += b"Host: " + b"localhost" + b"\r\n"  # Provide a default hostname
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the function will check if `parsed.hostname` is `None`, and if so, provide a default hostname of "localhost". This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
