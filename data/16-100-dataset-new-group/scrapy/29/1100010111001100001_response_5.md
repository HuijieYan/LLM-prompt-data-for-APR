The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it incorrectly constructs the path and HTTP representation for non-HTTP requests. The bug causes the HTTP representation to be incorrect, leading to failing tests.

The bug is due to the fact that the function always assumes the protocol to be HTTP and constructs the HTTP representation accordingly, irrespective of the actual protocol of the request. This results in incorrect representations for non-HTTP requests, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check the protocol of the request and construct the HTTP representation accordingly. If the request is not an HTTP request, the function should handle it appropriately, such as by using the correct protocol in the HTTP representation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        raise ValueError("Unsupported protocol for HTTP representation: %s" % parsed.scheme)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected version, the function checks the protocol of the request and raises a `ValueError` if the protocol is not HTTP or HTTPS. This ensures that the function does not construct incorrect HTTP representations for non-HTTP requests, fixing the bug.

The corrected version should pass the failing test for non-HTTP requests.
