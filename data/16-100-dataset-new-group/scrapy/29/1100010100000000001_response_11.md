## Analysis:
The function takes a request object and attempts to construct the raw HTTP representation of the given request. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could be causing the bug.

1. The `urlparse_cached` function might not be properly parsing the URL, leading to incorrect path and hostname values.
2. If the request object does not have a `headers` attribute, it will raise an AttributeError.
3. The concatenation of bytes and string might cause issues due to the improper encoding.

## Error Cause:
The bug in the function is likely caused by incorrect parsing of the URL, the potential absence of the `headers` attribute, and improper concatenation of bytes and strings.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the URL parsing is done correctly, handle the absence of the `headers` attribute gracefully, and use proper encoding when concatenating bytes and strings.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `request.url` instead of passing the entire `request` object to `urlparse_cached`.
- We check if `parsed.hostname` exists before adding the `Host` header.
- We handle the absence of the `headers` attribute in a conditional check.
- We use `to_bytes` to properly encode the request method, path, and body before concatenating with other bytes.
