The bug in the `request_httprepr` function seems to be related to the input URL format. The function is failing when the input URL is not an HTTP request.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes the request to be an HTTP request, and when it receives a non-HTTP request (e.g., file or FTP), it fails to handle it properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully. We can modify the function to check the scheme of the URL and handle different types of requests accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:
        raise ValueError("Only HTTP/HTTPS requests are supported")
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that the `parsed.scheme` is either 'http' or 'https'. If the scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS, we raise a `ValueError` to indicate that only HTTP/HTTPS requests are supported.

With this correction, the function should now handle non-HTTP requests gracefully and pass the failing test.
