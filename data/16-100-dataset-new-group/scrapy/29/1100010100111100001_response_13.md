The issue in the provided code is that the `parsed.hostname` attribute is used without ensuring that it is not `None`. This leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to convert it to bytes. 

To fix this bug, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before using it to avoid the `NoneType` error.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if parsed.hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding the check `if parsed.hostname`, we ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before using it, which resolves the `NoneType` error when trying to convert it to bytes. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
