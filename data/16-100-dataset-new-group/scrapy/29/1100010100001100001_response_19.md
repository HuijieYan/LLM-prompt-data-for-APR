The bug in the provided function is related to the way the `Host` header is constructed. When the parsed URL contains a non-empty `netloc` (e.g., `localhost`), the `Host` header should be set to the value of `netloc`. However, the current implementation uses `parsed.hostname` instead, which might result in an incorrect `Host` header.

To fix the bug, we need to update how the `Host` header is constructed. We will use the `netloc` value from the parsed URL if it is not empty, and fallback to `hostname` if `netloc` is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    netloc = parsed.netloc or parsed.hostname
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by using `parsed.netloc` if it's not empty, and falling back to `parsed.hostname` if `netloc` is empty. This ensures that the `Host` header is constructed correctly, based on the parsed URL.
