The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect usage of the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions, as well as the construction of the HTTP request string. The `urlparse_cached` function returns a `ParseResult` object, from which the `parsed.hostname` can be used to construct the "Host" header in the HTTP request. 

Additionally, the `urlunparse` function is used to construct the `path` variable for the HTTP request. 

The bug is caused by the incorrect construction of the `path` and `Host` header in the `s` variable.

To fix the bug, the correct usage of `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` should be employed to extract the correct values for constructing the HTTP request string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('http', parsed.netloc, parsed.path, '', '', ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
