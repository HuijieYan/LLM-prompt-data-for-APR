The bug in the code is that the parsed.hostname is not being used to construct the Host header in the HTTP representation. This results in an empty Host header in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to use the parsed.hostname value to construct the Host header.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    # Use parsed.hostname to construct the Host header
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"

    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected version, the Host header in the raw HTTP representation will now use the correct parsed.hostname value, which addresses the bug identified in the original function.
