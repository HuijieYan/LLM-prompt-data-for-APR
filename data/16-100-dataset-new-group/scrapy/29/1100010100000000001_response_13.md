Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The use of `urlparse_cached(request)` could result in a potential error.
2. The use of `request.body` without checking if it exists could lead to an error.
3. The use of `request.headers.to_string()` without checking if `request.headers` exists could also cause an error.

Explanation of the bug:
The potential bugs in the function include:
1. `urlparse_cached(request)` might not return the expected parsed result, leading to incorrect URL construction.
2. Accessing `request.body` or `request.headers.to_string()` without checking if they exist could lead to attribute errors.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add error handling to deal with cases where `request.body` or `request.headers` might not exist.
2. Consider using a safer method for constructing the URL, instead of relying solely on `urlparse_cached(request)`.

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    method = to_bytes(request.method)
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    
    headers = b""
    if request.headers:
        headers = request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    body = b""
    if request.body:
        body = request.body
    
    http_repr = method + b" " + path + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    http_repr += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    http_repr += headers
    http_repr += b"\r\n"
    http_repr += body
    
    return http_repr
