The bug in the provided function is that it assumes the request URL scheme is "http" and constructs the output accordingly. However, the bug fails to handle other schemes such as "file" or "ftp."

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle different URL schemes and construct the raw HTTP representation appropriately based on the scheme.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request."""
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme:
        netloc = parsed.netloc or request.headers.get(b'Host', b'')
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(netloc) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL scheme")
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the parsed URL has a scheme. If it does, we construct the raw HTTP representation based on the scheme and other components such as the path, headers, and body. If the URL does not have a scheme, we raise a ValueError to handle invalid URL schemes.

This should ensure that the function handles URLs with different schemes correctly and constructs the raw HTTP representation accordingly.
