The `TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType` error is occurring because the `parsed.hostname` value is None in some cases, causing the `to_bytes` function to fail when trying to convert it.

To fix this, we can handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is None and provide a default value. We can also improve the construction of the path in the `urlunparse` function to prevent a possible None value for the `parsed.path`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"  # Handle the case when parsed.hostname is None
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version handles the case when `parsed.hostname` is None by using an empty string as a default value. It also ensures that a valid value is used for the path construction in the `urlunparse` function to prevent a None value.
