The bug in the `request_httprepr` function seems to be related to the handling of non-HTTP requests. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message "to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType". This suggests that there might be an issue with handling the `parsed.hostname` variable, which was found to be `None` during the failing test.

The function seems to be assuming that `parsed.hostname` will always have a value, but this is not the case for non-HTTP requests. The `parsed.hostname` value will be `None` for non-HTTP requests, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to convert it to bytes.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None` for non-HTTP requests. We can use a default value or check for `None` before concatenating it with other strings.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding the check `if parsed.hostname is not None`, we ensure that we only concatenate the `parsed.hostname` value when it is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` when it is `None`.
