The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is causing a TypeError when the `parsed.hostname` variable is None. This happens when the request URL uses the file schema, as seen in the failing test case `request_httprepr(Request("file:///tmp/foo.txt"))`.

The issue stems from the fact that for non-HTTP requests, `parsed.hostname` can be None, and the function does not handle this case correctly. The `to_bytes` function does not handle None as a valid input.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None. We should check if the parsed URL has a hostname before attempting to concatenate it with the "Host: " string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if the URL has a hostname
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will check if the parsed URL has a hostname before attempting to concatenate it. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring in the original buggy function.
