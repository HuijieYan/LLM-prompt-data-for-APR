The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is causing a TypeError to be raised when trying to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes using the `to_bytes` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` attribute is sometimes `None`, and the `to_bytes` function does not handle `None` values.

To fix the bug, we should handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to convert it to bytes.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # handle the case when parsed.hostname is None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
