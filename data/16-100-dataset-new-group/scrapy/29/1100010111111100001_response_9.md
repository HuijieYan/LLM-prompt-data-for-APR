Based on the error message and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue occurs when trying to convert the `parsed.hostname` to bytes and concatenate it with `b"Host: "`. The `parsed.hostname` is not being properly handled when it's None, resulting in the TypeError raised by the `to_bytes` function.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None, ensuring that it's converted to an empty string before concatenating it with `b"Host: "`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Handle the case where parsed.hostname is None
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else ''
    
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This new version includes a line to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None, ensuring that it's converted to an empty string before concatenating it with `b"Host: "`. This should resolve the TypeError that was being raised in the failing test.
