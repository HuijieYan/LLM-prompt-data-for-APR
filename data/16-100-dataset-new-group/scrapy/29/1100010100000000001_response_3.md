## Buggy Function Analysis

The function `request_httprepr` is responsible for returning the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. It takes a `request` object as input and processes it to construct the HTTP representation. The bug seems to be related to the construction of the `path` variable and the handling of the `request.headers`.

## Potential Errors
- The `path` variable may not be constructed correctly.
- There might be an issue with handling the `request.headers` as it's added to the byte string concatenation.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by incorrect construction of the `path` variable and possible mishandling of the `request.headers`, resulting in an incorrect raw HTTP representation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correct the construction of the `path` variable using the `urlunparse` function.
2. Check the handling of `request.headers` to ensure it is correctly appended to the raw HTTP representation.

## Corrected Function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        headers_string = request.headers.to_string()
        s += to_bytes(headers_string) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In the corrected version:
- The `urlunparse` function is used to correctly construct the `path` variable.
- The `request.headers` are converted to a string before being added to the raw HTTP representation.
