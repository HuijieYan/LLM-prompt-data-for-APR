## Analysis
The `request_httprepr` function is meant to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. However, it seems to be failing when the request is not an HTTP request, as indicated by the failing test case. The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function, specifically when attempting to convert the `parsed.hostname` to bytes.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The `parsed` object might not have a `hostname` attribute when the request is not an HTTP request.
2. The `parsed` object might be `None` when the request is not an HTTP request.

## Bug Cause
The `TypeError` is occurring because the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` when it expects a valid string or bytes object. This happens because the `parsed.hostname` is `None` when the request is not an HTTP request.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by checking if `parsed` exists and has a `hostname` attribute before attempting to use it in the `request_httprepr` function. We can also provide a default value for the `parsed.path` when it is empty.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed:  # check if parsed exists
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"  # provide default value for parsed.hostname
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        return b""  # return an empty bytes object if parsed does not exist
```
