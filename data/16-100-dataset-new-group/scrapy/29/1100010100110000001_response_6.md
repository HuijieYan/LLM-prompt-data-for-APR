There are several potential error locations within the `request_httprepr` function:
1. The `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` may be causing the error message since `parsed.hostname` could be `None` for non-HTTP requests.
2. The `request.body` could be causing an error if it's `None`.
3. The `request.headers.to_string()` might be responsible if `request.headers` is `None`.

The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` instead of a unicode, str, or bytes object.

To fix the bug, we should check for `None` values in `parsed.hostname`, `request.body`, and `request.headers` and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, I added checks for `parsed.hostname`, `request.headers`, and `request.body` before using them. This should prevent the `NoneType` error that was occurring in the original buggy function.
