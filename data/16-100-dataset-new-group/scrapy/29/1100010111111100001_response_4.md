The bug in the buggy function `request_httprepr` causes a `TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType` error when called with a non-HTTP request, such as `Request("file:///tmp/foo.txt")` and `Request("ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt")`.

The bug occurs at the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. This line attempts to concatenate a byte string with the result of `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)`. 

The function `to_bytes` is raising the error because it expects a `str` or `bytes` object, but `parsed.hostname` is `None` when the protocol is not HTTP.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value or skip the `Host` header altogether if the request is not HTTP.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle non-HTTP requests and pass the failing tests.
