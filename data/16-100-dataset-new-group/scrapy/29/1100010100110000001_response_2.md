The bug in the function `request_httprepr` seems to be caused by the `parsed.hostname` returning `None`, which causes the `to_bytes` function to throw a `TypeError` when `hostname` is concatenated with `b"Host: "` due to it expecting a unicode, string, or bytes object, but receiving a `NoneType`.

To fix this, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    hostname = parsed.hostname or b"localhost"  # Provide a default value if parsed.hostname is None
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This correction adds a line to provide a default value of `b"localhost"` if `parsed.hostname` is `None`, thus preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
