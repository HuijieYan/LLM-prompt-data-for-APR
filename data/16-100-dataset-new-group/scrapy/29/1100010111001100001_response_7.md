The bug in the function `request_httprepr` is related to the incorrect generation of the HTTP representation for non-HTTP requests. In the provided test, the function fails to handle non-HTTP requests properly, resulting in incorrect representations.

The cause of this bug is due to the function always assuming the request to be an HTTP request and constructing the raw HTTP representation without considering the actual scheme of the request.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests differently and construct the raw representation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
    else:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n\r\n"

    return s
```

With this corrected function, the provided failing test should pass.
