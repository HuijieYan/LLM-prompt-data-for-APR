The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the `parsed.hostname` variable being `None`, which triggers a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function. This occurs when the input URL does not have a hostname, such as with the `file` and `ftp` schemes.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the `parsed.hostname` is `None` and set it to an empty string if it is. This will prevent the `to_bytes` function from throwing an error.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

Now, with this fix, the `request_httprepr` function should pass the failing test without triggering a `TypeError`.
