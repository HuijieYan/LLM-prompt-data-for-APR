The problem with the buggy function is that it assumes that the parsed URL will always have a hostname, which is not the case when dealing with non-HTTP URLs such as 'file' or 'ftp'. This leads to a NoneType error when trying to concatenate the 'Host' header.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the parsed URL does not have a hostname, such as when dealing with 'file' or 'ftp' URLs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we check if the parsed URL has a hostname before adding the 'Host' header to the raw HTTP representation. This change addresses the NoneType error that was occurring when dealing with non-HTTP URLs.
