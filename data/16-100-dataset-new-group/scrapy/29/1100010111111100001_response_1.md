The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the fact that the `parsed.hostname` attribute is sometimes `None`, which causes the `to_bytes` function to fail when attempting to convert it to bytes.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value in that scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else ''
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide the appropriate default value, allowing the `to_bytes` function to execute successfully. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
