The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't handle the case where the hostname is not present in the parsed URL. This causes the "Host" header to be empty, which is not valid in an HTTP request.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the parsed URL has a hostname and use it in the "Host" header if it's available. If it's not available, the function should handle this case gracefully by omitting the "Host" header.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the function will check if the parsed URL has a hostname and include it in the "Host" header if it exists. If the hostname is not present, the "Host" header will be omitted, preventing the bug identified in the test cases.
