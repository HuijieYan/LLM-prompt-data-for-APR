## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Checking if hostname is present
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body or b""  # Making sure there is a body, or assigning an empty byte string
    return s
```

Explanation of changes:
1. Added a check for `parsed.hostname` to ensure it exists before adding it to the raw HTTP representation.
2. Used `request.body or b""` to handle the case where `request.body` is `None`, ensuring it always has a value.

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
