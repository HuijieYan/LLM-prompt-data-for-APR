## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object where it should be receiving a unicode, str, or bytes object. This suggests that the `parsed.hostname` in the `request_httprepr` function is evaluating to `None`.

## Bug location
The bug is likely located in the `parsed = urlparse_cached(request)` line, where the `parsed` object is being created.

## Cause of the bug
The `parsed` object is attempting to parse a non-HTTP request (file:///tmp/foo.txt) using `urlparse_cached`, which is not able to extract a hostname from this type of request. This results in `parsed.hostname` being `None`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
Check if the parsed hostname is not `None` before attempting to use it in the HTTP representation, or provide a default hostname if it's `None`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    else:
        host = b"localhost"
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
