The potential error in the `request_httprepr` function is that it is assuming the request's URL scheme is always "http" and does not handle non-http schemes like "file" and "ftp" properly, leading to the failure of the test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle non-http schemes properly by checking the URL scheme and adjusting the output accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme in ('http', 'https'):
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported URL scheme: %s" % parsed.scheme)
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function will now properly handle non-http schemes and should pass the failing test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request`.
