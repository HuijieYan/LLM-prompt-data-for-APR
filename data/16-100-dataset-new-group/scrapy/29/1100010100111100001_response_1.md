The cause of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` value can be None, which leads to the `to_bytes` function throwing a `TypeError` when it tries to convert None to bytes.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` line to include a default value for `parsed.hostname` in case it is None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the function will check if `parsed.hostname` is not None before attempting to convert it to bytes, which will prevent the TypeError from occurring.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
