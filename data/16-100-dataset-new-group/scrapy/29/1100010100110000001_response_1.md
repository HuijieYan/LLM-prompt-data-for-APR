The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is None, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` because it is expecting a string but receiving a NoneType.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None and convert it to an empty string before concatenating it with the bytes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if `parsed.hostname` is not None before concatenating it with the bytes. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `parsed.hostname` is None.
