The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is causing a `TypeError` when the `request` parameter is not an HTTP request, causing the `parsed` variable to be `None` and then subsequently used in the `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` line, resulting in the `TypeError` from the `to_bytes` function.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the request is not an HTTP request, or it does not contain a valid URL.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ["http", "https"]:
        raise ValueError("The request is not an HTTP request")
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that the request is an HTTP request by verifying the scheme in the URL. If it's not an HTTP request, a `ValueError` will be raised. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring due to the use of `parsed` being `None` in the original buggy function.
