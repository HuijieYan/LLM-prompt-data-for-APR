## Analysis
The buggy function takes a request object and returns the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes. The potential error locations within the function include:
1. Parsing the URL - the `urlparse_cached` function might not be returning the correct parsed URL.
2. Constructing the path - the construction of the path using `urlunparse` might not be correct.
3. Encoding of strings - the encoding of strings to bytes using `to_bytes` might be incorrect.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by incorrect parsing of the URL and construction of the path. Additionally, the encoding of strings to bytes might not be handled properly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the URL parsing and path construction are correct. Additionally, we need to handle the encoding of strings to bytes properly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_unicode()) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
