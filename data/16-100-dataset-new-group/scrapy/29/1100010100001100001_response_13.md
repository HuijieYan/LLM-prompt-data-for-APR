The bug in the provided function is that it assumes the hostname is always present in the parsed URL, which may not be the case. This leads to the incorrect construction of the HTTP representation, specifically in the "Host" header.

To fix this bug, we should check if the `parsed.hostname` is an empty string and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if hostname is present
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `parsed.hostname` to ensure it's not an empty string before adding the "Host" header to the HTTP representation. This avoids the bug of incorrectly constructing the HTTP representation when the hostname is missing.
