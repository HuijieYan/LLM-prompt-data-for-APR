The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The use of `urlparse_cached` instead of `urlparse` for parsing the URL.
2. The possibility of `parsed.path` being None, which can cause an issue when constructing the path in the `urlunparse` function.
3. The use of `request.headers.to_string()` without checking if `request.headers` is None.

The cause of the bug is that the function uses `urlparse_cached` instead of `urlparse`, which may not parse the URL correctly. Additionally, if `parsed.path` is None, it can cause an issue when constructing the path in the `urlunparse` function. Lastly, if `request.headers` is None, the function will throw an error when trying to convert it to bytes.

To fix the bug, we should replace `urlparse_cached` with `urlparse` for proper URL parsing. We also need to check if `parsed.path` is None before constructing the path in the `urlunparse` function. Lastly, we should check if `request.headers` is None before attempting to convert it to bytes and append it to the raw HTTP representation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
