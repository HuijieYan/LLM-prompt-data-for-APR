The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is that the `parsed.hostname` value is being assumed to always exist, while it can be `None` in cases like `file` or `ftp` URLs.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and replace it with an empty string in the byte string representation of the HTTP request.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will check for the existence of `parsed.hostname` before including it in the byte string representation, preventing the TypeError caused by NoneType.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
