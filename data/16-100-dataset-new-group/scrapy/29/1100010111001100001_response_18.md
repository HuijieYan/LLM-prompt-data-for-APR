The cause of the bug is that the function request_httprepr is generating an incorrect HTTP representation for non-HTTP requests. This is due to the fact that it constructs the HTTP request line and Host header as if it were an HTTP request, without considering the actual scheme of the request. Additionally, it constructs the path and host using incorrect values for non-HTTP requests.

To fix the bug, we need to handle non-HTTP requests differently by constructing the request line, host header, and path based on the actual scheme of the request.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme in ('http', 'https'):
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        # For non-HTTP requests, only include the path in the request line
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"

    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version of the function checks the scheme of the request and constructs the request line, host header, and path accordingly. It also handles non-HTTP requests by including the path in the request line without the host header. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
