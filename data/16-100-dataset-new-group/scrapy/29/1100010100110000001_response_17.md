## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `unicode, str or bytes` object.

## Potential Error Location
The error is likely to be caused by the `parsed.hostname` variable being `None`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `parsed.hostname` variable being `None`, which results in the `to_bytes` function receiving the `NoneType` object and raising a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value in that case to prevent the `TypeError` from occurring in the `to_bytes` function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
