The error is due to the fact that the `hostname` attribute of the `parsed` object can be None, which causes an error when trying to convert it to bytes.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None and provide a default value for `Host`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname is not None else b"localhost"
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None by using a default value of `b"localhost"` for the `Host` header. This should resolve the TypeError that was occurring when `parsed.hostname` was None.
