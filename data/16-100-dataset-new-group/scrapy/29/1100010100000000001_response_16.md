## Analysis:
The function `request_httprepr` takes a request object as input and returns the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes. It uses various functions from the `scrapy` library to parse the request and construct the HTTP representation.

## Bugs:
1. `to_bytes(request.method)` and `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` may cause an error if `request.method` or `parsed.hostname` is not a string.
2. `request.headers.to_string()` may cause an error if `request.headers` is None.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that `request.method` and `parsed.hostname` are always strings, and that `request.headers` is always present.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `request.method` and `parsed.hostname` are valid strings before using the `to_bytes()` function on them.
2. Check if `request.headers` is not None before calling the `to_string()` method on it.

## Corrected version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    method_bytes = to_bytes(request.method) if request.method else b''
    hostname_bytes = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b''
    headers_bytes = request.headers.to_string() if request.headers else b''  # assuming headers is not None
    
    s = method_bytes + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + hostname_bytes + b"\r\n"
    s += headers_bytes + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body if request.body else b''  # assuming request.body is not None
    
    return s
