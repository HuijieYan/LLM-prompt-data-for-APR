The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it doesn't handle cases where the `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This causes the `to_bytes` function to receive a `None` value, resulting in a `TypeError` when it is expected to receive a unicode, str, or bytes object.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before using it in the `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` line of code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

Now, with this correction, the `request_httprepr` function should no longer raise a `TypeError` when `parsed.hostname` is `None`.
