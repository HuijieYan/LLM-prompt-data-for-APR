The buggy function has a few potential error locations. First, the `urlparse_cached` function might not be correctly parsing the request URL. Second, the `path` variable might not be properly constructed and third, the `Host` header might not be set correctly when using the FTP scheme.

The cause of the bug is that the `urlparse_cached` function is not correctly parsing the request URL. This is visible in the provided runtime values, where the netloc field is empty when it should contain the hostname. Additionally, the `path` variable is not correctly constructed.

To fix the bug, the `urlparse_cached` function can be replaced with the `urllib.parse.urlsplit` function to correctly parse the request URL. Then, the `path` variable can be constructed by checking for an empty path and substituting it with a forward slash. Lastly, the condition to set the Host header can be updated for more accurate handling under the FTP scheme.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlsplit

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlsplit(request.url)
    if not parsed.path:
        path = '/'
    else:
        path = parsed.path
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
In this corrected version, the `urlparse_cached` call is replaced with `urlsplit`, and the `path` is constructed correctly. Additionally, the condition to set the Host header is updated to handle the FTP scheme properly.
