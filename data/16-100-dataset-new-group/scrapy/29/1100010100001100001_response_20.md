The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case when the parsed URL does not have a hostname, which leads to the incorrect creation of the 'Host' header in the HTTP representation. This causes the function to fail when trying to perform the request for certain types of URLs.

To fix this bug, we need to edit the function to handle the case where the hostname is empty or missing in the parsed URL.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    # Check if the parsed URL has a hostname
    if parsed.hostname:
        host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        host_header = b""

    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host_header
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional check to determine whether the parsed URL has a hostname. If it does, the 'Host' header is added to the HTTP representation; otherwise, it is skipped.

This fix ensures that the 'Host' header will be properly handled for all types of URLs, resolving the bug that was causing the function to fail in certain cases.
