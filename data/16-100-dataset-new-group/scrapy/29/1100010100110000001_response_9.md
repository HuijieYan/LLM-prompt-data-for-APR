The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it's not handling the case where `parsed.hostname` could be `None`. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType` as input, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before concatenating it with other bytes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version includes a check for `parsed.hostname` to avoid the `NoneType` error. Running the failing test with this corrected function should pass.
