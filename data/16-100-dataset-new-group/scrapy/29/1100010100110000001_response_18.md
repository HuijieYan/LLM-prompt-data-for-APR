The buggy function is `request_httprepr`. The error message indicates that the `parsed` variable in the `request_httprepr` function is returning `NoneType`, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to fail since it's not receiving a valid input. This is likely due to an issue with the parsing of the request URL.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `parsed` variable is not `None` and contains valid URL components before using it to construct the raw HTTP representation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request."""
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we've replaced `urlparse_cached(request)` with `urlparse_cached(request.url)` to ensure that the correct URL components are extracted from the request. Additionally, we've used `to_bytes(request.body)` to ensure that the request body is converted to bytes before appending it to the raw HTTP representation.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
