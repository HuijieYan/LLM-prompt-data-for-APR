The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. The use of `urlparse_cached` function, as it may not return the expected output.
2. The use of `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions, as they may not handle the input properly and may cause encoding issues.
3. The concatenation of the HTTP request components, as it may not result in a valid HTTP request format.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the `urlparse_cached` function might not be returning the expected parsed URL components, `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions may not be handling the input properly and might cause encoding issues, and the concatenation of the request components may not result in a valid HTTP request format.

The strategy for fixing the bug would include using a different method to parse the URL components, ensuring correct encoding of the input, and building the HTTP request in a proper format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    s = (request.method + " " + path + " HTTP/1.1\r\n").encode('utf-8')
    s += "Host: ".encode('utf-8') + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + "\r\n".encode('utf-8')
    if request.headers:
        s += (request.headers.to_string() + "\r\n").encode('utf-8')
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module is used to parse the URL components. The encoding is directly applied where necessary using the `encode` method. The concatenation of request components is also handled properly, ensuring a valid HTTP request format.
