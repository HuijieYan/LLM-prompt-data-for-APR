## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function request_httprepr() is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. It first parses the request using urlparse_cached, then constructs the HTTP request string, and finally returns the resulting bytes.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The use of urlparse_cached() could potentially cause an error if the input request is not a valid URL.
2. The concatenation of request.body without checking if it exists could lead to a NoneType error.

## Cause of the bug:
The potential bugs in this function are:
- If the request is not a valid URL, the function will raise an error when parsing it with urlparse_cached().
- Concatenating request.body without checking if it exists could lead to a NoneType error.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the input request is a valid URL before parsing it with urlparse_cached.
2. Check if request.body exists before concatenating it with the HTTP request string.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    if not request.url:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL")

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += b"\r\n" + request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version:
1. We added a check to ensure that the request.url is not empty or None before parsing it with urlparse_cached to handle invalid URLs.
2. We added a check to verify if request.body exists before concatenating it with the HTTP request string to avoid a NoneType error.
