The issue in the `request_httprepr` function is that it is trying to access the `hostname` attribute in the `parsed` object without checking if `parsed` is `None` or not. This results in the `parsed.hostname` being `None` and causes the `to_bytes` function to fail with a `TypeError`.

To fix this, we need to check if `parsed` is not `None` before accessing its attributes. We can also provide a default value for `parsed.hostname` in case it is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else ''
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
```

With this correction, the function should handle cases where `parsed` is `None` and successfully return the raw HTTP representation without causing a `TypeError`.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test without any errors.
