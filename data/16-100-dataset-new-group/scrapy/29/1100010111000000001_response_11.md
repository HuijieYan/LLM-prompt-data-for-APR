The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the fact that it is assuming all requests are HTTP requests and constructing the HTTP representation based on that assumption.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported protocol: {}".format(parsed.scheme))
```

With this correction, the function checks if the protocol of the request is HTTP or HTTPS before constructing the HTTP representation. If the protocol is not supported, it raises a ValueError.

The corrected function will now pass the failing test as it handles non-HTTP requests gracefully.
