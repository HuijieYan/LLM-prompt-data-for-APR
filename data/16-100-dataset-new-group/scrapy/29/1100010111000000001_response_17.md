The buggy function `request_httprepr` has several potential error locations. 

1. The `urlparse_cached` function could be returning the wrong value for `parsed.path` which can result in an incorrect `path` value.
2. The `urlunparse` function may not handle the `parsed.path` value or other components properly which could result in an incorrect path.
3. The concatenation of `request.method`, `path`, and `HTTP/1.1` may not be in the correct format resulting in an invalid HTTP request line.
4. The `request.headers` might not be formatted correctly, leading to an invalid header string.
5. There could be an issue with concatenating the `request.body` with the rest of the HTTP representation.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling or concatenation of the different components of the HTTP request, such as method, path, headers, and body.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle each component of the HTTP request and ensure that they are concatenated in the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    http_representation = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    http_representation += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for header, value in request.headers.items():
            http_representation += to_bytes(header) + b': ' + to_bytes(value) + b'\r\n'
    http_representation += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        http_representation += to_bytes(request.body)
    return http_representation
```

With this corrected version, the function properly handles the HTTP representation by ensuring that each component is concatenated in the correct format, including the method, path, headers, and body. This should allow the function to pass the failing test without any issues.
