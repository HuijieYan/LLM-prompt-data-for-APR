The buggy function `request_httprepr` is failing because it assumes that the request is always an HTTP request, but it does not handle non-HTTP requests correctly. The `urlparse_cached` function is used to parse the request URL, and the `urlunparse` function is then used to construct a new URL without the scheme and netloc. This will not work for non-HTTP requests because it assumes the presence of a scheme and netloc. Additionally, the `Host` header is only relevant for HTTP requests.

To fix the bug, we need to check the scheme of the request URL and handle non-HTTP requests differently. For non-HTTP requests, we should include the scheme and netloc in the path, and we should not include the `Host` header.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme == 'http' or parsed.scheme == 'https':
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
    else:
        path = urlunparse((parsed.scheme, parsed.netloc, parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now handle non-HTTP requests correctly and pass the failing test.
