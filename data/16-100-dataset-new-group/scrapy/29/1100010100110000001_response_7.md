The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is causing a TypeError due to the `parsed.hostname` being `None` in the failing test. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType` instead of the expected `unicode`, `str` or `bytes` object.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to concatenate it with other strings.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `parsed.hostname` before attempting to concatenate it with other strings. This ensures that the `to_bytes` function won't receive a `NoneType`, preventing the TypeError that was occurring in the failing test.
