## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is designed to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request, but it seems to have a bug in handling non-HTTP requests, as indicated by the failing test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request`.

## Error Location:
The potential error locations within the buggy function include parsing non-HTTP URLs and forming the raw HTTP representation for those URLs.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not properly handling non-HTTP URLs (e.g., "file" or "ftp" protocols), leading to an error when trying to form the raw HTTP representation for those URLs.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle non-HTTP URLs gracefully, ensuring that the raw HTTP representation is formed correctly without causing errors for non-HTTP requests.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    if parsed.scheme in ["http", "https"]:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        # For non-HTTP requests, just return the raw representation of the URL
        return to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.geturl()) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n\r\n"
```

With the corrections made, the `request_httprepr` function can handle non-HTTP requests gracefully, forming the raw HTTP representation accordingly. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
