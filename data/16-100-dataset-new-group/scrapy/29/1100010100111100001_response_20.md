The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it is trying to access the `parsed.hostname` attribute without checking if `parsed.hostname` exists or is not empty, which causes a `NoneType` error in some cases.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` is not empty before using it to construct the HTTP representation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding the `if parsed.hostname:` condition, we ensure that the `parsed.hostname` attribute is not empty before using it. This fix will prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.
