The buggy function `request_httprepr` is meant to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could be causing it to fail for non-HTTP requests.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the function assuming that the request is an HTTP request, and as a result, it attempts to generate an HTTP representation even for non-HTTP requests such as "file://" or "ftp://" requests.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the request is an HTTP request before attempting to generate the HTTP representation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    if request.url.startswith('http'):
        parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        return b""  # return empty bytes for non-HTTP requests
```

With this fix, the function now checks if the request URL starts with "http" before generating the HTTP representation. If it's not an HTTP request, the function simply returns empty bytes, which will handle non-HTTP requests without causing the function to fail.
