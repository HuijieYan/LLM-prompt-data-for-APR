## Analysis:
The bug occurs when generating the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. 
The bug is not handling non-standard ports and username/password in the URL properly, which causes incorrect path and hostname extraction.
It also does not account for the case where request.headers is None, which leads to an AttributeError.

## Potential error locations:
1. Parsing the URL and extracting the path and hostname.
2. Handling the request headers.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by not handling non-standard ports and username/password in the URL properly, as well as not accounting for the case where request.headers is None.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct method to extract the path and hostname from the URL, accounting for non-standard ports and username/password.
2. Check if request.headers is None before trying to use it to avoid an AttributeError.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)

        user_pass, netloc = netloc.split("@", 1)
    else:
        user_pass = None
    if ":" in netloc:
        hostname, port = netloc.split(":", 1)
    else:
