The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it incorrectly forms the `Host` header when the request URL has a different scheme other than `http` or `https`. As a result, the `Host` header is not properly set, leading to potential issues when making the request.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the `Host` header is constructed to use the `netloc` attribute of the parsed URL, rather than just the `hostname`. This will ensure that the `Host` header is correctly formatted for all types of URLs.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"  # Use parsed.netloc instead of parsed.hostname
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the `Host` header will correctly include the port (if present) and be formatted based on the entire `netloc` attribute, ensuring that the request is properly formed regardless of the URL scheme.
