The buggy function `request_httprepr` is trying to construct an HTTP representation of a request, but it fails when the request is not an HTTP request. The relevant error message is `TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType`. This occurs because, in the case of non-HTTP requests, `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which causes an error when trying to concatenate it to the byte string.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before concatenating it to the byte string. If it's `None`, we should handle it differently.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function should now handle non-HTTP requests without raising an error.
