The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it always constructs an HTTP/1.1 request, even for non-HTTP requests (e.g., file, ftp). This causes the `Host` header to be incorrectly included for non-HTTP requests, leading to incorrect representations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests properly and exclude the `Host` header for non-HTTP requests.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    if parsed.scheme in ('http', 'https'):
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" FTP/1.0\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the function now checks the scheme of the parsed URL and constructs the appropriate representation for HTTP/1.1 and FTP/1.0 requests. The `Host` header is included only for HTTP requests.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
