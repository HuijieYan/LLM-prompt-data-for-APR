The buggy function `request_httprepr` has several issues that are causing it to fail the test.

1. It incorrectly constructs the `s` string using the parsed hostname for non-HTTP requests, resulting in an invalid HTTP header.
2. It uses the wrong protocol in the constructed HTTP header for non-HTTP requests.
3. It does not handle non-HTTP requests correctly, leading to incorrect representations.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check the scheme of the URL before constructing the HTTP header and handle non-HTTP requests appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        return b""  # Return empty bytes for non-HTTP requests
```

With this corrected version, the function checks the scheme of the URL and only constructs the HTTP header for HTTP and HTTPS requests. For non-HTTP requests, it returns an empty byte string.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
