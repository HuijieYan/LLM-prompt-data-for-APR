The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused because the `parsed.hostname` is not set for non-HTTP URL schemes, resulting in `parsed.hostname` being `None`. This results in a `NoneType` being passed to the `to_bytes` function, leading to a `TypeError` being raised.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the scheme is "http" or "https" before adding the hostname to the HTTP representation.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.scheme in ('http', 'https'):  # Check if scheme is HTTP related
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the `request_httprepr` function will now properly handle non-HTTP URL schemes and avoid passing a `None` value to the `to_bytes` function, resolving the `TypeError` issue.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test without any errors.
