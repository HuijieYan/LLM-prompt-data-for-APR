The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is caused by the assumption that the input request is always an HTTP request. This assumption causes the function to fail when a non-HTTP request is passed to it, such as a file or an FTP request.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully, without raising an exception.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected function, a check has been added to ensure that only if the request has a body, it is appended to the `s` variable. This change enables the function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully without raising an exception.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
