The issue with the buggy function `request_httprepr` is that it is incorrectly constructing the HTTP request for non-HTTP protocols, such as "file" and "ftp". The `Host` header is being set incorrectly, and the HTTP method and path are not being handled properly for non-HTTP protocols.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the protocol is 'http://' before constructing the HTTP request and set the `Host` header accordingly. For non-HTTP protocols, it should construct the request differently.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme == 'http' or parsed.scheme == 'https':
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
    else:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"

    return s
```

This fixed version of the function checks if the scheme is 'http' or 'https' before constructing the HTTP request, and constructs the request differently for non-HTTP protocols.

With this fix, the provided failing test should pass, and the corrected function should handle non-HTTP protocols correctly.
