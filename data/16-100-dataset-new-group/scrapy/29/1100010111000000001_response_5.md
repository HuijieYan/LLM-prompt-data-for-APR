The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. There may be an issue with building the 'path' variable using `urlunparse`.
2. There may be an issue with concatenating the 's' variable with other header and body information.
3. There may be an issue with converting non-HTTP requests to raw HTTP representation.

The cause of the bug is that the function 'request_httprepr' is not handling non-HTTP requests correctly, which causes it to fail when non-HTTP request objects are passed to it.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'request_httprepr' function to handle non-HTTP requests and provide a valid raw HTTP representation for both HTTP and non-HTTP requests.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    if not request.url.startswith('http'):
        # For non-HTTP requests, return a basic representation
        return to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(request.url) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n"

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s

```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now properly handle both HTTP and non-HTTP requests and pass the failing test.
