The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is likely due to the use of `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions. The `urlparse_cached` function is used to parse the URL into components, and the `urlunparse` function is used to construct a URL from its components. However, the bug may occur when the URL scheme is not set to "http" or "https", as the function is designed to handle only "http" requests.

To fix the bug, we need to check the URL scheme before constructing the raw HTTP representation. If the scheme is not "http" or "https", we should handle it differently or raise an error.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported URL scheme")
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function will check for the URL scheme and raise a `ValueError` if it's not "http" or "https", preventing the bug from occurring. This fix should make the function pass the failing test as well.
