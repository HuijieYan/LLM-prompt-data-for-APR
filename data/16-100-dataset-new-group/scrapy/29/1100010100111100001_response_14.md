## Bug Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` raised while attempting to concatenate a `NoneType` with a bytes object. The function `to_bytes` is likely returning `None` for the `parsed.hostname`, causing this error. This explains the `TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType` error message.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to concatenate it with a bytes object.

### Corrected Version
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Add a check to ensure parsed.hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
