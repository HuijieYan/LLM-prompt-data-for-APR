The bug in the given function `request_httprepr` is that it does not handle non-HTTP requests properly, causing it to fail for requests that are not HTTP. This is evident from the failing test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request`, which is testing the function with non-HTTP requests and expects it not to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle non-HTTP requests. The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` argument, causing a `TypeError` to be raised.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to properly handle non-HTTP requests and avoid passing `NoneType` arguments to the `to_bytes` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    method = to_bytes(request.method)
    hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b""
    
    if not method:
        method = b"GET"  # Default to GET method if request method is empty
    
    s = method + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body if request.body else b""
    
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle cases where the request method or hostname might be empty or `None`. We also handle cases where the request body might be empty. These modifications ensure that we do not pass `NoneType` arguments to the `to_bytes` function and handle non-HTTP requests correctly.

With this corrected version, the provided failing test should pass without any errors.
