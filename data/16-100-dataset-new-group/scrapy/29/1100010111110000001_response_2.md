The issue in the `request_httprepr` function arises from the `parsed.hostname` being `None` when the URL scheme is not `http` or `https`. This causes an error when attempting to convert it to bytes.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value when it is. Additionally, we should convert the default path from `None` to an empty string to avoid potential issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
  
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
  
    method = to_bytes(request.method)
    hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"
  
    s = method + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By providing a default value for the `parsed.hostname` and converting it to bytes only when it is not `None`, and also converting the default path from `None` to an empty string, we ensure that the function will not encounter the `TypeError` from `to_bytes` when called with non-HTTP URLs, thus fixing the bug.
