The potential errors in the buggy function include:
1. If the `parsed.path` is None, the `urlunparse` function will not handle it correctly.
2. There might be an issue with encoding the request method, path, and hostname.
3. There might be an issue with concatenating the request headers and body to the `s` variable.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when `parsed.path` is None, and it does not properly encode the request method, path, and hostname.

To fix the bug, we can use a strategy by handling the None case for `parsed.path` and using the `to_bytes` function to properly encode the request method, path, and hostname.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = parsed.path if parsed.path else '/'
    path = urlunparse(('', '', path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    method = to_bytes(request.method)
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    headers = to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) if request.headers else b""
    body = request.body if request.body else b""
    s = method + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    s += headers + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we handle the None case for `parsed.path`, properly encode the request method and hostname, and check for the existence of request headers and body before adding them to the `s` variable.
