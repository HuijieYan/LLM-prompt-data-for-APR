The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the incorrect use of the parsed hostname in the `s` string concatenation. The `parsed.hostname` should be used in the `Host` header, but it's not being utilized correctly in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `parsed.hostname` in the `Host` header concatenation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"  # use parsed.hostname or parsed.netloc
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function should now properly construct the HTTP representation for both HTTP and non-HTTP requests and pass the failing test cases.
