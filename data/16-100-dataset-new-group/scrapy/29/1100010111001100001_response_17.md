The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it is incorrectly constructing the HTTP representation for non-HTTP requests. It is using the HTTP/1.1 protocol and setting the `Host` header for non-HTTP urls.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that all requests are HTTP requests. This causes the `Host` header to be set incorrectly and the HTTP method to be used in the raw HTTP representation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests differently. We can check the scheme of the url and if it is not "http" or "https", we can construct the raw HTTP representation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.path) + b" FTP/1.0\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will distinguish between HTTP and non-HTTP requests and construct the raw HTTP representation accordingly. This should fix the failing test case.
