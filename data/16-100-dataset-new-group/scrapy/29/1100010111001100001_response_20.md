The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it always constructs the request line with "HTTP/1.1" regardless of the actual protocol (http, file, ftp, etc.).

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle non-HTTP protocols correctly and always assumes HTTP/1.1.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to construct the request line based on the actual protocol being used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.0\r\n"  # Change HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/1.0
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By changing "HTTP/1.1" to "HTTP/1.0" in the request line, we address the bug and make the function handle non-HTTP protocols correctly.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
