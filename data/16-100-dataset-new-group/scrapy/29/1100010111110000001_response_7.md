The cause of the bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that the `parsed` object returned from `urlparse_cached` may contain a `None` value for `hostname`, which results in `parsed.hostname` being `None`. When this happens, the `to_bytes` function is called with a `None` value, which causes a `TypeError` because it's expecting a string or bytes object.

To fix this bug, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before using it and provide a default value in that case. 

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function should no longer cause a `TypeError` when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This will allow the failing test to pass successfully.
