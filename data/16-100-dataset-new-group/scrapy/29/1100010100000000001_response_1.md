### Analysis:
The function `request_httprepr` takes a request object as input and is supposed to return a raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. The function uses various utility functions from the `scrapy` library to parse the request and construct the raw HTTP representation.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `parsed` variable might not contain the expected values due to incorrect parsing of the request.
2. The concatenation of strings and bytes might result in a TypeError.
3. Accessing the `hostname` property of `parsed` without proper validation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug could be related to incorrect parsing of the request URL or improper conversion of strings to bytes during concatenation, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper parsing of the request URL and handle edge cases.
2. Use appropriate encoding/decoding methods to convert between strings and bytes.
3. Validate the properties of `parsed` before accessing them to avoid potential errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method.strip()) + b" " + to_bytes(path.strip()) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In the corrected version, the `urlparse_cached` function is used to parse the `request.url` and get the required components. The `strip` method is used to remove any leading/trailing whitespaces from the strings. Conditional checks are added to ensure that properties like `hostname` are valid before accessing them. Proper encoding and decoding methods from the scrapy library are used to handle the conversion between strings and bytes.
