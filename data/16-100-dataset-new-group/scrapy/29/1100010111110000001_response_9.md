The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is causing a `TypeError` when the function is called with a non-HTTP request. The error occurs when the function tries to parse the hostname from the request URL, and it encounters a `NoneType` object when the URL scheme is not HTTP.

To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where the request's URL does not have the HTTP scheme. We can modify the function to check the URL scheme before attempting to parse the hostname and construct the raw HTTP representation.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    scheme = parsed.scheme
    if scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        host = b''
    else:
        host = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the `request_httprepr` function will handle non-HTTP request URLs gracefully and construct the raw HTTP representation without encountering the `TypeError` that was previously raised.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test provided.
