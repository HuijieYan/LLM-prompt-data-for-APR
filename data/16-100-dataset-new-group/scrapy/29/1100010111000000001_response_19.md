The error is in the `request_httprepr` function, as it assumes that the input request is an HTTP request. When the input request is not an HTTP request, the function fails.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully by checking the scheme of the URL and only including the necessary parts in the raw HTTP representation. If the scheme is not HTTP, we can default the method to GET and exclude the host and headers from the representation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme.lower() != 'http':
        method = b"GET"
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function will handle non-HTTP requests gracefully and the failing test will pass.
