The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it assumes the presence of a `hostname` attribute in the `parsed` object. In the case of a non-HTTP request, such as "file://" or "ftp://", the `parsed` object does not have a `hostname` attribute, which causes the error.

To fix this bug, we need to check whether the parsed URL is an HTTP URL before trying to extract the `hostname`. If it's not an HTTP URL, we can use a default hostname or handle the case differently.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for the presence of the `hostname` attribute before trying to use it. If `parsed.hostname` exists, it will be added to the raw HTTP representation. If it doesn't, the representation will be created without the `Host` header. This will prevent the TypeError that was occurring in the failing test.
