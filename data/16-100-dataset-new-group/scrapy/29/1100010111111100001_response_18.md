The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is occurring because in the second test case, the `parsed.hostname` value is being set to `None`. This is leading to a `NoneType` error when it is passed to the `to_bytes` function, which is expecting a string.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. One way to do this is to set the `parsed.hostname` to an empty string if it is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Handle the case where parsed.hostname is None
    hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b''
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
