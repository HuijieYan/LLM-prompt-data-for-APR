The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is occurring because the `to_bytes` function is being called with a `None` value for the `text` parameter, which is not handled properly and causes a `TypeError` to be raised.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `to_bytes` is called with a `None` value and return an empty bytes object in this case.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n" if parsed.hostname else b""
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body if request.body else b""
    return s
```

In this corrected version, we added a conditional statement to check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None`. If it is not `None`, we concatenate it to the `s` variable; otherwise, we append an empty bytes object. We also added a similar conditional statement for the `request.body` to handle the case where it is `None`.

With these changes, the `to_bytes` function will not be called with a `None` value, and the bug should be fixed.
