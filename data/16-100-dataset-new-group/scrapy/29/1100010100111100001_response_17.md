The cause of the bug is that `parsed.hostname` can be `None` for non-HTTP requests, which causes `to_bytes()` to raise a `TypeError` when it tries to convert `None` to bytes.

To fix this bug, you can check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With the corrected version, the function now checks if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to include it in the raw HTTP representation, avoiding the `TypeError` that was raised previously.
