The potential error in the buggy function is that it does not handle non-HTTP requests correctly. The function assumes that the request always has an HTTP structure, but the test case provided passes non-HTTP requests, which causes the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if the request is HTTP or non-HTTP. If it is a non-HTTP request, we can handle it differently or just return an empty byte string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    # Check if the scheme is HTTP
    if parsed.scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        return b""  # return empty byte string for non-HTTP requests

    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will now handle non-HTTP requests correctly and return an empty byte string for non-HTTP requests, which will make the provided test case pass.
