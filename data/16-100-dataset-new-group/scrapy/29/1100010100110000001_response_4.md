The buggy function is `request_httprepr`, which is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` being raised in the `to_bytes` function, specifically with the variable `text` being of type `NoneType`. This occurs when trying to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes using `to_bytes`.

The cause of the bug is that `parsed.hostname` is None, and the `to_bytes` function does not handle NoneType objects. To fix this bug, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is None, and if so, replace it with an empty string before converting to bytes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition `if parsed.hostname:` to check if `parsed.hostname` is not None before trying to convert it to bytes. This will prevent the `TypeError` when the hostname is None.
