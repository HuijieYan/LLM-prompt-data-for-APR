The error message "TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType" indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object, which it cannot handle. This could be happening when trying to parse the hostname from the URL and it turns out to be `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the hostname is `None` before using it with the `to_bytes` function, and handle the case where it is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if parsed.hostname` before trying to use it with the `to_bytes` function. This will prevent the `NoneType` error when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. Now the corrected function should not produce the previous error and pass the failing test.
