The bug in the function `request_httprepr` is that it does not handle the case where the parsed URL does not contain a hostname. This causes the `to_bytes()` function to receive a `None` type as the `text` parameter, leading to a `TypeError` because the function expects a string, unicode, or bytes object.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `parsed` object has a hostname before concatenating it to the `s` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the function will now check if the parsed URL has a hostname before attempting to concatenate it to the `s` variable. This will prevent the `TypeError` that occurred previously and the function should pass the failing test cases.
