The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is likely due to the `parsed.hostname` being `None` for non-HTTP requests, causing the `to_bytes` function to fail with a `NoneType` error.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`, and ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not required for non-HTTP requests.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if hostname is available
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a check for `parsed.hostname` before using it, we can avoid the `NoneType` error when it's not available. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function can handle non-HTTP requests correctly.
