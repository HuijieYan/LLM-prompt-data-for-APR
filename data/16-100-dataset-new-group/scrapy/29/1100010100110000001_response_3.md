The buggy function is `request_httprepr` and the error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function. The error message shows that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `unicode, str, or bytes` object.

The bug is likely occurring in the `urlunparse` function, where it is returning `None` for the `hostname` attribute, causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value. We can set a default value of an empty string for the `hostname` attribute if it is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else ''
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the `request_httprepr` function should handle the case where `parsed.hostname` can be `None` and provide a default empty string value, fixing the `TypeError` that was occurring.
