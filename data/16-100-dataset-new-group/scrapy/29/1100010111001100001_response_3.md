The buggy function is `request_httprepr` and it is failing the test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` because it is not handling non-HTTP requests correctly.

The potential error in the function is that it assumes the request follows HTTP protocol, which is not the case for non-HTTP requests like FTP or file requests.

The cause of the bug is that for non-HTTP requests, the function incorrectly constructs the HTTP representation, including the Host header and the HTTP method.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle non-HTTP requests. This can be done by checking the scheme of the request. If it is not 'http' or 'https', the function should handle the request as a non-HTTP request and construct the representation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    if parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:
        path = parsed.path or '/'
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.scheme.upper()) + b"/1.0\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
    else:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
    
    return s
```

With this correction, the function should now handle non-HTTP requests correctly and pass the failing test.
