The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the `parsed.hostname` being `None` when the request is not an HTTP request, which causes the `to_bytes` function to fail due to the `None` value.

To fix this bug, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value, such as an empty string, in that case. This will prevent the `to_bytes` function from failing when it encounters a `None` value.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    host = to_native_str(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else ''
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` is replaced with `to_bytes(host)`, where `host` is either the parsed hostname or an empty string if it's `None`.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
