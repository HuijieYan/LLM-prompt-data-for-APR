The error message indicates that a TypeError is being raised in the to_bytes function, specifically when calling to_bytes(parsed.hostname) in the request_httprepr function. This suggests that the parsed.hostname variable is None, causing the to_bytes function to throw an error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where parsed.hostname is None and provide a default value for the hostname in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Check if parsed.hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, I added a conditional check to ensure that parsed.hostname is not None before converting it to bytes. This will prevent the TypeError that was being raised in the original buggy function.
