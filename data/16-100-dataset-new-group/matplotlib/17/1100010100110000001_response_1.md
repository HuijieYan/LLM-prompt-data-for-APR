In the buggy function `nonsingular`, there is a condition `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` that depends on the difference between `vmax` and `vmin`. It is likely that an overflow could occur when the two numbers are large and their difference is calculated, resulting in the RuntimeWarning messages. The suggested strategy is to remove the "elif" condition and replace it with an "if" condition in order to handle both cases independently.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if not increasing:
        if vmax < vmin:
            vmax, vmin = vmin, vmax

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
    
    return vmin, vmax
  ```

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests. This version separates the checks for increasing order and the threshold checks for the interval difference, preventing the overflow issues encountered in the original version.
