The bug occurs because the `nonsingular` function may result in an overflow error, especially when the input values are large integers. The error messages indicate that an overflow is encountered in scalar subtract and in scalar absolute.

To fix the bug, we will modify the `nonsingular` function to handle overflows by first converting the input values to floating-point before performing operations. This will prevent overflow issues when dealing with large integer inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.
    
    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)
    """
    # Convert input to floating-point to avoid overflow issues
    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this modification, the `nonsingular` function will now handle large integer inputs without causing overflow errors. You should now be able to run the failing test without encountering the overflow warnings.
