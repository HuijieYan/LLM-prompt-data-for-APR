The buggy function has multiple issues, and the errors are pervasive throughout the code:

1. The function lacks proper handling for infinity values and NaN. These cases need to be explicitly checked and handled.
2. The calculation logic for adjusting the endpoints, especially when the interval is too small, appears to be incorrect. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is leading to incorrect adjustments in several cases, leading to failing test results.
3. The logic for the 'swapped' flag and updating vmin and vmax based on increasing=True/False conditions is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we'll have to rework the entire `nonsingular` function, adding explicit handling for infinity and NaN, updating the conditions for adjusting the interval, and maintaining the correct values for vmin and vmax based on the 'increasing' parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if abs(vmax - vmin) < tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            mid = (vmax + vmin) / 2
            vmin = mid - expander
            vmax = mid + expander

    if increasing:
        return vmin, vmax
    else:
        return vmax, vmin
```

This corrected function handles the case for infinity and NaN, updates the adjustment condition, and mentions the condition for maintaining vmin and vmax based on the 'increasing' parameter.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases.
