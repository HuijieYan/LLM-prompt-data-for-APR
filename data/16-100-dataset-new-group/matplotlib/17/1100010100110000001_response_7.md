The function `nonsingular` takes in 5 parameters: `vmin`, `vmax`, `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`. Its purpose is to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

The failing tests are raising `RuntimeWarning` with the message `overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `overflow encountered in scalar absolute` when the function `nonsingular` is called. This suggests that there is an overflow issue and the function's calculation involves operations that are producing an overflow.

The overflow issue could occur in two places: 
1. In the line `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. This line is comparing two float numbers, and if the difference `vmax - vmin` is very small compared to `maxabsvalue * tiny`, it results in an overflow warning.
2. In the line `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`, where the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` are being compared and assigned to `maxabsvalue`. This comparison might result in an overflow.

To fix the bug, one potential strategy is to explicitly handle edge cases where overflow is occurring and avoid calculations that are leading to overflow.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < np.finfo(float).max * tiny:
        if abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is changed to `maxabsvalue < np.finfo(float).max * tiny` to avoid overflowing the integer range.
- The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is now inside the previous `if` block to ensure it is checked only if the outer `if` condition is True.
- There is a new condition for handling `not increasing and vmax < vmin`, which is supposed to ensure that if not increasing and the vmax is still less than the vmin, the values are swapped, as intended.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and not raise any overflow warnings.
