To fix the provided buggy function `nonsingular`, we need to correct the overflow errors that are causing the failing tests. The reason for the bug is that the function doesn't properly handle the overflow encountered when computing absolute values and scalar subtractions, leading to runtime warnings and incorrect values returned.

To fix this bug, we should add checks to ensure that arithmetic operations do not result in overflows. This can be accomplished by implementing conditional statements to prevent overflow issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            if abs(vmin) > abs(vmax):
                dv = expander * abs(vmin)
            else:
                dv = expander * abs(vmax)

            # Prevent overflow during addition
            if vmax > 0 and vmax + dv < vmax:
                vmax = np.inf
            else:
                vmax += dv

            if vmin < 0 and vmin - dv > vmax:
                vmin = -np.inf
            else:
                vmin -= dv

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the updated function, we added conditional statements to prevent overflow issues during addition and subtraction. This should resolve the runtime warnings and the incorrect values that are causing the failing tests.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable values and pass the failing tests.
