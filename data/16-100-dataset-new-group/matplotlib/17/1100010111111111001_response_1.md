The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs due to the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` not being checked correctly. This condition is being evaluated based on the maximum absolute value of the minimum and maximum endpoints. However, in some cases, this condition might not be valid, resulting in incorrect assignment of expanded values.

To fix this bug, the `nonsingular` function should be modified to enhance the condition checking.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
        
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
            
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function ensures that the conditions are checked accurately, leading to correct expansion and swapping of endpoints. It should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
