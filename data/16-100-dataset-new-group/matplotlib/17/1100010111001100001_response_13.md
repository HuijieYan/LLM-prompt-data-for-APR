The bug in the `nonsingular` function causes it to misbehave when the input `vmin` and `vmax` values are too small or too large. This is because the `tiny` and `maxabsvalue` calculations are incorrect and lead to incorrect expansion of the input range endpoints.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions for checking the input range size to ensure that the correct expansions are made when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if vmin == vmax or abs(vmax - vmin) < tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)):
        meanv = (vmax + vmin) / 2
        vmin = meanv - tiny / 2
        vmax = meanv + tiny / 2

    if increasing:
        return min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)
    else:
        return max(vmin, vmax), min(vmin, vmax)
```

This version of the function should pass the failing test cases by correctly avoiding singularities and swapping the endpoints when necessary.
