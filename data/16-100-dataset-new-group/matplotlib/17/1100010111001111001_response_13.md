The cause of the bug in the `nonsingular` function is due to the incorrect implementation of the logic to handle exceptional cases and singularities. The function includes a swap for the input values `vmin` and `vmax` if `vmax < vmin`, and then sets `vmin` and `vmax` to specific values based on some conditions. However, the logic for setting the values of `vmin` and `vmax` is faulty, leading to incorrect results for some input cases.

The steps for fixing the bug include:
1. Rework the logic for setting the values of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the provided conditions to properly handle exceptional cases and avoid singularities.
2. Ensure that the provided test cases for the failing tests are satisfied after fixing the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    diff = vmax - vmin
    if diff < tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected function should satisfy all the provided failing test cases.
