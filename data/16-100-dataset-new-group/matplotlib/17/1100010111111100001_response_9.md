To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small, and neither `vmin` or `vmax` are zero, we need to expand the interval. Additionally, we need to address the RuntimeWarning issues related to overflow encountered in the arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    diff = vmax - vmin

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif diff <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expansion = expander * maxabsvalue
            vmin -= expansion
            vmax += expansion

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The changes made to the function include:
1. Added a variable `diff` to capture the difference between `vmin` and `vmax`.
2. Utilized this `diff` in the else-if condition to check if the difference is smaller than the allowed threshold, and if so, expanded `vmin` and `vmax` based on `maxabsvalue`.

These changes should address the issues and the function is expected to pass the failing tests.
