The bug in the `nonsingular` function is due to the comparison of very large numbers leading to an overflow warning. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where `vmax` and `vmin` have large differences between them. This causes the overflow warning when calculating `maxabsvalue` in the `nonsingular` function.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to consider two cases where `vmax` and `vmin` can have large differences. First, if the difference is greater than the threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints, the function should expand the interval. Second, if `vmin` and `vmax` are both close to zero, return `-expander, expander`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    # Handling the condition of large differences between vmin and vmax
    if vmax - vmin > maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should now handle the cases where large differences between `vmax` and `vmin` could lead to overflow warnings.

Please test the updated function with the failing test cases to ensure that the bug has been fixed.
