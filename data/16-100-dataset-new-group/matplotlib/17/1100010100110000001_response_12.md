The root cause of the bug is the potential overflow that occurs due to performing operations with large integers. The error messages indicate that "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" in one place and "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute" in another place. This suggests that the operations inside the function `nonsingular` are causing an overflow when dealing with large integers.

To fix the bug, the function `nonsingular` needs to handle these large integers correctly to avoid the overflow. One potential fix for this issue is to explicitly convert the boundary values `vmin` and `vmax` to `float`, which would prevent overflow when performing arithmetic operations on them.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.
    ... (rest of the docstring and parameters remain unchanged) ...
    """

    # Explicitly converting to float
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, `vmin` and `vmax` are explicitly converted to `float` before any arithmetic operations. This ensures that the arithmetic operations are performed with floating-point precision, preventing overflow when dealing with large integer values.
