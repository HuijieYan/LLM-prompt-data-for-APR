The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to manipulate the values of `vmin` and `vmax` in ways that could lead to overflow or loss of precision. In the failing tests, inputs are passing border values for which the current implementation of the function is not accounting correctly, leading to overflow errors.

To fix this issue, we should avoid unnecessary and dangerous operations on floating-point values. Specifically, when the magnitude of the input values is close to the precision limit, we should avoid arithmetic operations that might lead to overflow or loss of precision.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected function now avoids potential overflow by using safe arithmetic operations. This should resolve the issue with the failing tests.
