Here is the corrected version of the function based on my analysis:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0) or (vmax < vmin):
        return -expander, expander

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * maxabsvalue
        vmax += expander * maxabsvalue

    if not increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

Explanation:
1. The condition for checking infinite values and the condition for handling vmin and vmax both being zero have been combined in one if statement. Also, the condition for handling vmax < vmin has been added.
2. The calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent condition to expand `vmin` and `vmax` has been modified to avoid errors.
3. The final if condition to swap vmin and vmax has been updated to ensure that the swap only occurs if `vmin` is greater than `vmax`, based on the increasing parameter.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
