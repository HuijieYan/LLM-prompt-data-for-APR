The bug occurs when the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is met. This line of code erroneously specifies that if the difference between vmax and vmin is less than or equal to maxabsvalue multiplied by tiny, then vmin and vmax should be modified. This condition seems to be too aggressive and is causing vmin and vmax to be modified when it may not be necessary. 

To fix this bug, we can add an additional condition to check that the interval bounds are not too close to each other. This will prevent unnecessary modification of vmin and vmax, thus resolving the issue.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmax > vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif (vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny) and (maxabsvalue * tiny < 1):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function includes an additional condition to check that the interval bounds are not too close to each other before modifying `vmin` and `vmax`. This will prevent unnecessary adjustments and handle different scenarios of `vmin` and `vmax` properly.
