The error messages suggest that there are RuntimeWarnings related to overflow encountered in scalar subtract and scalar absolute operations in the `nonsingular` function. This could be caused by the calculations performed with the input values `vmin` and `vmax` that are exceeding the floating-point limits.

To fix the bug, we can introduce additional checks to handle the cases where the input values are very large or very small, causing overflows or underflows during calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded. This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the updated function, we added an additional condition to check if the input values `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero (0). If so, it will return the corresponding values to avoid potential runtime warnings about overflow or underflow. We also rearranged the conditions for increasing and decreasing cases to handle swapping effectively.
