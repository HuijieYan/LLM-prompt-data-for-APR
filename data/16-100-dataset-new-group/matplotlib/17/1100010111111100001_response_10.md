The buggy function `nonsingular` has a few issues. One critical issue is that it attempts to calculate the maximum absolute value from int16 values, leading to potential overflow and incorrect calculations. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

To address the bugs in the function, it is necessary to handle int16 input values appropriately and revise the logic for expanding the interval. 

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue == 0 or maxabsvalue * tiny < tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    elif np.isclose(vmax, vmin, rtol=0, atol=tiny):
        return vmin - expander, vmax + expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the issues by checking for the case where the input values are 0 or very close to zero explicitly and returning the expanded values accordingly. Additionally, it uses `np.isclose` to handle comparisons between floating-point values appropriately.

With this corrected version of the `nonsingular` function, the failing tests should pass without encountering overflow errors.
