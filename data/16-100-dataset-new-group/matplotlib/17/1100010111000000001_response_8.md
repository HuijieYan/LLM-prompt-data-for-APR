The bug in the function "nonsingular" lies in the logic used to handle the case where the interval is smaller than the threshold "tiny". This causes incorrect expansion of the interval, leading to failing tests in scenarios where the interval is small.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves reevaluating the condition for interval expansion and the logic used to handle the smaller interval case. Specifically, the calculations for vmin and vmax adjustments need to be adjusted to ensure correct expansion while keeping the interval proportional.

Here's the corrected version of the "nonsingular" function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        if (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                center = (vmax + vmin) / 2
                vmin = center - maxabsvalue * tiny / 2
                vmax = center + maxabsvalue * tiny / 2

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the issue by adjusting the logic under the condition `if (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:`. By using the interval center and adjusting vmin and vmax proportionally, the corrected function ensures that the interval expansion is handled correctly.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
