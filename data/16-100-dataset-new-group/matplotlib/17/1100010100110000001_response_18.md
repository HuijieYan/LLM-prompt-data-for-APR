The buggy function `nonsingular` is returning incorrect values causing overflow and RuntimeWarning messages due to some of the conditions not being handled correctly. The problem appears to be in the range calculation when the given interval is too small.

The cause of the bug is that when the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small, the condition to handle this case is not written correctly causing a potential overflow of the calculation and, in turn, triggering the RuntimeWarning messages.

To fix the bug, we should handle the condition where the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small. Instead of checking directly if `vmax - vmin` is less than a threshold, we should compare the absolute difference with the threshold.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Swap vmin and vmax if necessary
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if np.isclose(vmax, vmin, rtol=1e-15, atol=1e-15):
        # If absolute difference is very small, expand the interval
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander
    else:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
        if maxabsvalue < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The modified version uses `np.isclose` to check if the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small, and then appropriately expands the interval. This should ensure that the function works correctly without causing any overflow or RuntimeWarning messages.
