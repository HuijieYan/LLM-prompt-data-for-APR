The cause of the error in the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle or prevent the overflow issues that are encountered when dealing with large numbers, such as comparing the difference between vmin and vmax when they are large. As a result, the function triggers a RuntimeWarning when dealing with large values, indicating an overflow issue.

To fix this bug, the function `nonsingular` should be updated to correctly handle the overflow issues and prevent any potential RuntimeWarnings when dealing with large values.

Here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function that resolves the bug:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            temp_vmin = vmin - expander*abs(vmin)
            temp_vmax = vmax + expander*abs(vmax)
            if np.isfinite(temp_vmin) and np.isfinite(temp_vmax):
                vmin = temp_vmin
                vmax = temp_vmax

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles the comparison of large values by taking into account the possibility of overflow and returns `vmin` and `vmax` adjusted within the provided constraints.

With this corrected `nonsingular` function, it should properly avoid singularities and no longer trigger the RuntimeWarning due to overflow encountered in the comparisons. This should cause the failing test to pass without any errors.
