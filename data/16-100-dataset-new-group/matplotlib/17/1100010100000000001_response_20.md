The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, there are some potential error locations within the function that could cause the function to return incorrect or unexpected results.

1. One potential error location is in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`, where the function is using the `max` function directly on the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. However, the `maxabsvalue` should be calculated as the maximum absolute value of the endpoints, which means the condition around it should be revised.

2. There is also a potential error in the condition where `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. Due to floating-point precision limitations, this condition might not accurately reflect the intended logic.

3. The logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` parameter might lead to unexpected results because it doesn't take into account the absolute values of the endpoints and might not work correctly in all cases.

To fix the bug, the function could be revised to better handle the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the condition for expanding the interval. Additionally, the logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` should be carefully reviewed and revised if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == vmax):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    max_abs_diff = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) * tiny
    if vmax - vmin <= max_abs_diff:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    
    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the calculation of `maxabsvalue` is revised to ensure that it accurately represents the maximum absolute difference between the endpoints. Additionally, the condition for expanding the interval is updated to reflect the intended logic more accurately. Lastly, the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` parameter is modified to handle all cases correctly.
