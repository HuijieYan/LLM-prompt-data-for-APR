There are a few issues in the `nonsingular` function that need to be addressed. First, when the function is called with inputs that are not finite (e.g. `np.inf`), the function is returning `-expander, expander` when the correct behavior should be to return `vmin, vmax` as it's essentially skipping the rest of the checks. Second, the `maxabsvalue` calculation is not capturing the desired result, and the condition for correcting the interval size is not functioning properly. 

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made:
1. Return `vmin, vmax` if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not finite.
2. In the `maxabsvalue` calculation, use `np.maximum` to get the maximum between the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.
3. Update the condition for checking if the interval is smaller than `tiny`, either expand the interval by a fractional amount or treat it as an interval approaching the double precision resolution limit.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return vmin, vmax

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = np.maximum(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if (vmax - vmin) < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0.0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0.0):
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        else:
            vmin -= np.copysign(expander*abs(vmin), vmin)
            vmax += np.copysign(expander*abs(vmax), vmax)

    if vmax < vmin and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

With these changes, the function should now work correctly for the provided examples and other cases as well.
