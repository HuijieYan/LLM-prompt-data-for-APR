The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. The comparison of 'vmax' and 'vmin' where 'vmax' is less than 'vmin' could result in an incorrect comparison.
2. The condition where 'vmax - vmin' is less than or equal to 'maxabsvalue * tiny' might not be properly evaluated due to the presence of 'tiny' being multiplied by the wrong variable in the computation.

The cause of the bug in the function is that the conditional checks and reassignments of 'vmin' and 'vmax' based on the interval calculation and the values of 'vmax' and 'vmin' are likely incorrect, leading to undesired results.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and reassignments need to be carefully revised for accuracy. Particularly, the condition where 'vmax - vmin' is checked should be updated to reflect the correct computation for the interval.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif interval <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin / interval)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax / interval)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version:
- A new variable 'interval' is introduced to compute the interval as 'vmax - vmin'.
- The condition that checks 'interval' against 'maxabsvalue * tiny' is updated to use the 'interval' variable for accurate calculation.
- The use of 'abs(vmin / interval)' and 'abs(vmax / interval)' helps to appropriately factor in the interval in the computation of the adjusted 'vmin' and 'vmax'.
- The conditional check for 'swapped' is removed and unnecessary assignments are eliminated.
- The return statement is updated to return 'vmin, vmax' after the adjustments are made, respecting the 'increasing' flag.

These corrections address the identified potential errors in the original buggy function.
