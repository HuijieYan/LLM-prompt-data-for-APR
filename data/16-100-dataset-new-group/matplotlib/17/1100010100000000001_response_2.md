The buggy function `nonsingular` appears to have several potential error locations. Here's an analysis of each potential issue:
1. The function should handle cases where both inputs are inf or NaN, or both are 0 or very close to zero.
2. The condition `if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` may not be properly handling small intervals that need to be expanded.
3. The logic around swapping `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` parameter requires a review.
4. The handling of `expander` and `tiny` within the function might need further considerations.

The main cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the expansion or swapping of the range's endpoints, leading to potential singularities or incorrect results.

To fix the bug, consider updating the conditions for handling small intervals, properly dealing with inf or NaN inputs, and revisiting the logic for swapping the endpoints.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0) or (abs(vmin) < tiny and abs(vmax) < tiny):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if increasing == False:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval = vmax - vmin
    if interval < tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)):
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the updated version of the function, I've removed the unnecessary condition checking and simplified the logic for handling small intervals and swapping endpoints. This should address the potential sources of the bug.
