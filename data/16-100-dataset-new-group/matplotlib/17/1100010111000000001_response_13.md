The bug in the given function seems to be related to the calculation of `vmin` and `vmax` when they are not finite (infinite or NaN). Additionally, the conditions for adjusting the `vmin` and `vmax` based on the interval size seem to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made to the function:
- Remove the block of code that handles the case when `vmin` or `vmax` are not finite, as this should not be causing the issue.
- Update the condition for adjusting `vmin` and `vmax` based on the interval size to ensure that it correctly expands the interval if needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test provided.
