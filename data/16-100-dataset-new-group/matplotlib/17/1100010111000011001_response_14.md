The buggy function has the potential error of incorrectly modifying the endpoints of the given range in the `nonsingular` function that might lead to unexpected outputs. Based on the provided test code and variable values, the cause of the bug in the `nonsingular` function is that it does not handle the input range and endpoint values in accordance with the expectations specified. This can be improved by properly checking and modifying the values of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the conditions provided.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to re-implement the logic inside the `nonsingular` function for modifying the endpoints by transferring necessary conditional checks and corrections to ensure that the variables are modified as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        interval = vmax - vmin
        if interval <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected version of the function accounts for the provided test code and expected input/output variable values. It properly handles the input range and endpoint values in accordance with the specified cases. Therefore, the corrected version of the function is expected to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
