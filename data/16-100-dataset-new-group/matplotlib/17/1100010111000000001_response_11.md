The potential error in the buggy function seems to be related to the calculation and comparison of the vmin and vmax values, especially when dealing with absolute values and the tiny threshold.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the comparison between vmin and vmax correctly, leading to incorrect expansion or swapping. This causes the failing test to not assert the expected (im.norm.vmin, im.norm.vmax) values to be equal to clim.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to review the logic of the function and ensure that the comparison, swapping, and expansion of vmin and vmax are correctly implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if abs(vmax - vmin) <= max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            range_expander = expander * abs(max(vmin, vmax))
            vmin -= range_expander
            vmax += range_expander

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```
This corrected version of the function addresses the comparison, swapping, and expansion logic. It should now pass the failing test.
