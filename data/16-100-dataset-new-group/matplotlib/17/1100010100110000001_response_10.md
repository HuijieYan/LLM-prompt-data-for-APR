The error message is indicating that the buggy function `nonsingular` is encountering overflow and scalar subtract due to the usage of `maxabsvalue`, `expander` and various other conditions.

The probable cause of the bug is that when the interval is very small, the computation does not scale up the interval by the `expander`, which leads to an overflow error.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditions and computations in the `nonsingular` function to properly handle the small interval and prevent overflow scenarios. We also need to address the swapped endpoints and ensure that the given expander does not interfere with the calculation causing the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin < tiny or np.isclose(vmax, vmin):
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, we modified the conditions for scaling the interval using `expander` and fixed the potential overflow and scalar subtract issues. This updated version should pass the failing test cases.
