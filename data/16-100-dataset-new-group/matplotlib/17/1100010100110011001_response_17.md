To correct the buggy function, we need to address the potential errors causing the RuntimeWarning. The warning is triggered due to overflow encountered in scalar subtract while calculating vmax - vmin in the first failing case, and overflow encountered in scalar absolute in the second failing case.

The issue arises when the difference between vmax and vmin exceeds the maximum limit of the data type due to the numeric values involved. To fix this, we can ensure that these values are within the acceptable range.

We can modify the function to handle the potential overflow scenario by checking for the condition when the difference between vmax and vmin exceeds the maximum range and take appropriate actions to prevent overflow.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    # Prevent overflow
    if (vmax - vmin) > (1e308):
        vmin = (vmin / vmax) * 1e308
        vmax = (vmax / vmin) * 1e308

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function includes a conditional check to prevent overflow when the difference between vmax and vmin exceeds the maximum range. This should address the RuntimeWarning and ensure that the function returns the expected values for the given test cases.
