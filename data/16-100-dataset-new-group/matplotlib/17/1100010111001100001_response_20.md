The bug in the current code is that it is not handling cases where the input parameters are approaching the resolution limit of double precision.

The potential cause of the bug is that the code does not correctly handle the edge cases or conditions where the input parameters are very close to zero or very large.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `nonsingular` function to handle these edge cases and specifically address issues related to precision and singularity when the input parameters are very small or large.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or vmin == vmax:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should address the edge cases and conditions where the input parameters are very close to zero or close to the limits of double precision, providing more robust handling of these situations.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
