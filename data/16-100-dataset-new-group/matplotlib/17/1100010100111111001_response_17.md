The cause of the bug is related to the conditional statements in the `nonsingular` function, leading to arithmetic operations that result in an overflow. The buggy function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities. However, it fails to handle edge cases and, as a result, produces incorrect results when dealing with very small or large numbers.

To fix the bug, we can rewrite the conditional statements in the `nonsingular` function to handle edge cases related to input endpoint values. Specifically, we should address conditions where the input values are infinite or NaN, as well as conditions where both inputs are 0 or close to 0.

Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            return vmin - expander * abs(vmin), vmax + expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        return vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly handle cases where the inputs are infinite or NaN, where both inputs are 0 or close to 0, and where the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is met by returning appropriate values.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
