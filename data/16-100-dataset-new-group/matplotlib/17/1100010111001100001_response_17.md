The issue with the `nonsingular` function seems to be with the calculation of the `maxabsvalue` variable, which is used to decide the condition for expanding the interval. Another potential issue arises when swapping the `vmin` and `vmax` values; the function does not handle this correctly if the `increasing` flag is set to `True`.

To fix the bug, we should first ensure that `maxabsvalue` is calculated correctly. Also, to address the swapping issue, the condition checking for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` values needs to be updated.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

Now with this corrected version, the failing tests should pass without issues.
