The buggy function `nonsingular` has the following issues:

1. The function returns incorrect values for `vmin` and `vmax` when either input is infinite, not finite, or 0.
2. The `else` block inside the case `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` seems to be using incorrect logic to handle the expansion.
3. The variable `swapped` is not being updated correctly. It is used to determine whether to swap `vmin` and `vmax` at the end, but the condition for correct swapping is not handled properly.

To fix the issues with the function, we can update the conditions for handling infinite or not finite values, adjust the logic inside the `else` block for handling expansion, and properly update the `swapped` variable based on conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
