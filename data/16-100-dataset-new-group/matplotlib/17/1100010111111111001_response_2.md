The bug in the `nonsingular()` function is caused by a runtime warning of an overflow encountered in scalar subtract and scalar absolute when the function operates on large input values. The issue is particularly apparent in cases where the input values are `int16` data type and the function operates on them as if they were regular float values. This results in the incorrect runtime behavior and the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the input values are of type `int16`, and if so, they should be explicitly cast to `float` before performing any operations on them. This would ensure that the variable types are consistent throughout the function and that the correct numerical operations are performed without the risk of overflow issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular()` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float or int16
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if isinstance(vmin, np.int16):
        vmin = float(vmin)
    if isinstance(vmax, np.int16):
        vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle input values of type `int16` and avoid runtime warnings and overflow issues, satisfying the expected input/output values of the test cases provided.
