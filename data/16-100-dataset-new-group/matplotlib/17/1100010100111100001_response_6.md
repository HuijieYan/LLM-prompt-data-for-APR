The bug in the `nonsingular` function is due to potential overflow issues when performing arithmetic operations with large numbers. The error messages indicate that an overflow and a runtime warning are encountered during subtraction and taking the absolute value of a large number.

To fix this bug, we need to prevent potential overflow by scaling the values when performing arithmetic operations. Specifically, we should check whether the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` or the absolute value of either of them is too large, and if so, scale down the values to avoid potential overflow errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ...
    
    Returns
    -------
    ...
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    threshold = (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny
    if maxabsvalue > threshold:
        scale_factor = threshold / maxabsvalue
        vmin *= scale_factor
        vmax *= scale_factor
        expander *= scale_factor

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function handles the potential overflow issues by scaling down the values when necessary. This should prevent the overflow errors and runtime warnings encountered in the failing tests.
