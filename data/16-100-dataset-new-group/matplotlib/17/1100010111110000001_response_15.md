The function `nonsingular` has two potential areas of errors:
1. The line `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` is causing a RuntimeWarning due to overflow encountered in scalar absolute.
2. The line `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is causing a RuntimeWarning due to overflow encountered in scalar subtract.

The cause of the bug is that the `tiny` variable is too small, causing the interval to approach the double precision resolution limit. It generates overflow warnings in the `abs` and subtraction operations due to numerical precision issues.

To fix the bug, the function logic needs to be adjusted to prevent the `tiny` value from being too small and avoid the overflow errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-12, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * (tiny * 1e3):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `tiny` variable is adjusted to be `1e-12` to avoid approaching the double precision resolution limit. Additionally, the comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is altered to `maxabsvalue * (tiny * 1e3)` to mitigate the overflow warnings.

These changes prevent the overflow warnings associated with `maxabsvalue` and improves the numerical stability of the `nonsingular` function.
