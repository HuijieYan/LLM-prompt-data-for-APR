The issue with the function `nonsingular` is that it lacks handling specifically for the case of very large values for `vmin` and `vmax`. In the failing tests, the function encounters an "overflow encountered" warning due to calculations with the large values received.

To address this issue, we need to add logic that specifically handles the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are very large numbers and takes necessary steps to prevent overflow.

Here's the corrected version of the function `nonsingular`:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    # Case-specific handling for very large values
    if maxabsvalue > 1e6 and (vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
    else:
        if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should be able to handle very large values for `vmin` and `vmax` without encountering overflow and pass the failing tests.
