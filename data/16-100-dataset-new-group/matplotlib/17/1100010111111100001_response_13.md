The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent checks based on it. The issue likely arises when the input values (vmin and vmax) are close to or fall within the double-precision resolution limit, which leads to floating-point inaccuracies and overflows. It seems that the comparison `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` and the subsequent check `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` are causing runtime warnings and potentially incorrect results. 

To fix this bug, we can revise the logic for checking and handling singularities in the `nonsingular` function. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if np.isclose(vmin, vmax, rtol=0, atol=tiny):
        if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This revised approach uses the `np.isclose` function to check if `vmin` and `vmax` are close within a specified tolerance (in this case, `tiny`). If they are close, we apply the necessary expansions. Additionally, we directly handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` need to be swapped based on the `increasing` parameter.

By employing this approach, we address potential issues with floating-point inaccuracies, overflows, and singularities, as indicated by the failing test cases.

The revised function should now pass the failing test cases.
