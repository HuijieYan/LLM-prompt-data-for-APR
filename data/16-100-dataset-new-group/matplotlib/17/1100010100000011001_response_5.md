The cause of the bug:
The bug appears to be caused due to incorrect logic during the calculation of the value for the `maxabsvalue` variable. This leads to incorrect swapping and expansion of the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` in some cases.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Compare the existing logic for the calculation of `maxabsvalue` against the expected calculation, and make necessary corrections.
2. Verify the conditions for swapping and expanding `vmin` and `vmax` to ensure they are aligned with the expected behavior.
3. Handle all edge cases, such as `vmax` being less than `vmin`, intervals smaller than the threshold, and inf or NaN values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 * tiny * np.finfo(float).tiny):
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if increasing:
        return vmin, vmax
    else:
        return vmax, vmin
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the conditions for swapping and expanding `vmin` and `vmax`. It should satisfy all the expected input/output values.
