The bug in the `nonsingular` function in `lib/matplotlib/transforms.py` seems to be related to the calculations and conditional statements leading to runtime warnings about overflow encountered in scalar subtract and overflow encountered in scalar absolute.

Based on the error messages, it seems that the issue is caused by large values being passed to the `nonsingular` function, causing overflow when operations are performed on those values to calculate `maxabsvalue`.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the conditional statements and calculations within the function to handle large values without causing overflow.

Here is a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded. This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    max_tiny = 1e6 / tiny
    if maxabsvalue < max_tiny * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= max_tiny * tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if increasing is False:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By modifying the calculations of `maxabsvalue` and `max_tiny`, we ensure that large input values do not cause overflow when performing calculations within the function.
This corrected version should pass the failing test without encountering overflow warnings.
