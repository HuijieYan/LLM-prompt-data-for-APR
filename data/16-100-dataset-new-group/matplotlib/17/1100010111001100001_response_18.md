The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to incorrect handling of the input endpoints. It appears that the function is not performing the necessary operations to avoid singularities and to correctly expand the range in some cases.

Looking at the failing test, the runtime input/output values, and the behavior of the function, it seems that the main issue is when the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is too small or when they are inf or NaN.

A potential strategy to fix the bug is to re-implement the `nonsingular` function to handle the intervals properly by checking for edge cases, taking into account whether the inputs are inf or NaN, and ensuring that the expansion is done correctly to avoid singularities.

Here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if np.isnan(vmin) or np.isnan(vmax) or np.isinf(vmin) or np.isinf(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0) or (vmax - vmin < tiny):
        return -expander, expander
    elif vmax < vmin:
        if increasing:
            return vmax, vmin
        else:
            return vmin, vmax
    else:
        return vmin - expander * abs(vmin), vmax + expander * abs(vmax)
```

This corrected version of the function handles the cases of inf, NaN, and very small intervals properly, and is expected to pass the failing tests.
