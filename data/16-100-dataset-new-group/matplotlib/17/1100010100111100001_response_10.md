The bug in the code is causing a RuntimeWarning related to overflow encountered in scalar subtract/absolute. This error occurs when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` exceeds the maximum value representable in the given data type. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `nonsingular` function to handle the overflow and absolute value operations that are causing the RuntimeWarning.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        diff = vmax - vmin
        if abs(diff) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) * np.sign(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax) * np.sign(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The changes made to the code include adding an `else` block to handle the case when `diff` exceeds the maximum value, and modifying how the expander is applied to handle large values and avoid overflow. Additionally, the `np.sign` function is used to preserve the sign of the values while applying the expander.

With these changes, the `nonsingular` function should now handle the edge cases that were leading to overflows and RuntimeWarnings.
