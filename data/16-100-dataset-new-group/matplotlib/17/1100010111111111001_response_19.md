Based on the provided information, the potential error locations within the `nonsingular` function are related to calculations involving small values and numerical precision. The function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The issues arise when the interval is small enough to cause numerical problems or when handling large absolute values. This is evident from the error message related to overflow and absolute scalar operations.

To fix the bug, the following strategy is suggested:
1. Check the condition for the interval being too small and adjust the endpoints accordingly, considering the numerical precision of floating-point values.
2. Implement appropriate handling for large absolute values to avoid overflow and ensure the correct values of `vmin` and `vmax` are returned.

Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) * (1 if vmin > 0 else -1)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) * (1 if vmax > 0 else -1)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The correction involves handling the case when the interval is too small by performing the adjustment needed to avoid singularities based on the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. Also, the handling of large absolute values is adjusted to avoid overflow encounters and ensure that the correct values of `vmin` and `vmax` are returned.

With this corrected function, the failing tests are expected to pass, and the function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
