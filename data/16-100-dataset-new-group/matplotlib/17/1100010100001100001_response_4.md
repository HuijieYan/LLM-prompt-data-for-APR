The current implementation of the `nonsingular` function has a bug that causes incorrect behavior in some cases. The issues arise from the comparison of floating point values and the logic used to expand the range given certain conditions. I will propose to adjust these comparisons and modify the logic for the expansion to fix the bug. 

Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
from numpy import finfo, isfinite

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not isfinite(vmin) or not isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if vmax - vmin <= expander:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0) or (vmin < 0 and vmax > 0):
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if increasing:
        return vmin, vmax
    else:
        return vmax, vmin
```

The comparisons have been modified to ensure all scenarios are covered regardless of the specific values and condition. Additionally, the logic for expanding the range has been adjusted to better handle different limit cases.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the input parameters and return the expected results for all cases.
