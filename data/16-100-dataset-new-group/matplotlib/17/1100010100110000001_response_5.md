In the given function, the potential error locations include the areas where numerical operations are being performed, such as comparisons, inequalities, and scalar arithmetic. The error messages show that there are issues with the numerical operations, specifically with overflow and scalar subtraction.

The cause of the bug is that the function's implementation is not handling edge cases properly, leading to potential overflow and scalar arithmetic issues. The function is not checking for cases where the absolute value of the input endpoints might result in mathematical issues.

To fix the bug, we need to handle edge cases explicitly to avoid overflow and scalar arithmetic issues. Specifically, we should check for conditions where the absolute value of the endpoints might result in overflow, and handle those conditions separately.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function that addresses the issues:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue <= (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            # Evaluate the differences based on the signs of vmin and vmax
            if vmax >= 0 and vmin <= 0:  # Mixed signs
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
            elif vmax < 0:  # Both values are negative
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax -= expander * abs(vmax)
            else:  # Both values are positive
                vmin += expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function includes explicit handling for edge cases by evaluating the differences based on the signs of `vmin` and `vmax`. This approach mitigates the potential overflow and scalar subtraction issues that were encountered in the original implementation.
