The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be that the function is not properly considering the range of values that can be obtained with the given input format. It is also mistakenly performing operations with values of type `int16` and `float64`, when it effectively should consider all values as floating-point numbers.

Considering the collected runtime input/output values and test output, it seems that the error occurs when handling the input values that are close to the minimum and maximum range of possible values for `int16`. 

A strategy to fix this bug would be to ensure that all comparisons and calculations are performed with floating-point arithmetic, even when the input values are integers. Additionally, the function should properly consider the possible ranges of input values and the potential for overflow.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if float(vmax) < float(vmin):
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / float(tiny)) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif float(vmax) - float(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if float(vmax) == 0 and float(vmin) == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(float(vmin))
            vmax += expander*abs(float(vmax))

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected function code ensures that all manipulations are done with floating-point numbers and properly checks for absolute values.

With this correction, the failing test cases are expected to pass.
