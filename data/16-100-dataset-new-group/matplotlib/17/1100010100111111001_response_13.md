### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes various parameters and performs calculations to determine the modified endpoints. The error messages indicate that there are overflow issues encountered during the calculations, likely due to incorrect handling of edge cases and large input values. The function involves comparing `vmin` and `vmax`, finding the maximum absolute value, and applying certain conditions based on the result.

### Bugs
1. The `maxabsvalue` compared against the value `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` can lead to an overflow due to the magnitude of the maxabsvalue.
2. In the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`, the subtraction can overflow when the numbers are very large.

### Bug Fixes
1. Ensure that potential overflow issues are handled when comparing `maxabsvalue`.
2. Use safe arithmetic operations and avoid direct comparisons that might result in overflow.

### Bug-fixed function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    max_possible_value = (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny
    if maxabsvalue > max_possible_value:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        diff = vmax - vmin
        if diff <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
