The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition that checks if either *vmin* or *vmax* is infinite or not.
2. The condition that checks if the interval is smaller than *tiny* and needs to be expanded.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the interval expansion logic inside the `nonsingular` function is incorrect. It doesn't properly handle the cases where vmin or vmax is negative and doesn't cover all possible scenarios where the interval needs to be expanded.

One strategy to fix the bug is to rewrite the interval expansion logic to correctly handle cases where the interval is too small or the endpoints are infinite or NaN. By analyzing the logic and using conditional statements, the function can be fixed to ensure that the interval expansion is performed based on the correct conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:  # Only swap if increasing is True
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    elif vmin < vmax and not increasing:  # Swap if increasing is False
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if abs(vmax - vmin) <= max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) < tiny and abs(vmin) < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the interval expansion logic has been modified to handle the cases where the interval is too small based on the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints. The swap logic has also been corrected to respect the `increasing` parameter.
