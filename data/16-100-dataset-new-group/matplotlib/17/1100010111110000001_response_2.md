The buggy function `nonsingular` has a conditional statement that seems to be problematic. The test code `test_colorbar_int` implies that the `vmin` and `vmax` values are being converted into `np.int16` data type. This conversion appears to cause arithmetic errors that result in `RuntimeWarning` messages. 

The bug arises from the fact that, after the conditional statement, there is a series of mathematical operations based on `vmin` and `vmax` that do not take into account the specific requirements of the `np.int16` data type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input `vmin` and `vmax` are properly recognized as `np.int16` data type, and handle the mathematical operations accordingly.

The following is a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    # Cast vmin and vmax as float
    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    # Ensuring that vmin and vmax are handled as np.float64
    vmin_float = np.float64(vmin)
    vmax_float = np.float64(vmax)

    if vmax_float - vmin_float <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
The corrected version casts the input `vmin` and `vmax` as float (np.float64) to ensure that the mathematical operations are performed correctly. Additionally, the `vmin` and `vmax` are checked to ensure they are finite, and the `maxabsvalue` is calculated correctly while avoiding arithmetic errors caused by the data type mismatch.
