The cause of the bug is that the `nonsingular` function is not handling the cases where the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero and are finite, resulting in the wrong outputs.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic within the `nonsingular` function to handle cases where the input parameters are close to zero and finite. We can do this by explicitly checking for these conditions and applying the required adjustments to `vmin` and `vmax` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
        return -expander, expander

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        if vmax < vmin:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version includes explicit checks for the conditions where `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero and applies the necessary adjustments to avoid the bug.

With this corrected version, the failing tests should pass.
