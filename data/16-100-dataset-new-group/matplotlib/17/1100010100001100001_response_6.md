The cause of the bug seems to be a condition on the size of the interval which can make vmin and vmax very close to each other, leading to the expander not being correctly calculated. In addition, if vmin and vmax are not finite, the function returns -expander and expander without further processing.

To fix the bug in the provided function, you need to change the logic in the function so that it checks for various conditions (e.g., infinite values, small intervals, zero values) and accordingly modifies the vmin and vmax values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or vmax == vmin == 0:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if abs(vmax - vmin) < tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)):
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By making these changes to the function, it properly handles the edge cases where vmin and vmax are not finite, or where the difference between them is very small.
