The bug seems to be in the conditional statements in the function, especially in the part that checks for a small interval and expands it. The cases in which the function fails all involve swaps, which can cause the function to return the incorrect values. Additionally, the logic for expanding the interval is problematic, as it does not seem to adhere to the intended threshold.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks need to be revised to ensure that the endpoints are correctly expanded or swapped based on the specified conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these modifications, the function's conditions have been corrected to account for the necessary endpoint expansions and swaps. This corrected version should now return the expected results for the given input cases.
