The main issue with the function seems to be the comparison and manipulation of the numerical values, especially around the checking for singularities and swapping of endpoints. It's possible that the floating-point precision is causing some inconsistencies in the results, particularly when the vmin and vmax values are very close or very large.

To fix the bug, we should revise the checks for singularities and swapping of values to ensure the correct behavior in all cases. Additionally, we can address potential issues related to floating-point precision by using numeric comparisons with tolerances and carefully handling edge cases.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander  # If either input is inf or NaN, return the default values

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmax, vmin = vmin, vmax  # Swap vmin and vmax if increasing is True and vmin is greater than vmax

    max_range = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))  # Find the maximum absolute value

    if max_range < tiny or abs(vmax - vmin) < max_range * tiny:  # Check for small intervals
        if vmax == vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmax, vmin = vmin, vmax  # Swap vmin and vmax back if increasing is False

    return vmin, vmax
```

By revising the logic for swapping and handling small intervals, we can ensure that the function works correctly across various input scenarios. With these modifications, the corrected function should pass all the given failing test cases and provide the expected results.
