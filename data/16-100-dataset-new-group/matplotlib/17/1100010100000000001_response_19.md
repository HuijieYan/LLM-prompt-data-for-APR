The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The function checks for `np.isfinite` for `vmin` and `vmax` and returns -expander and expander if either of them is not finite. However, it should also handle the case when both inputs are close to zero, in addition to handling the cases when either input is inf or NaN.
2. There is a logical error in the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. The function should use the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` for the comparison.
3. The logical operation of swapping `vmin` and `vmax` based on `increasing` may not be correct. This operation should be handled after the adjustments to `vmin` and `vmax` have been made.

The cause of the bug is a combination of not handling specific edge cases and an incorrect logical operation when swapping `vmin` and `vmax`. 

One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to:
1. Add a condition to handle the case when both inputs (`vmin` and `vmax`) are close to zero.
2. Modify the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to use the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin`.
3. Move the logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` to the end of the function so that it reflects the final state of the endpoints.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if np.isclose(vmin, 0) and np.isclose(vmax, 0):
        return -expander, expander

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
