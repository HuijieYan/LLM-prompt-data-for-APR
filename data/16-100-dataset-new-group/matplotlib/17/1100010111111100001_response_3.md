The issue seems to be related to the handling of extreme values for `vmin` and `vmax`, especially when they reach the limits of what can be expressed with a certain precision, causing overflow errors. In particular, when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small, it triggers warnings.

To address this issue, an additional condition is needed to check for these extreme values and handle them appropriately. Additionally, the function should explicitly convert input values to `float` to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax: float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander: float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny: float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints. If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded. This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise, the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing: bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax: float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -(*expander*), *expander*.
    """

    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if np.abs(vmax - vmin) < np.finfo(float).tiny:
        if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
            return -expander, expander

        vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)
    else:
        maxabsvalue = max(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))
        if maxabsvalue < 1e6 / tiny * np.finfo(float).tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

With these updates, the function should now handle extreme values and small intervals appropriately, preventing overflow errors and runtime warnings.
