The bug is caused by incorrect condition checks and incorrect calculation of the `maxabsvalue` variable. The function is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The bug is observed in the `maxabsvalue` calculation as it doesn't accurately represent the largest absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. Additionally, there are incorrect conditions to check the size of the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` and to handle swapping of values.

To fix the bug:
1. Correctly calculate the `maxabsvalue` as the largest absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.
2. Adjust the conditions to properly check the size of the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` and correctly handle swapping of values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander / 2
            vmax += expander / 2

    if (swapped and not increasing):
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
The above corrected function uses appropriate conditions for checking the interval size and properly swaps the values based on the `increasing` parameter. The `maxabsvalue` is now calculated as intended.

With this correction, the function should now produce the correct outputs and pass the failing tests.
