The `nonsingular` function seems to be failing with the given test function, and the corresponding error message suggests that there are overflows encountered due to the use of a scalar absolute function and scalar subtract.

The potential error locations within the function include the calculation of absolute values and the subtraction operation. The conditions provided in the if-elif statements might need to be revisited as well.

The cause of the bug is the potential overflow encountered due to the absolute function and scalar subtraction operation. In the context of the test function, the use of small values of `clim` seems to cause the overflow, leading to the failure of the test.

A strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing the conditions in the `nonsingular` function to prevent potential overflows due to the operations involved. Additionally, it may be necessary to revise the calculation of absolute values and subtraction to handle a broader range of input values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= tiny:  # Updated condition to prevent overflow
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)  # Updated subtraction operation
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)  # Updated addition operation

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The modifications to the `nonsingular` function involve updating the conditions to prevent overflows and revisiting the subtraction and addition operations to handle a wider range of input values.
