The buggy function `nonsingular` is encountering issues with values that are approaching the limits of floating-point precision, leading to overflow and runtime warnings.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle very small intervals between `vmin` and `vmax` correctly. For such intervals, the function should be expanding the range instead of performing arithmetic operations that may lead to numerical inaccuracies and overflows.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly adjust the endpoints of the range when the interval is too small and avoid integer overflow.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        return (vmin - expander, vmax + expander) if increasing else (vmax + expander, vmin - expander)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version should address the issue by properly handling the small intervals and avoiding overflows or numerical inaccuracies.
