The bug occurs due to a logical error in the condition checking for the interval size and for the case when both inputs are 0 or very close to 0. 

The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` does not cover all potential scenarios. For example, in Case 1, when both inputs are 0 and tiny is 1e-15, the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is True, leading to incorrect endpoints. 

To address the bug, we should remove the `elif` statement and instead check for the case when both inputs are 0 separately. Additionally, we should consider scenarios where both inputs are negative or positive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
        return -expander, expander

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    else:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) if vmin > 0 else -expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax) if vmax > 0 else -expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function addresses the bug by explicitly checking for the edge cases when both inputs are 0 and updating the intervals accordingly. Additionally, it adjusts the interval expansion based on the sign of the inputs.
