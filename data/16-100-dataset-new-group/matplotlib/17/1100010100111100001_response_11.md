The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the `RuntimeWarning` "overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "overflow encountered in scalar absolute". This indicates that there are calculations leading to overflow due to the very large absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

The potential cause of the bug is the check `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. If the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue * tiny`, calculations within that block can lead to overflow as seen in the error messages.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to a safer threshold.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    threshold = tiny * maxabsvalue
    if threshold < 100:
        threshold = 100  # Set a minimum threshold to avoid overflow
    if vmax - vmin <= threshold:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This modification includes setting a minimum threshold to avoid overflow when checking the difference between `vmax` and `vmin`. By setting a minimum threshold, we can prevent the calculations from leading to overflow for very large absolute values.
