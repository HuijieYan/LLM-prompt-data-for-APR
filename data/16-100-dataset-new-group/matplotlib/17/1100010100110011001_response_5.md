The issue occurs due to the possibility of overflow in the code. This is causing a RuntimeWarning when attempting to calculate the absolute value of the endpoint differences, which results in an overflow encountered in scalar subtract. The function fails to handle edge cases for small intervals or extreme input values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the case when the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small or when `vmin` is greater than `vmax`. This can be done by checking for these conditions and expanding the interval accordingly.

Below is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Swap vmin and vmax if increasing is False and vmin is greater than vmax
    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    # Calculate the absolute difference between vmin and vmax
    diff = vmax - vmin

    # If the difference is very small, expand the interval
    if diff <= tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    return vmin, vmax
```

The updated function now properly handles the edge cases for very small intervals and for when `vmin` is greater than `vmax`. This should address the overflow issues and provide the expected output for the given test cases.
