The cause of the bug in the `nonsingular` function is due to the scenario where `maxabsvalue` is calculated. When calculating `maxabsvalue`, it should be handled with more care to avoid a potential overflow issue or other insufficiencies. The error message clearly shows the problematic part of the code.

The issue is identified here:
```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
```
There is a potential overflow issue due to the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. It is causing a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute` or `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract`.

To fix the bug, a potential strategy would be to handle the calculation of `maxabsvalue` more robustly, so there's no potential for overflow. Additionally, the conditions for calculating `vmin` and `vmax` should also be handled with more care.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) <= np.finfo(float).tiny and abs(vmin) <= np.finfo(float).tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, I've used condition `abs(vmax - vmin)` as opposed to `vmax - vmin` directly to avoid the overflow issue. I've also modified the conditions to check for very small values of `vmin` and `vmax` separately rather than in a single condition.

After making these changes, the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should pass the failing test.
