The issue in the buggy function seems to be the conditional checks for "maxabsvalue" and the adjustment of "vmin" and "vmax" based on these checks. The conditional checks and adjustments may not be working as expected, leading to errors in the values of "vmin" and "vmax" based on the input values.

It seems that the function is trying to avoid singularities and make modifications to the endpoints if certain conditions are met. However, the logic used for these modifications is not ensuring the correct behavior under all scenarios.

To fix the bug, a strategy might be to reconsider the conditional checks and the endpoint adjustments. It's also important to ensure that the function behaves as expected for both positive and negative input values and extreme cases such as infinity or very large numbers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin
    epsilon = tiny * maxabsvalue
    
    if interval < epsilon:
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values.
