The buggy function has multiple potential error locations. The main problem lies in the conditional statements and the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. Specifically, the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` appears to be problematic.

The buggy function is not handling cases where either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very close to zero correctly, and not expanding the interval or swapping the vmin and vmax values as needed.

To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the conditions related to handling singularities such that they consider all possible edge cases thoroughly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == vmax == 0) or (abs(vmax - vmin) < tiny):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    elif vmax < vmin and not increasing:
        pass  # keep vmin, vmax as it is
    elif expander/vmax > tiny and expander/vmin > tiny:
        if vmax - vmin < tiny * max(abs(vmax), abs(vmin)):
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, I've added condition checks for handling cases where either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very close to zero, and where the vmin and vmax values need to be swapped. Additionally, I've modified the condition for expanding the interval to ensure it behaves as expected for cases where the interval is smaller than the given threshold.
