The bug in the `nonsingular` function is likely related to handling very large or very small values. The `RuntimeWarning` suggests that there might be an overflow occurring during scalar subtraction.

Based on the error messages and the runtime values, it seems that the `nonsingular` function is not handling the input values properly and causing an overflow, which results in a `RuntimeWarning` being raised.

One potential cause of the bug is the comparison `vmax - vmin` which might result in an overflow if `vmax` and `vmin` are very large integers or floats.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison and handling of large/small values in the `nonsingular` function to ensure that overflow does not occur.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander  # Return the expander values if input is inf or NaN

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin  # Swap vmin and vmax if necessary

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    # Adjust vmin and vmax based on the comparison with tiny
    if (vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny) or (np.isinf(maxabsvalue) and np.isfinite(vmin) and np.isfinite(vmax)):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander  # Return the expander values if both inputs are very close to zero
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)  # Swap vmin and vmax if necessary

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected version, the `RuntimeWarning` should no longer occur when running the failing tests.
