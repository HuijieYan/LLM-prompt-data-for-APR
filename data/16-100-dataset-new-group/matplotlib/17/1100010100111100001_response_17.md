Looking at the runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy function, we can identify a potential issue. The `maxabsvalue` variable is computed as the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`. However, when `vmin` and `vmax` are of type `int16`, converting them to `float` and then taking the absolute value can result in unexpected behaviors due to potential overflow.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are of type `int16` separately and perform the absolute value calculation before the conversion to `float`. We can then use the corrected values to calculate `maxabsvalue`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if isinstance(vmin, np.int16):
        vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the potential overflow issue when `vmin` and `vmax` are of type `int16` and should pass the failing test cases.
