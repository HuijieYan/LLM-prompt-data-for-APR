The cause of the bug is that the `maxabsvalue` is being calculated using the `max` function instead of using `max` to compare `vmin` and `vmax` separately to only get the maximum absolute value between the two. Additionally, there is an issue with the `tiny` parameter in the comparison. It should check if the interval is smaller than `tiny`, rather than comparing the `vmax - vmin` with `maxabsvalue * tiny`. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the calculation for `maxabsvalue` and the comparison with `tiny`. We also need to ensure that if `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped, the value of `maxabsvalue` is recalculated using the updated values.

Below is the corrected version of the function based on the identified issues:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded. This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if swapped:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))  # Recalculate maxabsvalue if vmin and vmax are swapped

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:  # Compare with `tiny` directly, not `maxabsvalue * tiny`
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
