The bug in the provided `nonsingular` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when both `vmin` and `vmax` are negative. In this case, the function does not properly adjust the endpoints to avoid singularities.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to add a conditional check before modifying the endpoints when both `vmin` and `vmax` are negative.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == -vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the `nonsingular` function should now correctly handle the case when both `vmin` and `vmax` are negative, and should pass the failing test provided.
