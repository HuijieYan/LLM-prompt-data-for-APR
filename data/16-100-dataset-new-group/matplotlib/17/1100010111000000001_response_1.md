The issue with the `nonsingular` function is that it fails to handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to each other and both are very close to zero. This leads to incorrect expansion of the endpoints, causing the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `nonsingular` function to handle the scenario where both inputs are zero or very close to zero.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmin) <= tiny and abs(vmax) <= tiny:  # handle the case where both inputs are very close to zero
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By including a check for the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
