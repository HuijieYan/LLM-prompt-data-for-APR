The bug identified in the `nonsingular` function is that it does not correctly handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are of the same value, leading to incorrect expansion. This was identified based on the behavior observed in Case 3, where `vmin` and `vmax` were both 0.

To fix the bug, we need to explicitly handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are equal at the beginning of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    ... (parameters and returns are same as before)
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin == vmax:
        return vmin - expander, vmax + expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected version of the function includes a check to handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are equal at the beginning. If they are equal, the function returns the expanded values.

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should now pass the failing test cases.
