Looking at the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue might be related to the `maxabsvalue` variable's calculation and use. The goal of the `nonsingular` function is to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities, and the `maxabsvalue` is used for making certain adjustments to the `vmin` and `vmax`.

Given the cases provided, it's clear that the calculation and usage of `maxabsvalue`, along with the conditional blocks depending on it, might be causing the failures in the tests. Also, the way the vmin and vmax are expanded based on the `expander` variable seems to be causing unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we should focus on ensuring that the `maxabsvalue` is calculated accurately and used appropriately to make decisions about adjusting the endpoints (`vmin` and `vmax`).

Here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    diff = vmax - vmin
    if diff <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if not np.isclose(vmax, 0) or not np.isclose(vmin, 0):
            adjust = expander * abs(vmax)
            vmin -= adjust
            vmax += adjust
        else:
            return -expander, expander

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, the calculations related to `maxabsvalue` and the adjustments to `vmin` and `vmax` have been revised in order to address the issues observed during the test executions. It includes proper handling of edge cases and adjustments based on the input values.
