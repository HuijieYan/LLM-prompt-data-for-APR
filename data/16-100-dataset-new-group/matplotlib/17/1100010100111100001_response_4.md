The issue is likely caused by arithmetic operations outside the bounds of the expected types and values. The error message indicates that an overflow was encountered in scalar subtract and scalar absolute operations. The specific input and output types in the cases indicate that there might be a discrepancy in the types of the variables being handled in the arithmetic operations.

To resolve the issue:
1. Ensure that all arithmetic operations and comparisons are consistent with the types of the input parameters.
2. Prioritize handling the edge cases such as infinities, NaN, and very small numbers to avoid arithmetic issues.

Based on the analysis, a corrected version of the function is provided below.

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not (np.isfinite(vmin) and np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmax - vmin <= np.finfo(float).tiny):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        vmin -= expander * maxabsvalue
        vmax += expander * maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version ensures that the arithmetic operations are handled appropriately for the given input types and values, and that edge cases are properly dealt with according to the requirements specified in the function's docstring.
