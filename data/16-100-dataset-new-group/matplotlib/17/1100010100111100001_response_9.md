The cause of the bugs is that the function `nonsingular` is not handling negative values for `vmin` and `vmax` correctly. 

Specifically, in the `nonsingular` function, the case where `vmax - vmin` is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue * tiny` is being calculated incorrectly due to the conversion to float from int16. Additionally, the initial check for non-finite values does not correctly handle the negation of int16 data type.

To fix this bug, we will ensure that the input parameters are converted from int16 to float at the start of the function. We will also perform float operations throughout the function in order to correctly handle the calculations for the modified endpoints.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    vmin = float(vmin)  # Convert to float
    vmax = float(vmax)
    
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these changes, the function should now handle negative values for `vmin` and `vmax` correctly and the failing tests should pass.
