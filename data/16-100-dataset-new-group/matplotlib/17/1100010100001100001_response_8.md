The function `nonsingular` has several conditional statements that may not be handling the edge cases correctly. After analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it seems that the conditional statements dealing with vmin and vmax might be causing the issues.

Based on the runtime values provided, as well as the expected outputs, it seems that the conditional statements handling the edge cases are not correctly modifying the endpoints of the range as needed.

For the most part, the bug seems to be caused by the way the function attempts to handle very small intervals and the swapping of vmin and vmax. A potential solution for fixing the bug would be to reevaluate how the function checks for the size of the interval and how it swaps the values based on the `increasing` parameter.

Here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0) or (abs(vmax - vmin) < max(abs(vmax), abs(vmin)) * tiny):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin - expander * abs(vmin), vmax + expander * abs(vmax)
```

In this corrected version, the function checks for the same conditions as before but modifies vmin and vmax based on these conditions to handle the edge cases more effectively.
