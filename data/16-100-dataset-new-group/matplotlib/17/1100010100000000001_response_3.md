The buggy function appears to be a mathematical function that takes in two float parameters, vmin and vmax, and checks for singularities. The function aims to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities, and returns the modified vmin and vmax.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition for checking whether vmin or vmax is not finite.
2. The condition for checking if maxabsvalue is less than a specified threshold.
3. The condition for checking if vmax - vmin is less than a specified threshold.

The bug in the function is that it does not handle the case where both vmin and vmax are very close to zero or both are zero, and it returns the default values of -expander and expander irrespective of the input values.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Add a condition to handle the case where both vmin and vmax are very close to zero or both are zero.
2. Adjust the conditions for checking the range, maxabsvalue, and threshold to ensure correct behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if abs(vmin) < tiny and abs(vmax) < tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, a check has been added to handle the case where both vmin and vmax are very close to zero or both are zero, and the conditions for handling the range, maxabsvalue, and threshold have been adjusted to ensure correct behavior.
