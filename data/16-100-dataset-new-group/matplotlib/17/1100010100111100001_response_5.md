The issue arises from the `maxabsvalue` variable being calculated incorrectly. The function is designed to avoid singularities by modifying the endpoints of a range as needed, and to do so, it calculates the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. However, the calculation for `maxabsvalue` is incorrect as described by the failing tests and the runtime input/output values provided. The variable `maxabsvalue` is set to the absolute value of either `vmin` or `vmax`, instead of their maximum absolute value. This causes the function to not appropriately detect the need for expansion and avoid a singularity, leading to the error messages regarding overflow and scalar absolute.

To fix the bug, the `maxabsvalue` calculation should be updated to find the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. This can be done using the `max` function with the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` as arguments.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain the same)

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))  # Updated calculation to find the maximum absolute value

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify the need for expansion and avoid singularities, resolving the error messages and ensuring the function passes the failing tests.
