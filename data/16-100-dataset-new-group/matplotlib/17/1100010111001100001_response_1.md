There is a bug in the `nonsingular` function where the range of the interval might not be correctly expanded to avoid singularities. Based on the failing test, it looks like the function fails to correctly handle some specific input values, especially in cases where the interval is very small or where the input values are at the limits of their data types. 

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the comparisons between `vmin`, `vmax` and the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. Specifically, in cases where the interval is very small or close to the resolution limit, the current function does not correctly handle the expansion of the interval. 

To fix the bug, we can refactor the function to handle the expansion of the interval more carefully, especially in cases where the interval is very small or where the inputs are at the limits of their data types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    small_interval = max(vmax - vmin, tiny)
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if small_interval / maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if (vmin > vmax) and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should handle the edge cases better and pass the failing test case.
