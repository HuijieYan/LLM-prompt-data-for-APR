To fix the bug, we need to address the `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute` warnings by specifically handling cases when there is potential for overflow.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the parts where arithmetic operations might lead to an overflow, specifically during the comparison:
1. `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`
2. `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`

The cause of the bug is that the comparison `vmax - vmin` might cause an overflow, leading to the warning `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract`. Similarly, when finding the `maxabsvalue` by taking the maximum of the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, the calculation might cause an overflow, resulting in the warning `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`.

To fix the bug, we need to check for potential overflow situations and handle them to avoid the warnings.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax) - abs(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the potential overflow situations by adjusting the condition for comparison and ensuring that the calculated values do not lead to overflow. This version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
