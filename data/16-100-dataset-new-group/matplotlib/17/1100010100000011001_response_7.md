The buggy function appears to be modifying the endpoints of a range if the original interval is too small, based on a given threshold. However, there seem to be errors in the logic that checks for singularities and modifies the endpoints.

In the buggy function, the error locations are likely to be in the logic that checks if the interval is too small and in the logic that swaps the vmin and vmax if increasing is False.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the logic for expanding the interval if it is too small may not be working as intended, leading to incorrect endpoint modifications.

To fix the bug, one strategy would be to review and revise the logic for expanding the interval based on the threshold and also check if the logic for swapping the vmin and vmax is correctly implemented.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if not increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if vmax - vmin < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expansion = expander * maxabsvalue
            vmin -= expansion
            vmax += expansion

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
