The issue with the `nonsingular` function is that it mistakenly calculates the `maxabsvalue` and it has inconsistent data types.

The bug is caused because the line `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` wrongly assumes that `abs` produces a float value. But that is not the case, as the output is determined by the input, and in many instances feet can be integer input.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `maxabsvalue` is of type `float` and then convert the outputs of `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)` to floats, given their type at that point.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as the buggy function)

    Returns
    -------
    ... (same as the buggy function)
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = float(max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif float(vmax) - float(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return float(vmin), float(vmax)
```

With these changes, the `nonsingular` function should now correctly handle different input cases and pass the failing tests.
