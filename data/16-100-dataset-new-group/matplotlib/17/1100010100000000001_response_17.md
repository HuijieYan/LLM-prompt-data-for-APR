The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic for handling very small intervals and singularities.
2. The logic for handling infinite or NaN inputs may not be correct.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where `vmax` and `vmin` are both 0 or very close to zero. When the interval is smaller than a threshold value (defined by `tiny`), it should be expanded to avoid singularities.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling very small intervals and singularities needs to be updated to correctly handle the case where both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        if not increasing:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the function checks if both `vmin` and `vmax` are very small and handles the case where they are both close to zero by expanding the interval to avoid singularities. Additionally, the logic for handling the swap of `vmin` and `vmax` is updated to consider the `increasing` parameter.
