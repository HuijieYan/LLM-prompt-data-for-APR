The bug in the `nonsingular` function is likely due to incorrect logic and threshold conditions. Based on the analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values, the following issues have been identified:

1. The condition to check for singularities is incorrect and does not handle infinities and very large or very small numbers properly.
2. The function has errors in handling swapped values that are not resolved correctly.

To fix the bug:
- Add proper checks for positive and negative infinity.
- Correct the logic to handle swapped values and how the expander should be added to the endpoints.
- Use correct, consistent logic and threshold conditions to determine whether to return the original values or adjusted values within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

        # check for singularity due to very small interval
        if abs(vmax - vmin) <= (tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))):
            if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    else:  # case when increasing is False
        if vmax > vmin:  # swap if necessary
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

        # check for singularity due to very small interval
        if abs(vmax - vmin) <= (tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))):
            if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected function now handles infinities, singularity checks, and swapping of values properly based on the `increasing` parameter and also uses correct logic and threshold conditions to determine the adjustments to be made to the input values.
