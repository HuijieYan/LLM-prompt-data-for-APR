The issue with the `nonsingular` function is likely related to the comparison of floating-point values and the handling of extremely small numbers. The error messages indicate a "overflow encountered" and "overflow encountered in scalar subtract", which suggests that there is an issue with the size of the values being compared or manipulated.

To fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function, we need to ensure that the comparison and manipulation of floating-point values is performed correctly and does not lead to overflow issues. We can do this by updating the logic for expanding the interval when it is too small and checking for the presence of infinities or NaN in the input.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function that should address the issues:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    # Check for infinite or NaN input
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    # Ensure vmin is less than or equal to vmax
    if vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
        
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue * tiny < np.finfo(float).tiny:
        # Scale vmin and vmax by expander
        vmin = vmin - expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax = vmax + expander * abs(vmax)
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        # Handle case of very small interval
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        # Swap vmin and vmax if not increasing order
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the logic for handling extremely small intervals and ensuring proper comparison of the input values, this version of the function should prevent the overflow issues and return correct expanded and/or swapped endpoints as necessary.
