The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the condition checks and the assignments inside the conditions. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the cases where the input endpoints (vmin, vmax) are close to zero or are not finite (inf or NaN). Therefore, the function is not correctly modifying the endpoints to avoid singularities.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to first check if the input values are finite, and if not, return the modified endpoints `-expander`, `expander`. Then, check if both inputs are 0 or very close to zero, and modify them accordingly. Additionally, swap the endpoints if necessary based on the `increasing` parameter, and perform the required expansions to avoid singularities.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
