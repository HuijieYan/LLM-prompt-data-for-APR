The bug in the given function is causing incorrect behavior when modifying the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The buggy function is not properly expanding the input endpoints when the interval is too small, and it is not swapping the endpoints when the input `increasing` parameter is False.

The potential error locations in the buggy function include:
1. The condition for checking if the interval is too small and needs to be expanded.
2. The condition for swapping the endpoints when `increasing` is False.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the cases where the input interval is very small and needs to be expanded, and it does not correctly swap the endpoints when the `increasing` parameter is False.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated with the correct conditions and logic for expanding the interval and swapping the endpoints based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if vmax - vmin <= tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)):
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the function properly handles the cases where the interval is too small and where the endpoints need to be swapped. Additionally, unnecessary conditions and operations have been removed to simplify the logic.
