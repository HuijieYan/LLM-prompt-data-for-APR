The `nonsingular` function should handle the `clim` values that caused the failing test. The failing test provides specific values for `clim`, which are as follows:
1. (-20000, 20000)
2. (-32768, 0)

The buggy code in the `nonsingular` function appears to have issues related to the threshold values and endpoints.

To fix this bug, we can adjust the condition checks and the adjustments made to `vmin` and `vmax` to ensure that they handle extreme values like those in the failing tests without causing issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if interval < tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander
    elif (maxabsvalue < tiny):
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected version, the failing test cases should now pass.
