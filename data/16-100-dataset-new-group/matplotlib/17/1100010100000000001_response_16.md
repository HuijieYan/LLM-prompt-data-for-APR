The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. In the portion of code that calculates `maxabsvalue`, it is using the `np.finfo(float).tiny` which may not provide the expected result.
2. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` does not seem to be correct.
3. The condition for checking if `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` and modifying `vmin` and `vmax` accordingly is not accurate.

The cause of the bug in the function is due to incorrect conditions and calculations leading to incorrect modifications to `vmin` and `vmax`, especially when the interval is too small or close to zero.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to re-evaluate the conditions and calculations for modifying the endpoints of the range to avoid singularities, particularly focusing on the ratios and comparisons involved.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or ((vmin == 0) and (vmax == 0)) or (abs(vmin - vmax) < tiny):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
