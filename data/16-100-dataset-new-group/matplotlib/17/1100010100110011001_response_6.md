The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to how it handles very large or very small values, leading to potential overflow warnings. From the error messages, it seems that the `maxabsvalue` variable could be the issue as it triggers overflow warnings. Additionally, the behavior of swapping `vmin` and `vmax` when `vmin` > `vmax` may not be working as expected, as it also reports a bug. 

The strategy for fixing the bug should involve updating the handling of extremely large or small values and ensuring that the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` is correctly handled without leading to overflow warnings.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This should solve the overflow warnings and address the swapping issue.
