The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to the calculation and comparison logic when handling the input values. 

In particular, the following observations from the cases provided indicate potential issues:
1. When the `vmin` and `vmax` values are both very close to zero or exactly zero, the function should return `expander` and `-expander` respectively, but it doesn't behave as expected.
2. The comparisons using the `maxabsvalue` variable in relation to `tiny` and the expression `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` might be insufficient to handle very small intervals properly.
3. There is existing logic to swap `vmin` and `vmax` if `vmax` is less than `vmin` (not considering the `increasing` flag), followed by additional checks and modifications, which could potentially lead to unexpected updates of the `vmin` and `vmax` values.
4. The cast of the `vmin` and `vmax` inputs to float types in some cases might lead to unexpected behavior, as the resulting float type might not fully represent the original inputs.

To fix this, we can modify the function to consistently handle the input values and the edge cases involving very small intervals, along with adjusting the swapping logic based on the `increasing` flag and avoiding unnecessary updates of `vmin` and `vmax`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    elif vmin < vmax and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax - vmin < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This revised function addresses the identified issues by explicitly checking and returning the output values for the edge cases, properly handling the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` flag, and ensuring the interval expansion logic works as intended.
