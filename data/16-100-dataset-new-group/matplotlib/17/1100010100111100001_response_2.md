The bug in the `nonsingular` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of `vmin` and `vmax` with respect to `maxabsvalue`. When the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are related to the `tiny` threshold, the comparison should be made with the absolute difference rather than the subtraction. This causes an overflow and a runtime warning to occur.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison of `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` by taking the absolute difference of `vmax` and `vmin`.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function, the failing tests should be resolved.
