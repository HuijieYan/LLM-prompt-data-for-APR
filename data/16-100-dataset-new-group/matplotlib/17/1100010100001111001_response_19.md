The bug in the `nonsingular` function appears to be in the conditional statements that modify `vmin` and `vmax` based on their values and the values of `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`. The bug is causing the function to return incorrect `vmin` and `vmax` values for several test cases.

The bug seems to be due to inconsistencies in converting types and potential precision errors when comparing float values. The use of `int` for values could also lead to undesirable behavior.

A strategy to fix the bug can involve ensuring that all comparisons and type conversions are consistent and do not introduce precision issues due to float operations. Additionally, special cases such as infinities and tiny values should be handled appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrections made include using the `np.isfinite` function and `np.isclose` function to handle the special cases of infinite, NaN, and very close to zero values. Additionally, float values are compared using `np.isclose` to avoid precision issues.
