The bug is caused by the use of absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` without considering the potential for overflow when the values are very large. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are within the threshold specified by `tiny` but not exactly equal to zero, leading to a false condition for expansion.

To fix these issues, the function needs to be adjusted to properly handle large values and to correctly expand the interval when it is close to zero within the specified threshold.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < np.finfo(float).max / (1e6 / tiny):
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny and maxabsvalue > 0:
        vmin -= expander*maxabsvalue
        vmax += expander*maxabsvalue

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the potential overflow issue by using `np.finfo(float).max` to handle very large values, and properly expands the interval when it is within the specified threshold but not exactly zero. This fix ensures that the function behaves correctly for large inputs and when the interval is close to zero.
