The issue is being caused by overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and absolute function. The values of `vmin` and `vmax` must be large, resulting in an overflow in computations due to the absolute and scalar subtraction operations.

To fix this issue, we need to reconsider the way we handle max absolute value and adjust the expander and tiny values to avoid potential overflows during calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-6, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By adjusting the `tiny` value from `1e-15` to `1e-6` and slightly increasing the default `expander` value to `0.001`, we ensure that absolute values and calculations do not lead to overflows or precision issues. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
