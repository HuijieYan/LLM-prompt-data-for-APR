The buggy function's logic is attempting to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities. However, there are potential error locations in the code that need to be fixed.

1. In the first condition, if either `vmin` or `vmax` are not finite, the function should return `-expander, expander`. But it is not checking for the case where both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.
2. In the second condition, the calculation for `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent comparison with `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` might not give the desired result due to float comparison issues.
3. In the third condition, if `vmax - vmin` is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue * tiny`, the condition `vmax == 0 and vmin == 0` seems redundant and can be simplified.
4. The logic to handle swapped endpoints and the `increasing` parameter seems to be incorrect.

To fix these issues, we can simplify the logic and ensure that the conditions are properly checked.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/transforms.py

# this is the corrected function
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values.
