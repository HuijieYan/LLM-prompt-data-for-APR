The potential error locations within the buggy function are: 
1. The condition checking if `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` may be causing an overflow error when calculating `vmax - vmin`.
2. The `maxabsvalue` calculation in the next line might raise a warning.

The cause of the bug is that the function `nonsingular` can encounter overflow and runtime warnings when calculating the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` and when taking the absolute value of those variables. This is indicated by the corresponding error messages, which also indicate that runtime warnings are occurring during these operations.

To fix the bug, we can introduce checks for the possibility of overflow and handle them gracefully.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    try:
        condition = (vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny)
    except OverflowError:
        condition = True
    
    if condition:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With the provided fix, the corrected version introduces a try-except block to handle any potential overflow errors when calculating the condition. Additionally, the condition checking for the interval size has been modified to handle the possible overflow situation. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
