The issue seems to be related to floating point precision and overflow encountered in some arithmetic operations, leading to incorrect results and generating RuntimeWarnings. Specifically, the error messages indicate "overflow encountered" and "overflow encountered in scalar subtract".

One potential fix could be to introduce additional checks to handle edge cases and avoid overflow, such as limiting the maximum absolute value used in comparisons or directly checking if an operation can possibly lead to overflow. Additionally, using consistent floating point types and explicitly casting input variables to the correct type can help prevent unexpected results due to implicit type conversions.

Given the analysis, the corrected version of the function could be implemented as follows:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Ensure consistent types: cast to float if not already float
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    # Additional checks to avoid overflow and handle edge cases
    if maxabsvalue == 0 or (vmax - vmin <= 0 and maxabsvalue * tiny <= 1):
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            vmin = max(vmin - expander * abs(vmin), -expander)
            vmax = min(vmax + expander * abs(vmax), expander)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle edge cases and avoid overflow issues, resolving the failing tests.
