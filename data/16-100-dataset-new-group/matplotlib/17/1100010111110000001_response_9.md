The provided code for the function `nonsingular` is intended to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities. The maxabsvalue variable is calculated using the `max` function, which may lead to negative values for `vmin` and `vmax`, resulting in runtime warnings related to overflow.

The cause of the bug is that when the `maxabsvalue` is calculated using the `max` function, and the `vmin` and `vmax` passed to the function are negative, it results in a `RuntimeWarning` for overflow. This occurs when trying to calculate the `max` of negative values with the `abs` function.

To fix this bug, we can update the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to ensure that it is always positive.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

The updated `nonsingular` function ensures that the `maxabsvalue` is calculated as the maximum of the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. This avoids negative values in `maxabsvalue` and resolves the runtime warnings related to the overflow.

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test without producing any runtime warnings.
