The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to the calculation of the `maxabsvalue` in the `elif` block of the function. This calculation is leading to a potential overflow during the runtime. To address this issue, the calculation for `maxabsvalue` needs to be simplified in order to prevent the overflow from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    # Calculate the interval
    interval = abs(vmax - vmin)

    if interval < tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    else:
        # If the interval is large enough, no need to modify the endpoints
        pass

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version simplifies the calculation by directly calculating the interval (abs(vmax - vmin)) and using it to adjust the endpoints if needed. This change ensures that the `maxabsvalue` calculation no longer leads to potential overflows, thereby addressing the issue identified.
