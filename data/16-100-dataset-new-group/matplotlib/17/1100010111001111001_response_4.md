The issue appears to be related to the swapping of vmin and vmax if vmin > vmax. Also, there are some issues with the logic used to expand the interval when it's too small. Additionally, the buggy function does not properly handle cases where the input parameters are inf or NaN.

Here's the corrected version of the function which should pass the failing test cases:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if abs(vmax - vmin) <= abs(max(vmin, vmax)) * tiny:
        vmin -= expander / 2
        vmax += expander / 2

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected function now handles cases where the input parameters are inf, NaN, or 0, as well as properly expands the interval when it's too small. The condition for swapping vmin and vmax has been updated and the float division is used to expand the interval.
