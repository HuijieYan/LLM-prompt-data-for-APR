The bug in the `nonsingular` function is most likely associated with how the function handles singularities and how the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` are modified to avoid singularities. The bug may be due to the incorrect handling of edge cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero or are infinite.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `nonsingular` function to correctly handle the cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero, infinite, or where the interval is very small.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif vmax < vmin and not increasing:
        # do not swap, let vmin and vmax as is
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
In the corrected version:
- The condition for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` has been fixed to properly handle the case when `vmax` is less than `vmin`.
- A new conditional check has been added to handle cases where the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` is smaller than the `tiny` threshold.
- The condition for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` when not using increasing ordering has been added.

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should now pass the failing test.
