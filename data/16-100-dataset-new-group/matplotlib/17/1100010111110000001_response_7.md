The bug in the `nonsingular` function is causing a `RuntimeWarning` for overflow encountered in scalar subtract or scalar absolute. The bug is likely related to the excessive use of small or large values in the function inside the `if` block.

The cause of the bug is that the algorithm is running into a numeric overflow for some input values due to the comparison in the function. Since the `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, the bug is likely related to the logic for expanding the range when the difference between the endpoints is too small.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve debugging the condition that checks for small interval sizes and revisiting the logic to adjust the endpoints. Additionally, the use of `expander` and `tiny` values to control the expansion should be examined to ensure that they are scaling the range correctly. Furthermore, any comparisons or calculations that could lead to numeric overflows or underflows should be addressed.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax:
        if not increasing:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        else:
            swapped = True

    interval_size = abs(vmax - vmin)
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if interval_size < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This updated `nonsingular` function addresses the comparisons and arithmetic that were vulnerable to numeric underflows or overflows. It also simplifies the logic for interval expansion and endpoint processing to ensure that the new endpoints are correctly adjusted and that no numeric instability occurs.
