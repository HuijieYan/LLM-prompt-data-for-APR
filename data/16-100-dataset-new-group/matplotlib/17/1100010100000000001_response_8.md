The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. The comparison of the interval to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints might not be accurate.
2. The condition for checking if the interval is smaller than the threshold might be inaccurate.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case when the interval is too small. The function is not properly detecting and expanding the interval when it's smaller than the threshold `tiny`.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to explicitly compare the interval size with the threshold and expand the interval as needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if interval < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        vmin = (vmin - expander) if vmin < 0 else (vmin + expander)
        vmax = (vmax - expander) if vmax < 0 else (vmax + expander)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the interval size is explicitly calculated as `vmax - vmin`, and then compared with `tiny * maxabsvalue` to determine if the interval should be expanded. The math operation for expanding the interval has also been corrected.
