The bug occurs when the values of vmin and vmax are equal. The code doesn't handle this case well and it leads to incorrect expansion. Additionally, the comparison with np.finfo(float).tiny is susceptible to machine precision issues and could lead to unnecessary range expansion in some extreme cases.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin == vmax:  # handle case when vmin and vmax are equal
        return vmin - expander, vmax + expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:  # swap vmin and vmax if necessary
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin

    if interval < maxabsvalue * tiny:  # adjust interval size based on tiny and expander
        vmin -= expander * maxabsvalue
        vmax += expander * maxabsvalue

    return vmin, vmax
```

By handling the cases when vmin and vmax are equal separately and by adjusting the interval size based on the tiny and expander values, the function should now work correctly for all cases.
