After analyzing the error messages, failing tests, and input/output variable values, it is apparent that the bug in the `nonsingular` function causes potential errors when the interval is very small, very large, or contains infinite values. The error message indicates overflow issues and warnings related to scalar subtraction and absolute value computation. 

The bug causes a problem with the singularity check and the interval expansion logic. The function needs to be fixed to handle the extreme cases of input values correctly.

To fix this bug, one possible strategy is to modify the condition for checking when the interval is smaller than the threshold and extend the interval accordingly. A safer and more effective approach would be to refactor the entire singularity check and interval expansion logic to be more robust and avoid potential scalar and overflow issues. 

Additionally, the function should handle special cases like infinities and NaNs more explicitly.

Below is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        interval = vmax - vmin
        if interval <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of `nonsingular` function has been refactored with the updated logic to handle singularities and avoid potential runtime issues. It also properly checks for special cases to return the expected output.

The refactored function uses a more robust approach and explicitly handles singularity checks and interval expansion logic, addressing the issues identified in the failing test cases and error messages.
