The potential error locations within the `nonsingular` function are as follows:
1. Error in handling the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero or zero itself.
2. Error in the condition for expanding the interval if it's too small based on the `tiny` threshold.
3. Error in swapping `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` parameter.

Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from incorrect logic to handle cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are zero or very close to zero, the condition for expanding the interval based on the `tiny` threshold, and the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` parameter.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition for handling cases where both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero or zero itself.
2. Revise the condition for expanding the interval based on the `tiny` threshold.
3. Update the swapping logic for `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as before)

    Returns
    -------
    ... (same as before)
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        if abs(vmax) < tiny:
            vmax = expander
        if abs(vmin) < tiny:
            vmin = -expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
