The potential error locations within the given function `nonsingular` are as follows:

1. The first potential error is with the comparison of `vmax < vmin` to swap the values of vmin and vmax. If both `vmin` and `vmax` are not finite, the function should return `-expander, expander`. 

2. The next potential error is with the comparison of `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` and the subsequent assignment of `vmin` and `vmax`. It should check if the interval is smaller than the `tiny` value and then expand it by the `expander`.

The main cause of the bug is the incorrect evaluation and handling of the vmin and vmax values, and improper handling of intervals that are smaller than the tiny value.

A strategy for fixing the bugs in the function could be to:
- Add a check at the beginning of the function to handle the case when either `vmin` or `vmax` are not finite, and return `-expander, expander`.
- Update the logic to correctly compare the interval with the `tiny` value and expand it by `expander` if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if interval < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        vmin = vmin - expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax = vmax + expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
