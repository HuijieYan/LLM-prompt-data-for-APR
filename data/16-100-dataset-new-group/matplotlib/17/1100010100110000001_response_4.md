The issue is occurring due to potential overflowing during scalar subtract and scalar absolute operations. This means the difference of `vmax` and `vmin` may result in overflow or the absolute value of `vmin` or `vmax` may result in overflow when using the `np.int16` format.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `nonsingular` in the `transforms.py` file. The primary fix should focus on ensuring that there is no overflow during the operations.

Specifically, we should consider casting `vmin` and `vmax` from `np.int16` format to `float` before applying the operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Cast to float to avoid potential overflow in scalar operations
    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version casts `vmin` and `vmax` to `float` early in the function to avoid any potential overflow during the operations.

The corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should now pass the failing test.
