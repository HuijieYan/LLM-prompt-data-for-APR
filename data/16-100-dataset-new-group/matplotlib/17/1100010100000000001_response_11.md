Potential issues with the buggy function:
1. The function depends on a threshold value of `tiny` that might be too small and result in an extremely small interval, which will lead to an incorrect calculation.
2. The logic that swaps the `vmin` and `vmax` might not work correctly in some cases.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function could return incorrect results when the interval is extremely small, and there is an issue with the logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling small intervals, especially when the threshold value of `tiny` is too small. Additionally, we need to ensure that the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` is performed correctly in all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or np.isinf(vmin) or np.isinf(vmax) or (vmin == 0.0 and vmax == 0.0) or (abs(vmin) < tiny and abs(vmax) < tiny):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version of the function, we've updated the condition for checking `tiny` and the logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` to ensure that the function works correctly for all cases and intervals.
