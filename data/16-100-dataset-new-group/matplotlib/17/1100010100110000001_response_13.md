The bug identified here is associated with numerical precision and warnings related to overflow scenarios when calculating the absolute difference and absolute values. Specifically, the error message states that "overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "overflow encountered in scalar absolute" warnings are raised when the function is called.

In the given code, the issue seems to be arising from the conditional statements that check for specific conditions related to the input variables. The program should be carefully modified to eliminate any abrupt changes or potential errors that may arise from the use of absolute values and floating-point arithmetic.

One approach to resolving this issue is to ensure that the conditional checks are appropriate and that the procedures for handling the inputs are well-defined without encountering overflow issues. Additionally, it may be beneficial to modify the conditional checks in order to avoid the scenarios that lead to the warnings.

Here's a corrected version of the "nonsingular" function after addressing the identified issues:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        if increasing:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        else:
            pass
    else:
        if vmax - vmin <= max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks are redefined to avoid the overflow conditions that caused the warning messages. Additionally, the program now respects the increasing flag to swap the endpoints if necessary.

With these changes, the call to the `nonsingular` function should not raise any warnings related to overflow encountering in scalar operations.
