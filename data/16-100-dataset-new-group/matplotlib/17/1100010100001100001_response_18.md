The bug seems to arise in cases where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue * tiny`. The specific cause could be that the condition for this situation is not being correctly handled, as the logic that's supposed to address this scenario does not seem to be functioning properly.

A potential fix could involve refining the condition or changing the way it is handled. Specifically, it may be helpful to re-evaluate the handling of the `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` condition within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expander_value = expander * maxabsvalue
            vmin -= expander_value
            vmax += expander_value

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these changes, the function should handle small intervals correctly and provide the expected outputs for the given inputs.
