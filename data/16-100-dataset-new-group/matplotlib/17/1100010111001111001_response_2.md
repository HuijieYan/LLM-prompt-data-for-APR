The issue with the current implementation of the `nonsingular` function seems to be the condition to check if either input is infinite or NaN. In the provided runtime input/output variable values, it is observed that the expected output values are not being returned correctly for the boundary cases. Additionally, there are potential issues with the comparison of the interval size with very small values.

To improve the reliability and correctness of the `nonsingular` function, suggest a few changes:
1. Instead of manual comparisons and calculations, it is recommended to utilize the numpy functions to handle these outlier cases.
2. Remove the manual swap of vmin and vmax. This can be handled more elegantly using numpy functions.
3. Adjust the conditional checks for boundary cases to ensure proper handling.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite([vmin, vmax]).all():
        return np.array([-expander, expander])
    if increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)
    if np.isclose(vmin, vmax, rtol=0, atol=max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) * tiny):
        return vmin - expander, vmax + expander
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version uses numpy functions to handle floating-point comparisons and eliminates the manual swapping of vmin and vmax. It should address the issues mentioned and provide the expected output for the provided test cases.
