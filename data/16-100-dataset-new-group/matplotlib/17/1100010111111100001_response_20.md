The issue with the `nonsingular` function is that it does not handle large absolute values appropriately, leading to runtime warnings. The function is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities and to swap them if necessary based on the provided parameters.

Based on the failing test cases and the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it can be observed that the `maxabsvalue` calculation in the `nonsingular` function is not accounting for the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `maxabsvalue` is correctly calculated based on the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` in order to avoid the overflow warnings.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))  # Corrected calculation of maxabsvalue

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * maxabsvalue
            vmax += expander * maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the `nonsingular` function should now handle large absolute values appropriately and avoid the overflow encountered during the failing tests.
