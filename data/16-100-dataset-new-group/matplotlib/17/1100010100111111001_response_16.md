The bug in the `nonsingular` function is a potential overflow error caused by the floating-point precision limits. This occurs when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than the maximum absolute value times a very small value (controlled by the `tiny` parameter). The bug then applies an expansion to the endpoints that can lead to an overflow. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `elif` block in the `nonsingular` function to perform the expansion in a way that avoids the potential overflow error. 

Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        expansion = maxabsvalue * expander
        midpoint = (vmax + vmin) / 2.0
        vmin = midpoint - expansion
        vmax = midpoint + expansion

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function addresses the potential overflow error by calculating an expansion based on the midpoint of the range, rather than adding to or subtracting from the endpoints directly. This reduces the likelihood of overflow while achieving the intended goal of avoiding singularities in the input range.
