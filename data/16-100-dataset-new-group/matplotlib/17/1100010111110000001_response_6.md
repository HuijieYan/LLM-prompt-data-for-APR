The `nonsingular` function is intended to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities. However, the existing implementation is producing overflow errors when the difference between `vmin` and `vmax` is small. This issue is likely due to the precision of floating-point arithmetic, which requires a different approach to avoid these overflow errors.

To fix the issue, the code should be updated to handle small differences between `vmin` and `vmax` without causing overflow errors. Changing the conditional check on `vmax - vmin` to handle overflow conditions and ensuring the arithmetic operations do not generate overflow is necessary.

Here is a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    delta = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    absdelta = abs(delta)

    if maxabsvalue > 0 and (absdelta / maxabsvalue) < (tiny / 1e10) or np.isclose(vmin, vmax):
        vmin -= expander * maxabsvalue
        vmax += expander * maxabsvalue
        if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
            return -expander, expander

    if (vmax < vmin and not increasing) or (vmin < vmax and increasing):
        return vmin, vmax
    else:
        return vmax, vmin
```

With this corrected implementation, the `nonsingular` function should be able to handle small differences between `vmin` and `vmax` without causing overflow errors. As a result, the failing test should now pass.
