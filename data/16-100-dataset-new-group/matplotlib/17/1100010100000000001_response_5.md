The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the logic for modifying the endpoints to avoid singularities. The function includes conditions and calculations to adjust the endpoints if they are too small or approaching the double precision resolution limit.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is related to the incorrect adjustments made to the endpoints when the interval is too small or the inputs are inf or NaN. The function also does not handle the case in which both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for adjusting the endpoints based on the conditions provided in the function. This includes handling the cases where both inputs are 0 or very close to zero, and updating the adjustments based on the original interval.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif interval <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*(abs(vmin) + expander)
            vmax += expander*(abs(vmax) + expander)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have updated the logic for adjusting the endpoints by calculating the interval between `vmin` and `vmax`, and handling the cases where both inputs are very close to zero. We also addressed the adjustment calculations based on the original interval.
