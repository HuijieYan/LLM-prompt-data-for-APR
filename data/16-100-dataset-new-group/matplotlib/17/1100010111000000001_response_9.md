The potential error location in the `nonsingular` function is the calculation of the `vmin` and `vmax` values which might not be consistent with the test input parameters if the original interval is too small based on the `tiny` value or if the interval is smaller than the threshold set by `tiny`. This inconsistency could lead to the failure of the `test_colorbar_int` test function.

The cause of the bug is that the `nonsingular` function is not correctly handling edge cases where the interval is too small or where the inputs are inf or NaN.

To fix the bug, we can update the calculations for `vmin` and `vmax` to correctly handle potential edge cases where the original interval is too small or the inputs are inf or NaN.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif np.isclose(vmax, vmin, rtol=tiny, atol=expander):
        # Handle the case where the difference is less than the threshold
        diff = abs(vmax - vmin)
        if diff < tiny:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, we handle the edge case where the inputs are inf or NaN, and also handle the case where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small. This should address the issues in the original function and ensure that it passes the failing test.
