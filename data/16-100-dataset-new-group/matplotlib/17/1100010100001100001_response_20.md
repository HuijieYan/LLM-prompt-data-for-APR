The bug appears to be with the conditional statement for modifying the endpoints when the interval is smaller than the threshold value "tiny." 

For the first case, when the initial endpoints are 0 and 1, the maxabsvalue is calculated as 1.0. In this case, the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is satisfied, and the function should enter the `elif` block and execute the logic to modify the endpoints. However, the function incorrectly directly returns the initial endpoints instead.

For the second and third cases, the variable `maxabsvalue` is being calculated correctly, but it's not correctly used in the conditional statement to identify and modify the range as needed.

For the fourth case, the conditional statement for checking if `vmin` or `vmax` are not finite is incorrect. It should not be returning `-expander` and `expander` in this case.

The function should be fixed by modifying the conditional logic for modifying endpoints based on the calculated `maxabsvalue` and the input thresholds. 

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if vmax < vmin and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, the conditional statements have been modified to correctly compare the interval size with the `maxabsvalue * tiny` and to correctly check for finite values for `vmin` and `vmax`. Also, the logic for swapping the endpoints has been updated.
