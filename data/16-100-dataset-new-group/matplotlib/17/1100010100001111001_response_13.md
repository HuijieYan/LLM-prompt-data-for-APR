There are several issues with the `nonsingular` function that need to be addressed. 

First, the condition `vmax < vmin` is not checking for infinity values, which can cause an issue as identified in Case 4, where the input parameters are `-inf` and `inf`. 

Second, when `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`, the logic for updating `vmin` and `vmax` does not correctly handle the case when both `vmin` and `vmax` are negative. As identified in Case 3, swapping the values and adding the expander can lead to incorrect results.

To fix these issues, the logic in the `nonsingular` function can be modified to handle the cases involving infinity and negative values more effectively.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or vmin >= vmax:
        return -expander, expander

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        if vmin < 0 and vmax < 0:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax -= expander * abs(vmax)
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these updates, the corrected function should now handle the cases identified in the runtime input/output values and satisfy the expected input/output values for all the cases provided.
