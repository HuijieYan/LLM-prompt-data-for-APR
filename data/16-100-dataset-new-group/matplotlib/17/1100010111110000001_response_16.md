The buggy function `nonsingular` in `lib/matplotlib/transforms.py` is causing runtime warnings due to potential overflow during certain conditions. The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is generating `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`. The cause of these warnings can be traced back to the `nonsingular` function where the arithmetic operations might result in overflow.

One potential issue is the comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. There is a possibility of overflow occurring during this comparison, causing the runtime warning. Additionally, the assignment of `vmin` and `vmax` inside the `nonsingular` function might also cause overflow, especially for large integer values.

To fix the bug, the arithmetic operations and comparisons should be handled in a way that prevents potential overflow. One possible strategy is to use numpy's safe arithmetic functions which handle overflow and underflow gracefully. Additionally, the comparison should also be done in a way that avoids potential overflow. These modifications will prevent the runtime warnings and ensure the proper functioning of the `nonsingular` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = np.maximum(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif np.abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin = np.subtract(vmin, expander * np.abs(vmin))
            vmax = np.add(vmax, expander * np.abs(vmax))

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With the above corrections, the `nonsingular` function should now handle potential overflow cases and prevent the runtime warnings. The corrected version is expected to pass the failing test `test_colorbar_int`.
