The bug is primarily related to the condition checks on the `maxabsvalue` and the closeness of the interval `vmax - vmin` to `maxabsvalue * tiny`. The primary issue arises when the interval is very small or when both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or close to zero.

To address the bug, the condition checks and swapping logic within the function should be revised. Additionally, the choice of values for `expander` and `tiny` relative to `vmin` and `vmax` should be reconsidered.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or ((vmin == 0) and (vmax == 0)) or ((np.abs(vmax - vmin) < np.abs(vmin + vmax) * tiny)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if np.abs(vmax - vmin) < np.abs(vmin + vmax) * tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The updated function checks for valid finite values, interval closeness using `np.abs`, and the conditions when both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. The swapping logic is also modified to consider the `increasing` parameter. These changes address the bugs identified in the original function.
