### Code to be added/modified for fixing the bug
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/transforms.py

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    
    # code modification starts here
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        if not increasing:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            swapped = not swapped
    
    return vmin, vmax
    # code modification ends here
```
The bug is occurring as there is a missing else branch, so the rages of the values are modifying whenever the swapped condition does not meet our needs. To solve this missing branch, we need to add an else branch for the if swapped statement. Then assign the value not swapped whenever the condition is not met.
Though unit tests are not provided here for this specific function, it might be a good idea to create unit tests to verify this fix works as expected.
