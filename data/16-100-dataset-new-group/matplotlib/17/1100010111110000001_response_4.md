The buggy function `nonsingular` seems to be having issues with overflow being encountered in scalar absolute and scalar subtract, leading to RuntimeWarnings. These errors are caused by the maximum absolute value of the input endpoints exceeding the threshold set forth by the function definition and parameters.

To fix this bug, we will need to update the implementation of the `nonsingular` function to handle cases where the maximum absolute value of the input endpoints exceeds the threshold, and to address cases where overflow is encountered in scalar absolute and scalar subtract. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have updated the condition for checking `maxabsvalue` against the `tiny` threshold. We also addressed the situations when overflow warnings were encountered by using the `tiny` value directly in comparisons. These changes should fix the bug and ensure the function handles the input cases appropriately.
