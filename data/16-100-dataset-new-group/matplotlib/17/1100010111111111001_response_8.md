## Update the Buggy Function

The issue with the buggy function seems to be that it is not handling the edge cases properly, particularly when dealing with extreme values. This is causing `RuntimeWarning` and `overflow` issues when the function is used in tests.

The main issue lies in the `nonsingular` function's handling of extreme values. The function does not correctly account for extreme values of `vmin` and `vmax`, leading to runtime warnings and overflow issues during test execution.

The bugs can be resolved by updating the `nonsingular` function to handle extreme input values and edge cases more effectively. Specifically, we need to address the handling of `inf` and `-inf` values, as well as the handling of very large and very small input values.

Below is the updated and corrected version of the `nonsingular` function that addresses the issues:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded. This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if np.isinf(vmin) or np.isinf(vmax):
        return vmin, vmax

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        expander = max(expander, tiny)
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function improves the handling of extreme input values and edge cases, ensuring that the function does not encounter runtime warnings and overflow issues during test execution.

With these improvements, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
