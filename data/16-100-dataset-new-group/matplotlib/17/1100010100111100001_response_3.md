The bug occurs because the function `nonsingular` is not handling the values passed to it properly. Specifically, it's not addressing potential overflows when handling large numbers to avoid singularities. The `elif` condition checking for the difference `vmax - vmin` is not sufficient to handle very large numbers. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the function to handle large values properly by changing the condition to handle the possibility of overflow.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif np.abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny and np.abs(vmax) + np.abs(vmin) < np.finfo(float).max * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the `elif` condition has been adjusted to handle potential overflows correctly by checking the absolute values of `vmax - vmin` and `vmax` and `vmin`. Additionally, `np.finfo(float).max` is used to check for large number overflow.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
