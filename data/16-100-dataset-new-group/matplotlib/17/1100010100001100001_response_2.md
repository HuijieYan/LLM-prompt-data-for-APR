The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the condition checks when updating the values of `vmin` and `vmax`. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are extremely small in relation to `tiny` and `expander`, or when `vmin` and `vmax` are switched due to the `increasing` argument.

A potential cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of very small intervals, as well as the mismatch in types when comparing floating-point numbers and integers.

To fix the bug, the following corrected version of the `nonsingular` function could be used:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    def update_intervals(vmin, vmax):
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
        if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
            return -expander, expander
        elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                return -expander, expander
            else:
                return (vmin - expander * abs(vmin), vmax + expander * abs(vmax))
        else:
            return vmin, vmax

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmax, vmin = vmin, vmax

    return update_intervals(vmin, vmax)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues with interval handling and correctly compares floating-point numbers. It also separates the interval update logic into a separate function to improve readability and maintainability.
