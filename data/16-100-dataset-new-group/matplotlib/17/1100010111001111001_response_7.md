The issue with the current implementation of the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the calculation for expanding the input values when the interval is too small. There is a conditional check that appears to be incorrect, which leads to the incorrect expansion of the interval in certain cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks so that they accurately identify cases where the interval is too small and carry out the appropriate expansion of the endpoints.

Here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as before)
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin

    if interval < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if (vmin > vmax) and (not increasing):
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected function addresses the conditional checks involving interval size, endpoint swapping, and expansion, ensuring that the endpoints are modified accurately based on the specified conditions.

With this correction, the `nonsingular` function should now pass all the previously failing cases and be able to handle a wider range of input intervals correctly.
