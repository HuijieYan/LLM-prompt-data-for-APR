The cause of the bug is that the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` and the check for `maxabsvalue` are not correctly handled under various conditions, so the function is returning incorrect results in those cases.

The potential errors are:
1. The swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` doesn't properly set the `swapped` variable to `True`.
2. The check for `maxabsvalue` may lead to incorrect results due to wrong conditional statements.

To fix the bug:
1. Make sure that the `swapped` variable is properly set to `True` when `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped.
2. Modify the condition to calculate `maxabsvalue` accurately and set the endpoint range as needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ...

    Returns
    -------
    ...
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing:
        if vmax < vmin:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if increasing:
        if maxabsvalue < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
    else:
        if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected function, it should pass all the expected cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
