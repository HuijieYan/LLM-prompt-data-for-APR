The buggy function `nonsingular()` returns a RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract when running the test. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of `vmax - vmin` and `maxabsvalue * tiny` when `vmax` is very close to `vmin` or when both endpoints are 0. It could be caused by the comparison of float numbers and rounding errors.

To fix the bug, I will revise how `vmin` and `vmax` are adjusted when they are too close to each other or close to zero.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny and vmax - vmin < 2 * tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) < tiny and abs(vmin) < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    
    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version includes additional checks to avoid the rounding error problem when comparing float numbers close to zero. The adjustments to `vmin` and `vmax` have been modified to ensure they are properly expanded when necessary.
