The problem in the given function arises when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small, leading to an overflow warning during subtraction. This could happen when the difference is smaller than `maxabsvalue * tiny`.

The function returns `-expander`, `expander` if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not finite. However, this could lead to the function returning incorrect values and not effectively avoiding singularities as intended.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the case when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small. We should check if `vmax` and `vmin` are finite, and if they are not, we should return `-expander`, `expander`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
  
    if vmax - vmin < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin = max(vmin - expander*abs(vmin), -expander)
        vmax = min(vmax + expander*abs(vmax), expander)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
