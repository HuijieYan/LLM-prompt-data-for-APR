The bug occurs when the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is evaluated alongside the sub-condition `vmax == 0 and vmin == 0` in the buggy function. When evaluating Case 1, the buggy function does not expand the range as required. This is because the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is false, and the conditions `vmin == 0` and `vmax == 0` are also false. As a result, the endpoint values remain unchanged.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the condition that checks if the range is smaller than the threshold value and require expansion.

Also, there is a minor issue caused by datatype conversion. Some input parameters are received as integer types and converted to float inside the buggy function. I will also make sure to convert input integers to float for consistency.

Taking into account these considerations, below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = vmin - expander
        vmax = vmax + expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
