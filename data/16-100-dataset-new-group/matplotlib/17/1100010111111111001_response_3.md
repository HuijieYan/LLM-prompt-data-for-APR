The issue with the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the comparison of values close to zero. The function doesn't handle very small differences between `vmin` and `vmax` properly, which leads to overflow errors and incorrect results.

To fix this issue, we need to revise the logic of how the function determines whether the interval is too small and needs to be expanded.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if np.isinf(vmin) or np.isinf(vmax) or (np.abs(vmin) < 1e-15 and np.abs(vmax) < 1e-15):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    interval = vmax - vmin
    if interval < tiny:
        vmin -= expander / 2
        vmax += expander / 2

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By using the corrected logic to handle small intervals and edge cases, the `nonsingular` function should now pass all the failing tests and provide the expected results.
