The buggy function has a bug due to incorrect comparison operations in the conditionals and an issue with how the expander is applied. The bug is causing the function to behave differently based on the input values and is not modifying the endpoints correctly.

The bug occurs because the condition in the conditionals for checking if the interval is smaller than 'tiny' to be expanded is incorrect and does not appropriately handle the scenario when both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

To fix the bug, the conditionals should be modified and the comparison operations should be updated so that the correct interval expansion takes place based on the input values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif interval <= maxabsvalue * tiny:  
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) + tiny
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax) + tiny

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the issue in the original function by updating and correcting the conditionals and the interval expansion logic to ensure that the function behaves as expected for various input values and provides the correct endpoints.
