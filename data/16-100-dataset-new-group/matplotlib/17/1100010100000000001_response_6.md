The potential error in the provided code is that it does not correctly handle the cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are NaN or 0/close to zero. Additionally, the swapping logic with the `increasing` parameter is not implemented correctly.

The cause of the bug in the code is that it does not properly check for the conditions when both inputs are NaN or 0/close to zero and it does not handle the swapping according to the `increasing` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling NaN, 0, and close to 0 cases and update the swapping logic according to the `increasing` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    else:
        if vmax > vmin:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, I removed the unnecessary `swapped` variable and replaced the logic for swapping according to the `increasing` parameter. Additionally, I modified the condition for handling small intervals and added handling for NaN, 0, and close to 0 cases.
