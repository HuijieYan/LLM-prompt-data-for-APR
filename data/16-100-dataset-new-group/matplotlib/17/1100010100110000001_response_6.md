The error message suggests possible overflow problems encountered in the `nonsingular` function. The `overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `overflow encountered in scalar absolute` runtime warnings indicate that there may be issues with the arithmetic operations within the `nonsingular` function.

The issue is likely caused by performing arithmetic operations on numbers that are too big to be handled by the data type used, which in this case is likely to be floating-point numbers. The bug check for `(not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax))` seems to be missing the cases when the interval of `vmax - vmin` is small enough to warrant the expansion. There seems to be some issue with the order of operations when calculating `vmax - vmin`.

To fix this bug, the code should handle the small interval scenario. This can be done by addressing it in the elif condition by checking both the difference between vmax and vmin, and the values of vmax and vmin for small intervals:

```python
elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)):
    if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) * np.sign(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax) * np.sign(vmax)
```

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) * np.sign(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) * np.sign(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
