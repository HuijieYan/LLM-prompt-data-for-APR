The bug in the `nonsingular` function is that it fails to handle the case when both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or very close to zero. When that happens, the function incorrectly returns `-expander, expander` instead of returning `vmin - expander, vmax + expander`. Additionally, the condition for checking very small intervals using the `tiny` variable is incorrect, and needs to be re-evaluated as it could cause unwanted results.

Looking at the failing tests for the function, the bug can be identified by the incorrect return values of the function for Cases 1, 7, and 8. The return values don't reflect the expected behavior based on the input values and the purpose of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic dealing with very small intervals and both `vmin` and `vmax` being 0 or very close to zero.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander
    elif vmax - vmin < tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version ensures that the function handles the edge cases more accurately and returns the expected results given the input values.
