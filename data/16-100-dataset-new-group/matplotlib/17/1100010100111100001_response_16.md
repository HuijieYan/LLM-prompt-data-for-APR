Based on the error messages and the runtime input/output variable values, it appears that the primary issue is caused by overflow encountered in the comparison of the `vmax` and `vmin` values.

The original `nonsingular` function displays multiple runtime warnings indicating that overflow was encountered in scalar arithmetic operations and absolute value calculations. These would likely be caused by the large values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

To fix the bug, the primary approach is to handle the large input values more effectively and prevent potential overflow during arithmetic operations.

Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded. This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or np.abs(vmin) < tiny or np.abs(vmax) < tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval = np.abs(vmax - vmin)
    maxabsvalue = max(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif interval < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin = vmin - expander * np.abs(vmin)
        vmax = vmax + expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

With the corrected function, the handling of extreme values and arithmetic operations should be more robust and handle the cases reflected in the failing tests appropriately.
