The bug in this `nonsingular` function can be observed in the `elif` clause where `vmin` and `vmax` are updated when their difference is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue * tiny`. This clause should be triggered only when the original interval is smaller than the `tiny` threshold.

The improvement to fix the bug is to check if the interval is smaller than `tiny` rather than having it depend directly on the comparison between `vmax` and `vmin`.

Here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmax > vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif (vmax - vmin) < tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The modification, in this case, eliminates a scenario where the interval `vmax - vmin` could be greater than `tiny`, but still results in updating `vmax` and `vmin`.
