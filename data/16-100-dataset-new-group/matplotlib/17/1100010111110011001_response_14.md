The bug seems to be caused by the nonsingular function not handling certain edge cases for input values appropriately, leading to overflow errors.

One potential issue is that the function does not handle cases where the difference between vmax and vmin exceeds the threshold set by tiny, which is likely to trigger the RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract in the failing test case. Another potential issue is with the maxabsvalue calculation, which may be incorrectly computing the maximum absolute value of the endpoints.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully handle the cases where the difference between vmax and vmin exceeds the threshold set by tiny, and to revise the maxabsvalue calculation to correctly compute the maximum absolute value of the endpoints.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing:
        if vmax < vmin:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    else:
        if vmin < vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            vmin = max(vmin - expander*abs(vmin), -expander)
            vmax = min(vmax + expander*abs(vmax), expander)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function should handle the edge cases appropriately and pass the failing test cases.
