The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the condition where the variable `maxabsvalue` is used. This condition is incorrectly checking if `maxabsvalue` is less than a specific value based on `tiny` and `np.finfo(float).tiny`. 

The cause of the bug is that the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is not handling the check for the interval being too small correctly, leading to incorrect adjustments of the `vmin` and `vmax` endpoints.

To fix the bug, we can change how the condition is evaluated and apply the appropriate adjustments when the interval is too small.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, we removed the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` and replaced it with a direct check for `vmax - vmin <= tiny`. This change ensures that adjustments are made accurately when the interval is too small.
