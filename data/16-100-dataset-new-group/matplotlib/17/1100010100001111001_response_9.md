The bug seems to stem from the conditionals where the intervals are too small. In the first case, the bootstrap issue where `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is the computer representation of maxabsvalue < 1.5 * 1.2e-19. The second case also failed because the value only adds 1.5 * 1.2e-19, giving the same result as the first case. The third case successfully swapped and computed values properly. The fourth case is an inf variable, the current function handles it properly. The fifth, sixth, and seventh case are also successfully processed.

Hence, the bug is related to the conditionals and the computation of the new values vmin and vmax within specific ranges.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to adjust the ranges and the computation of the new values for vmin and vmax in the function.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin
    if interval < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        elif vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
