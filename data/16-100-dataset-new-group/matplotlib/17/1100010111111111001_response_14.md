The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities. After analyzing the runtime input/output values, the expected input/output values, and the failing test, it appears that the issue lies with the comparison and manipulation of floating point numbers. In particular, when the difference `vmax - vmin` is very small, unexpected behavior occurs. 

To fix the bug, we will modify the logic for handling cases when `vmax - vmin` is very small. By adding checks for NaN and np.inf, and properly handling the subtraction, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected. 

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif np.isclose(vmax, vmin, atol=tiny):  # handle case where the difference is very small
        if np.isnan(vmax) or np.isinf(vmax) or np.isnan(vmin) or np.isinf(vmin):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected version, the `nonsingular` function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
