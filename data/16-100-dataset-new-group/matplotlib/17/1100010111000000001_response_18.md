The issue is with the `nonsingular` function which is not properly handling the vmin and vmax values, resulting in failing the test. The `nonsingular` function needs to be modified to correctly adjust the vmin and vmax values based on certain conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    max_abs_value = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if max_abs_value < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        if vmax - vmin <= max_abs_value * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) / 2
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax) / 2

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function properly handles the cases where vmin, vmax are not finite, where vmin is greater than vmax when increasing is False, and also properly adjusts the vmin and vmax values based on their absolute difference and magnitude.
