The issue with the `nonsingular` function seems to be in the logic where it checks for the interval size and updates the `vmin` and `vmax` values accordingly. The function does not handle certain corner cases properly, which is causing it to fail with the given test.

The strategy to fix the bug would be to carefully evaluate and modify the logic to correctly handle the cases when `vmin` or `vmax` are inf or NaN, or when both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

Here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if np.isnan(vmin) or np.isnan(vmax) or not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        interval = vmax - vmin
        if np.isclose(interval, 0.0, atol=tiny):
            if np.isclose(vmin, 0.0, atol=tiny) and np.isclose(vmax, 0.0, atol=tiny):
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version handles the cases of inf, NaN, and very small values properly. Additionally, it also correctly accounts for the increasing parameter and updates `vmin` and `vmax` accordingly. With this correction, the given test should pass successfully.
