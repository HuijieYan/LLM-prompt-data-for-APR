The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent assignments of `vmin` and `vmax`. The function currently does not handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are very large, leading to overflow issues. Additionally, if `vmax` and `vmin` are too close to each other, the function incorrectly modifies their values, leading to incorrect outputs and overflow warnings.

To fix the bug, we need to address the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the adjustment of `vmin` and `vmax` when their difference is smaller than a threshold. The corrected function also needs to demonstrate reasonable handling of edge cases such as large or too close `vmin` and `vmax` values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as before)

    Returns
    -------
    ... (same as before)
    """
    # Handling infinite values or NaN
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Swapping vmin and vmax if necessary
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    elif not increasing and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    # Updating maxabsvalue
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    # Checking if the interval difference is smaller than the threshold
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function should now handle all input cases correctly, resolving the overflow and warning issues and passing the failing test cases.
