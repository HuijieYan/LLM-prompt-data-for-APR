The error is due to the function `nonsingular` failing to account for numerical precision and potential overflow errors. 

In the given error messages, we can see that the warnings "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute" are occurring when performing arithmetic operations.

To fix the bug, we need to handle potential overflow scenarios and ensure that calculations do not result in overflow errors or precision issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded. This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    # Additional checks for overflow during subtraction and absolute value calculation
    elif abs(vmax) - abs(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) if expander * abs(vmin) <= np.finfo(float).max else 0.0
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) if expander * abs(vmax) <= np.finfo(float).max else 0.0
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the arithmetic operations are safeguarded against potential overflow using the conditional checks to ensure that calculations don't result in overflow errors or precision issues.
