The bug in the `nonsingular` function is likely due to the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. In particular, it's not properly handling values close to the edge of representable float numbers, leading to overflow errors or incorrect results.

The function should be fixed to correctly calculate `maxabsvalue` and handle cases where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small or close to the edge of float precision.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version ensures that `maxabsvalue` is calculated correctly and that the subsequent checks handle small intervals and edge cases appropriately.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing tests and maintain the expected input/output values.
