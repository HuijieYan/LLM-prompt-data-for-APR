The buggy function `nonsingular` has several issues:

1. The code does not handle the case when both inputs (`vmin` and `vmax`) are 0 or very close to zero as specified in the docstring.
2. The conditional logic is incorrectly evaluating when to expand and modify the endpoints based on the range size and maximum absolute value of the endpoints.

To fix the bugs in the `nonsingular` function, the following changes are proposed:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not (np.isfinite(vmin)) or not (np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin + vmax) == 0:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue <= tiny or (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = (vmax, vmin) if vmax < vmin else (vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

The fixes involve proper handling of the zero or close to zero value case and modifying the conditional logic to correctly evaluate when to expand and modify the endpoints. After making these changes, the `nonsingular` function should work as intended and pass the provided cases.
