The potential bugs in the `nonsingular` function could be related to the conditional checks and calculations. Let's analyze the function step by step.

1. The initial conditional check for non-finite values is correct.

2. The `swapped` flag seems to have an issue as it is not correctly identifying whether the `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped or not.

3. The comparison `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` seems incorrect and might not handle cases as expected.

4. The following conditional block may not be correct as it is also not handling the cases as expected.

4. The last conditional check for `swapped` seems correct.

To fix these issues:
- Modify the `swapped` flag logic to ensure that it correctly identifies whether `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped or not.
- Review and correct the comparison `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` and the following conditional block for handling the cases correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these changes, the corrected `nonsingular` function should pass the failing test.
