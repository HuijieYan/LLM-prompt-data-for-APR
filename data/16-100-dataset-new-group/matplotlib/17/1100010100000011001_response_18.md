The buggy function seems to have an issue with the logic for checking the size of the interval and modifying the endpoints accordingly.

The potential error locations within the function include:
1. Calculation of `maxabsvalue`.
2. Comparisons for interval size and adjustments to the endpoints.
3. Handling of swapped endpoints based on the `increasing` parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the cases where the interval size is small or the endpoints are swapped.

To fix the bug, we need to re-evaluate the logic for checking the interval size and modifying the endpoints accordingly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the swapped endpoints are handled correctly based on the `increasing` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with handling swapped endpoints based on the `increasing` parameter and correctly adjusts the interval size and endpoints.
