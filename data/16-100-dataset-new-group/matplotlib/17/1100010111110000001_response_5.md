The cause of the error is due to the float values of `vmin` and `vmax` that are causing an overflow and resulting in a `RuntimeWarning`. This is happening specifically at the line `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. The error is due to the input value exceeding the limit, and as a result, the function is returning incorrect values for `vmin` and `vmax`, which leads to the failing test.

The buggy function `nonsingular` can be fixed by adding a condition to check if the absolute value of `vmin` or `vmax` is infinite and returning the correct values based on that condition. Additionally, removing the condition that sets `vmin` and `vmax` to -expander and expander when the difference between them is smaller than the specified tiny value can help fix the error.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints. If the interval is smaller than this,
        it will be expanded. This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise, the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
  
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With the corrections made, this version of the function should pass the failing test.
