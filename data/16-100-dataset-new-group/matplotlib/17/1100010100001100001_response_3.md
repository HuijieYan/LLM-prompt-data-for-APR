The issue seems to be with the comparison of floating-point numbers and the condition checks involving the `tiny` variable. In some cases, the condition checks are not effectively handling the numerical precision of the variables, leading to incorrect expansions or swaps.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to correct the condition checks to account for floating-point comparisons properly and ensure that the expansions and swaps are performed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (np.isinf(vmin) and np.isinf(vmax)) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif (vmax - vmin) < (maxabsvalue * tiny):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            exp = expander * maxabsvalue
            vmin -= exp
            vmax += exp

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the condition checks have been modified to handle edge cases properly and comparisons involving floating-point numbers are adjusted according to the expected precision.

This revision should address the issues identified and improve the behavior of the function.
