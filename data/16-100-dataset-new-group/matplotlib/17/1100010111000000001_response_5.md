The buggy function `nonsingular` has issues with handling small values and swapping vmin and vmax. The test_colorbar_int test function is failing because the vmin and vmax values are not being handled correctly when they are very small or when vmax is less than vmin.

The strategy to fix the bug would be to update the `nonsingular` function to correctly handle small values and swapping vmin and vmax. This can be achieved by updating the condition checks and manipulation of vmin and vmax accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
