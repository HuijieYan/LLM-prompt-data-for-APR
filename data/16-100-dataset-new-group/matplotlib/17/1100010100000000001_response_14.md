The buggy function has several potential error locations:

1. The condition for returning -expander and expander is unclear. It checks for infinity and NaN, but it's not clear why it returns those specific values.

2. The logic for handling small intervals (vmax - vmin) is overly complex and may not cover all cases.

3. The variable `swapped` is used to track whether the endpoints were swapped, but it's not consistently used in the logic.

4. The function may not handle edge cases involving zero values correctly.

5. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is difficult to follow and seems overly complex.

To fix the bugs, we should simplify the logic in the function and ensure that it handles edge cases correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function with simplified logic and improved handling of edge cases:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander
        
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if interval <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, we simplified the code by using fewer conditions and better variable names to improve readability. We also handled the edge cases for infinity, NaN, and zero values more explicitly. This version should be more robust and easier to understand.
