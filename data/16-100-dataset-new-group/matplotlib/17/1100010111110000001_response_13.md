The cause of the bug is in the `nonsingular` function where the line `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` is throwing a RuntimeWarning for overflow encountered in scalar absolute. This is due to the maxabsvalue variable being unable to handle the absolute of very negative `int16` values.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the calculation for `maxabsvalue` in the `nonsingular` function to handle the overflow encountered issue. This can be achieved by ensuring that the `int16` values are cast to `float` to avoid the error.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected version, the `nonsingular` function will no longer throw a RuntimeWarning for overflow and will pass the failing test.
