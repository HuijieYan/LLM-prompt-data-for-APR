The potential error in the `nonsingular` function seems to be in the logic for expanding the range when it is too small, and in the calculation of the condition for expanding the range. The bug could be causing the function to return incorrect values for `vmin` and `vmax` when the range is too small.

The buggy function `nonsingular` seems to have a logical error in the if-else block where it determines whether to expand the range based on the size of the interval and the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. Additionally, there is a logical error in the check for swapped values when `increasing` is set to False.

To fix the bug:
1. Correct the logic for determining when to expand the range based on the size of the interval and the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.
2. Fix the logic for checking swapped values when `increasing` is set to False.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmin > vmax and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    if np.isclose(vmin, vmax, atol=tiny):
        if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expand = expander * (1 + abs(vmin) + abs(vmax))
            vmin -= expand
            vmax += expand
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

With the corrected version, the `nonsingular` function should now pass the failing test.
