The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the incorrect calculation of the `maxabsvalue` variable and unnecessary conversion of input types to `float` in the test cases. The function fails to correctly handle the `maxabsvalue` calculation when the input values are integers. This causes an inconsistency in handling the edge cases where the input values are close to 0 or very large, leading to incorrect returns and warnings.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `maxabsvalue` is correctly computed based on the absolute maximum value of `vmin` and `vmax`, regardless of their original data type.

This solution will involve fixing the type conversion and the computation of `maxabsvalue` in the function. Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function ensures that the `maxabsvalue` is always correctly calculated, regardless of the input types, and thus addresses the bug.

By using explicit type conversion `float(vmin)` and `float(vmax)` when calculating `maxabsvalue`, we ensure that these values are consistently treated as floating-point numbers, resolving the inconsistency in the function's behavior and removing potential warnings.
