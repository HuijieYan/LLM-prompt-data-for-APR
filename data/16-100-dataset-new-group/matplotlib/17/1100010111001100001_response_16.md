The issue seems to be in the `nonsingular` function where it manipulates the `vmin` and `vmax` values based on certain conditions. It seems to be failing for very large values as well as for infinities.

The issue is most likely due to the way the function handles extreme values compared to the expected types and ranges.

To address the issue, the function needs to be modified to handle the situations where the input values are very large or infinite such that it returns valid and appropriate values.

Here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
        if swapped and not increasing:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        return vmin, vmax

    if np.isinf(maxabsvalue):
        if increasing:
            return maxabsvalue, np.nextafter(maxabsvalue, maxabsvalue + 1)
        else:
            return np.nextafter(maxabsvalue, maxabsvalue - 1), maxabsvalue

    elif almost_equal(vmin, vmax, tiny):
        if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax

def almost_equal(v1, v2, tiny):
    return abs(v1 - v2) <= tiny
```

In this corrected version, handling of extreme values and infinities has been included. The `almost_equal` function is used to compare floating point values within a certain tolerance to account for precision issues in floating point comparisons. Additionally, handling for infinities has been added to return valid values in such scenarios. Note that the `almost_equal` function has been added as its implementation wasn't provided and is needed for the corrected version.

Using this corrected function should address the failures observed in the test cases provided.
