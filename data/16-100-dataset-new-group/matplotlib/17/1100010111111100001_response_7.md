To fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function, we need to correct the conditional checks and updates to the `vmin` and `vmax` values. The bug seems to be related to those checks failing to handle large values properly and producing runtime warnings.

The issue arises when the interval is very small compared to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints, leading to potential overflows or other numerical issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 * tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * maxabsvalue
            vmax += expander * maxabsvalue
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version updates the checks and updates to `vmin` and `vmax` based on the conditions that caused the failing tests. Additionally, we've accounted for the case where `increasing` is set to `True`, to ensure that the given behavior is respected.

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass without triggering any runtime warnings or errors.
