### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The error messages indicate that there is a "RuntimeWarning" regarding overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and scalar absolute. This suggests that there may be an issue with the calculation of the scalar values and their absolute values, possibly leading to overflow.
2. The `elif` condition in the function seems to be the potential cause of the issue.

### Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the corresponding error message
The bug in the function `nonsingular` is causing runtime warnings related to overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and scalar absolute. This points to potential numeric issues within the function, particularly involving the `elif` condition, where the arithmetic operations may lead to overflow.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we should revisit the arithmetic operations in the `nonsingular` function to ensure that they handle large numeric values without experiencing overflow errors. In particular, it is necessary to review the `elif` condition to avoid any arithmetic operations that may lead to overflow. 

### The corrected version

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
