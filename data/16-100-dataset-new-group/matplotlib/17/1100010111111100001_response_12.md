The cause of the bug in the `nonsingular` function is that it does not properly handle very large or very small input values. Specifically, when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` exceeds a certain threshold, it encounters an overflow error. Also, it does not correctly handle the case when both inputs are very close to zero. It needs to be modified to account for handling these cases.

To address the bug, it's important to check for edge cases - particularly when `vmax` and `vmin` are very large or close to zero. We should consider the scenarios when `vmax` - `vmin` exceeds a certain threshold and also when both inputs are close to zero. For example, when `vmin` and `vmax` are very large or very small, their difference may result in an overflow error.

Given the information provided and the cases analyzed, here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    elif np.isclose(vmax, vmin, atol=1e-15):
        return -expander, expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version of the function, we handle the `overflow` and `abs` errors by returning the `-expander, expander` values for those scenarios. Additionally, we use `np.isclose` to handle the case when `vmax` and `vmin` are very close to each other.

By making these changes, the `nonsingular` function should now be able to handle the failing test cases and correctly avoid singularities.
