The `nonsingular` function has several potential error locations. One of the potential issues is that the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is comparing floating point numbers, which can lead to rounding errors. Another potential issue is the condition `if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0`, which may not handle small non-zero values properly.

The buggy function is failing the test because the `nonsingular` function is not correctly handling the input endpoints. As a result, the `vmin` and `vmax` values produced by the `nonsingular` function are not matching the expected `clim` values in the test.

To fix the bug, the `nonsingular` function should handle the input endpoints more robustly, ensuring that small intervals are correctly expanded without introducing rounding errors. Additionally, the function should handle special cases like when both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or very close to zero.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if np.isclose(vmin, vmax, rtol=0, atol=max(tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)), tiny)):
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)):
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should now pass the failing test.
