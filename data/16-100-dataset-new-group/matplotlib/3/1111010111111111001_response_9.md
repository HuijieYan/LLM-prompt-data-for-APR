## The buggy function

The `_recache` function is supposed to recalculate the marker path and transformation when the marker style is updated. However, it is currently setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` unconditionally, which is not correct. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False` for markers with fill style `'none'`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

We need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style of the marker. We can do this by checking the fill style and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

## The corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```
