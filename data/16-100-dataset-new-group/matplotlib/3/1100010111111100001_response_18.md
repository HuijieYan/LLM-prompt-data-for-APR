The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is not returning the correct value.

The likely cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`.

To fix this bug, we should update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, we ensure that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class will return the correct value.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, as the `is_filled` method will return the expected value based on the `fillstyle`.
