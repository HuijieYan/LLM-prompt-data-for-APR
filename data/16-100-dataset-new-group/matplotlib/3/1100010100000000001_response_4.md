The buggy function _recache(self) is meant to reset various attributes to their initial state and then call the _marker_function. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the assignment of self._transform and the call to self._marker_function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is attempting to call self._marker_function without first checking if it exists. This can lead to a "NoneType" object has no attribute error if self._marker_function is not defined.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that self._marker_function is not None before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
