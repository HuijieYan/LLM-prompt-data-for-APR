## Analysis
The issue described on GitHub indicates that the markers are not hollow when the fillstyle parameter is set to 'none'. The provided code for reproduction attempts to use a custom MarkerStyle with fillstyle set to 'none' when calling the ax.scatter() function, but the result is not as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue seems to be related to the custom MarkerStyle and its handling of the fillstyle parameter. The _recache() function that is used internally in MarkerStyle may not be correctly handling the fillstyle parameter, which might be causing the markers to not appear as hollow when expected.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect handling or initialization of the fillstyle parameter within the _recache() function. This is likely causing the markers to always be filled, regardless of the fillstyle parameter passed when using a custom MarkerStyle.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the _recache() function needs to be modified to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter. The function should check the fillstyle parameter and appropriately set the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle value.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check the fillstyle parameter and set the _filled attribute accordingly. If the fillstyle is 'none', the _filled attribute is set to False, indicating that the markers should be hollow. Otherwise, it is set to True, indicating that the markers should be filled as usual.
