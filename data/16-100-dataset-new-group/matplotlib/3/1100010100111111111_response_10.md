## Correction

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` variable is being set to `False` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function, regardless of the fill style specified in the `MarkerStyle` object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to take into account the fill style specified in the `MarkerStyle` object and set the `_filled` variable accordingly.

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# This is the corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `_filled` based on the fill style specified in the `MarkerStyle` object, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
