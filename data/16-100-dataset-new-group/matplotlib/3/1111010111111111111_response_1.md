### Potential Error Location
The bug is likely located in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter being set to `'none'`.

### Cause of the Bug
The `fillstyle` parameter being set to `'none'` should result in the `_filled` attribute being set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. However, in the current implementation, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, resulting in the marker not being hollow as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be updated based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected function ensures that the marker is filled or hollow as expected, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
