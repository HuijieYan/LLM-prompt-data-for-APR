## The bug analysis
The `_recache` function is not properly updating the `self._filled` attribute when the marker function is called. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should not, leading to a failing test.

## Bug locations
The buggy function `_recache` fails to properly update the `self._filled` attribute, leading to incorrect behavior when the `is_filled` method is called.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is the failure to update the `self._filled` attribute when the marker function is called.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to properly update the `self._filled` attribute based on the marker style.

## The corrected function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = not self._filled if hasattr(self._marker_function, 'filled') else True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check to see if the marker function has a `filled` attribute and updating the `_filled` attribute accordingly, we can fix the bug.

This corrected version of the `_recache` function should resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
