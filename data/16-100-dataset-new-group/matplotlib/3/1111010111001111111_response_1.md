To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to update the `self._filled` attribute to be `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This will ensure that the markers are hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `fillstyle` attribute is checked, and if it's set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow.

This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub, where the markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'`. Now, when using a custom `MarkerStyle` and setting `fillstyle='none'`, the markers will be hollow as expected.
