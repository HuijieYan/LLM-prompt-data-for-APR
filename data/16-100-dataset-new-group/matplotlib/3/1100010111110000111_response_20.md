The buggy function `_recache` in the file `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` is not correctly setting the marker to be 'hollow' when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is leading to a failing test and is also reported as a bug on GitHub.

The cause of the bug is that when `fillstyle='none'` is set, the `is_filled()` method returns `True` instead of `False`. This is because the `_recache` function is not correctly updating the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the case when `fillstyle='none'`. We will need to set `self._filled` attribute to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved.
