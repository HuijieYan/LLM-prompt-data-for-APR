## Correction

The buggy function fails to properly set the filled attribute to False when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This causes the is_filled() method to return True when it should return False.

To fix the bug, the _recache() function needs to be modified to properly handle the case when fillstyle is set to 'none'. The filled attribute should be set to False in this case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the markers should appear as hollow when using ax.scatter() with fillstyle set to 'none'. This addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the markers behave as expected.
