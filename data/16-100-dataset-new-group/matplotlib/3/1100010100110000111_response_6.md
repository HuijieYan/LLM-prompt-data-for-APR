## Analysis
The error message is indicating that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` unexpectedly. This is causing the test to fail and the custom marker to not display as hollow as intended by the user. The GitHub issue also confirms that setting `fillstyle='none'` is not producing the expected hollow marker.

## Identified Potential Error Location
The issue appears to be related to the `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file. Specifically, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally, which may be causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function unconditionally setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to the `is_filled()` method always returning `True`, causing the marker to be filled when it should be hollow.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`. This change will ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value and the marker will display as hollow when requested.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Updated to account for fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the `_filled` attribute, the bug should be fixed and the custom marker should display as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
