## The buggy function
The function '_recache' is responsible for updating the properties of the marker. The failing test is testing the fillstyle of the marker and is expected to fail because the fillstyle is not properly handled in the '_recache' method.

## Potential error locations
The bug might be caused by not properly handling the fillstyle in the '_recache' method, which results in the marker not being hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

## Cause of the bug
The buggy function does not update the fillstyle of the marker when the '_marker_function' is called. This causes the marker to not behave as expected, as evidenced by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the '_recache' function needs to handle the fillstyle property of the marker. This can be done by checking the fillstyle when the '_marker_function' is called and updating the marker accordingly.

## The corrected version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    if hasattr(self, '_fillstyle') and self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the fillstyle is checked and if it is set to 'none', then the marker is set to be hollow by setting '_filled' to False, otherwise, '_filled' is set to True. This change ensures that the marker behaves according to the fillstyle specified.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
