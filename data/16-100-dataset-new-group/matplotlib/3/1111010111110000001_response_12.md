The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the `filled` attribute, which leads to the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `is_filled` method is expecting the `_filled` attribute to be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but the `_recache` function always sets `_filled` to `True`.

To fix the bug, we should update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, the `_filled` attribute will now be correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, which should resolve the failing test.
