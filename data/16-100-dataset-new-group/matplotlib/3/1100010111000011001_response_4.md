The buggy function is supposed to recache some attributes when a marker function is called. However, it seems that the function is not setting the correct values for some variables, and it is not using the `marker_function` to recache the necessary attributes.

The `marker_function` should be used to recache the `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` attributes.

Based on the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` and the expected values and types of variables, it seems that the `_path` attribute is not being set correctly, and the `_filled` attribute is also not getting the correct value.

To fix the bug, the function `_recache` should be modified to use the `marker_function` to recache the necessary attributes and assign the correct values to them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path, self._transform = self._marker_function()

    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Assuming that the default value for filled should be False

```

With this correction, the `_recache` function should now correctly use the `marker_function` to recache the necessary attributes and set the expected values for the variables. This correction should make the function pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
