The bug seems to be related to the `is_filled` method not returning the expected value. This method checks the `_filled` attribute, but it is being set to `False` inside the `_recache` function, resulting in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we can simply set `_filled` to the value of `self._fillstyle != 'none'` inside the `_recache` function. This way, the `_filled` attribute will accurately reflect whether the marker is filled or not.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```
