## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class
The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the class `MarkerStyle`. It appears that this method is intended to update some internal state variables based on the current marker function. 

## Identifying potential error locations
The potential error locations in the `_recache` method are:
1. Use of `self._marker_function` without checking if it is set.
2. Lack of error handling if `self._marker_function` is not set.

## Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by directly calling `self._marker_function` without checking if it is set to a valid function. This can lead to a runtime error when calling an undefined function.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is set to a valid function before calling it. If it is not set, we should handle this condition gracefully, possibly by raising an error or setting a default marker function.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
        else:
            # Handle the case when _marker_function is not set
            # For example, raise an error or set a default marker function
            raise ValueError("_marker_function is not set")
```
