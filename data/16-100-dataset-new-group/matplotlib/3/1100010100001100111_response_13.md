The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to consider the value of `self._fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to create hollow markers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Consider the fillstyle when setting _filled
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will now properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, and the markers will be hollow when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not being rendered as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'.
