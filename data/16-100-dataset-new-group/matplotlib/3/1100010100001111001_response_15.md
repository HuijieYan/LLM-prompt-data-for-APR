The bug in the _recache function appears to be that the self._filled variable is being set to True regardless of the value of self._fillstyle. This is likely causing incorrect behavior in the function, leading to unexpected results.

To fix this bug, we should update the function to set the self._filled variable based on the value of self._fillstyle. If self._fillstyle is 'none', then self._filled should be set to False, otherwise it should be set to True.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
