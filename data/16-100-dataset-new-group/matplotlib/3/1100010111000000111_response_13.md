## Analysis
The `_recache` function is failing to correctly set the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, which is causing the markers to not be hollow as expected.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_recache` function, specifically in the logic that sets the `_filled` attribute.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. We can do this by checking the `fillstyle` parameter and updating the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `fillstyle` in the `_recache` function and updating the `_filled` attribute accordingly, this corrected version should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the test function `test_marker_fillstyle` pass.
