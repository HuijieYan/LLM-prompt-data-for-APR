## The cause of the bug
The `is_filled()` method is returning the opposite of the expected value, and this is causing the AssertionError. This method is related to the `_filled` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class. Looking at the `_recache` function, we can see that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` by default. However, the `is_filled()` method seems to be checking for something else that is causing it to return the opposite of the expected value.

## A strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_filled()` method correctly checks the `_filled` attribute and returns the expected value. This may involve modifying the way the `_filled` attribute is used within the `MarkerStyle` class or adjusting the logic within the `is_filled()` method.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before calling it. This will prevent any unexpected behavior when calling the function, which could have been the cause of the incorrect return value from the `is_filled()` method.
