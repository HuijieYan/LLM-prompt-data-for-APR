## Explanation
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes some variables and then calls the `_marker_function`. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, which means that the `_marker_function` is likely setting the `_filled` variable to `True` when it should not be.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `_marker_function` does not set the `_filled` variable to `True` if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```
In this corrected version, if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` variable is set to `False` before calling the `_marker_function`. This ensures that the `_filled` variable is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
