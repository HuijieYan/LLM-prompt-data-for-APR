The bug seems to be in the `_recache` function, where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` regardless of the fill style parameter. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` for markers with fill styles that are supposed to be empty.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the fill style when setting the `_filled` attribute. If the fill style is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `is_filled` method will return the correct value based on the fill style parameter.
