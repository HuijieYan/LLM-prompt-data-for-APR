The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the `test_marker_fillstyle` test to fail. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it is expected to return `False`.

The issue is related to custom marker styles not being properly handled when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', leading to incorrect marker fill behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly handle cases where the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' for custom marker styles.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Check for fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, I added a check for the `fillstyle` attribute to determine if the marker should be filled or not. If the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `filled` attribute will be set to `False`.

This change should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, ensuring that custom markers with `fillstyle='none'` behave as expected.
