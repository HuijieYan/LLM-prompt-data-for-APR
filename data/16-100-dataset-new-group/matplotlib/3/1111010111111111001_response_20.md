The cause of the bug is in the `_recache` function, where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` unconditionally. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `False` when it should return `True`. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` if the value of `self._fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`, which resolves the issue. This should make the failing test pass.
