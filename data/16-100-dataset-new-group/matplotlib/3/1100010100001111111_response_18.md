The issue appears to be related to the markers not appearing as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' using the markers.MarkerStyle in the ax.scatter() function. This is likely due to the buggy _recache function not setting the _filled attribute to False when the fillstyle is 'none'. 

To fix this issue, we need to update the _recache function to correctly handle the fillstyle and set the _filled attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a conditional statement to check the fillstyle and set the _filled attribute accordingly, we can ensure that the marker will appear as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub report and ensures that the markers appear as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' using markers.MarkerStyle in the ax.scatter() function.
