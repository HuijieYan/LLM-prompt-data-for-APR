The issue seems to be that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` instead of the expected value of `True`. This is likely causing the `is_filled()` method to return `False` when it should return `True`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding an `if` statement to check the value of `self._fillstyle`, we can set the `_filled` attribute accordingly and ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value.
