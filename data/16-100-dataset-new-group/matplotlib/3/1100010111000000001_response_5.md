The problem with the _recache function is that it is not properly setting the fill style of the marker. The failing test is trying to create a MarkerStyle object with marker='o' and fillstyle='none', and then checking whether the fill style is set to 'none' and whether it is filled.

To fix this bug, we need to add a statement to set the fill style of the marker to the value provided in the MarkerStyle object.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if hasattr(self, "_fillstyle"):  # Check if fill style is provided in the MarkerStyle object
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled to True if fill style is not 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the _recache function will now properly set the fill style of the marker, and the failing test should pass.
