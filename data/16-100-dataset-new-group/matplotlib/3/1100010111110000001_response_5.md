The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute, which is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` instead of `False` when it should be checking for the 'none' fillstyle.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided, and the failing test should now pass.
