## Fixing the bug
The issue is that the `_recache` function is setting `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, even when `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`. This is causing the markers to always be filled, which is not the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to update `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `_recache` function will now correctly set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, which resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
