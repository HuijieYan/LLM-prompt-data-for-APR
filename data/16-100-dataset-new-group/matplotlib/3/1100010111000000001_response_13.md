## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with test code

The buggy function _recache is called in the test_marker_fillstyle test case. The purpose of _recache is to recalculate and reinitialize marker properties. The bug is likely related to how the marker properties are being reinitialized inside the _recache function.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error could be in the way the marker properties are being reinitialized in the _recache function. If there's a problem with how the marker function is called or how the properties are being reset, it could lead to unexpected behavior when the function is used in a test case.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test

The failing test test_marker_fillstyle checks if the marker style fillstyle is set to 'none' and if the marker is not filled. The bug in the _recache function could be causing the MarkerStyle object to have its fillstyle incorrectly initialized, leading to the test failure.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the _recache function correctly resets the marker properties in a way that aligns with the expected behavior in the test cases. Additionally, ensuring that the marker function is called in a way that accurately updates the marker properties would be important for resolving the bug.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Use "is not None" instead of "is None"
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):  # Check if _marker_function is callable before calling
            self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, we have added an extra check to ensure that the _marker_function is callable before calling it. We also modified the first condition to use "is not None" instead of "is None" for better clarity. This should address the issues and align the function behavior with the expected behavior in the test cases.
