The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly setting the marker to be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to assert that the marker is not filled, which fails.

The issue on GitHub also confirms that setting `fillstyle='none'` is not resulting in a hollow marker as expected.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the line `self._filled = True`, which is setting the marker to be filled regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

The bug is caused by the `_recache` function unconditionally setting `self._filled` to `True`, overriding the effect of setting `fillstyle='none'`. This causes the failing test to assert that the marker is filled, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to modify the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter and set `self._filled` accordingly. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the marker is hollow.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_recache` function checks the value of `self._fillstyle`. If it is equal to `'none'`, then `self._filled` is set to `False` to ensure that the marker is hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
