To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `self._filled` attribute will be set to `False` when `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, which will result in hollow markers as expected. This will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` passes as well.
