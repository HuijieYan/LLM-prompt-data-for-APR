The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to return `True` instead of `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is causing the failing test to raise an `AssertionError`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This prevents the `is_filled` method from correctly returning `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to conditionally set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this updated `_recache` function, the `is_filled` method should now correctly return `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none', which will cause the failing test to pass. Additionally, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved with this fix.
