The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the conditional check `if self._marker_function is None`. It should be `if self._marker_function is not None`. This causes the function to not execute `_marker_function` when it should.

Here's the fixed version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the fixed version, the conditional check has been changed to `if self._marker_function is not None`, ensuring that the `_marker_function` is executed when it is not None.

This change will prevent the bug by making sure that the `_marker_function` is executed when it is not None, addressing the issue of it not being called when it should be.
