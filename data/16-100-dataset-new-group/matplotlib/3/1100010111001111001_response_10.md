Based on the failing test and the provided values, it looks like the bug is in the line `self._filled = True`. Since the expected value is `True`, this line should be `self._filled = True` instead of `self._filled = False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
