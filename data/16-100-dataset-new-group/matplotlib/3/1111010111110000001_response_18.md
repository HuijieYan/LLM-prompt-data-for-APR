The `is_filled` method seems to not be behaving as expected in the failing test. The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is not updating the `_filled` attribute according to the `fillstyle` parameter. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should not.

To fix this bug, you need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. Also, ensure that the `marker_function` is properly defined to set the necessary attributes for the marker style.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    ...
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none' or self._fillstyle == 'full':
            self._filled = self._fillstyle == 'full'
        else:
            self._filled = True  # default to filled for any unsupported fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
``` 

In this corrected version, I added a condition to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none' or 'full', it will be set accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is unsupported, it will default to being filled.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
