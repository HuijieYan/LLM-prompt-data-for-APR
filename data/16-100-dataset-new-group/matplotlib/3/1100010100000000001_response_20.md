The buggy function `_recache` appears to reset some attributes and then calls a marker function. However, it seems like the `_marker_function` is called without any arguments. This could be a potential error location as the function might require some arguments to work properly.

The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` is called without passing any required arguments, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is called with the necessary arguments. This may involve analyzing the `_marker_function` and identifying the required inputs for it to work correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function(self)
```

In this corrected version, I have assumed that the `_marker_function` requires the instance `self` as an argument, and I have added it when calling the `_marker_function`. This should ensure that the function has access to the necessary attributes and methods of the instance. If the `_marker_function` requires additional arguments, they should be passed accordingly.
