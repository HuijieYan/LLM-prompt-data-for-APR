To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is called with the correct parameters and that it updates the relevant attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class.

The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the result of the `_marker_function` call.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # setting snap_threshold to infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function()  # update filled attribute based on marker function

```

In this corrected version, we update the `_filled` attribute by assigning the result of the `_marker_function` call. This ensures that the `_filled` attribute reflects the correct result from the marker function.

This correction should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test.
