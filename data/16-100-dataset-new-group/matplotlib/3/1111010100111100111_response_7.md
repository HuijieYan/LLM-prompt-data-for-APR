The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False`. This issue is causing the test case `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` to fail with an assertion error.

The bug is likely occurring in the line `self._filled = True` inside the `_recache` function, which is setting the `filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `filled` attribute reflects the value of the `_fillstyle` attribute. If the `_fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then the `filled` attribute should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` attribute. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test case pass.
