The issue seems to be related to the MarkerStyle class' _recache method, which is not correctly updating the is_filled attribute when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The buggy function _recache in the MarkerStyle class sets the _filled attribute to True unconditionally, regardless of the fillstyle attribute. This causes the is_filled method to return True even when the fillstyle is set to 'none', resulting in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the _recache method should be modified to correctly update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter. Additionally, the is_filled method should return the correct value based on the updated _filled attribute.

Here's a corrected version of the _recache method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none' and update filled attribute accordingly
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass as the is_filled method will now correctly return False when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This fix should also address the issue reported on GitHub, where the markers were not appearing hollow when the markers.MarkerStyle's fillstyle was set to 'none'.
