The potential error location within the _recache function is the line: 
```python
self._filled = True
```

The cause of the bug is that the _filled variable is set to True, which is incorrect when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The failing test is expecting the is_filled() method to return False when the fillstyle is set to 'none', but it is currently returning True, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the _filled variable should be set based on the fillstyle parameter when creating the MarkerStyle object.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ('full', 'left', 'right'):
        self._filled = True
    elif self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a conditional statement to determine the value of self._filled based on the fillstyle parameter, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass.
