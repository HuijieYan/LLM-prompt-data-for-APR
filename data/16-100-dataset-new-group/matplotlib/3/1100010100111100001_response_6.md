The bug in the function `_recache` is causing the `is_filled` method to return the incorrect value, leading to a failing test.

The bug is likely located in the line `self._filled = True`. This line should not set `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, as it is overwriting the fill style set in the `MarkerStyle` object.

The bug is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` instead of the expected value, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the fill style set in the `MarkerStyle` object. We can achieve this by modifying the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style passed to the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ('full', 'left', 'right'):
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
