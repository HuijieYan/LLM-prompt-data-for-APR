The cause of the bug is that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should return `False` based on the input parameters and the current state of the `MarkerStyle` object. This is likely due to incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` method.

To fix the bug, initialize the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass as the `is_filled()` method will return `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.
