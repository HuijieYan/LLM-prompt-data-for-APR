## A corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = None
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

## Explanation:

### Analysis
The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the matplotlib library. It is designed to recache marker properties, but it has several issues with setting the correct values for certain attributes.

### Potential error locations
1. Setting self._path to _empty_path instead of None.
2. Setting self._snap_threshold to None instead of float('inf').

### Cause of the bug
The bug causes incorrect marker properties to be set, resulting in markers not appearing as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made:
1. Set self._path to None instead of _empty_path.
2. Set self._snap_threshold to float('inf').

By making these changes, the function will correctly recache the marker properties and display hollow markers when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and ensures that the expected input/output values are satisfied.
