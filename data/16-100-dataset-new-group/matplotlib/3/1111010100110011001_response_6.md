## The buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class
The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the class `MarkerStyle`. It is responsible for resetting certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance to their default values and then calling the `_marker_function` method if it is not None.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The bug may be related to the `_filled` attribute not being set to the correct value.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is causing the `is_filled` method to return the incorrect value. This is likely because the `_filled` attribute is not being properly set within the `_recache` function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is being properly set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # set snap_threshold to infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # set filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle`, and the failing test should pass.
