The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which results in the `is_filled` method returning `True` regardless of the actual fillstyle. This causes the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter of the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the `is_filled` method should return the correct value, allowing the failing test to pass.
