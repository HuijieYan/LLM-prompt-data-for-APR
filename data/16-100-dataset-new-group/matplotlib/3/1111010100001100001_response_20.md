The buggy function `_recache` is not properly handling the case where `self._marker_function` is None. It should not attempt to call the function in this case.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to add a check to see if `self._marker_function` is None before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will only attempt to call `self._marker_function` if it is not None, preventing the error caused by trying to call a None object.
