The buggy function is causing an issue in the `test_marker_fillstyle` test. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This suggests that the `self._filled` attribute is not being set correctly within the `_recache` function.

Looking at the buggy function, we can see that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally. This is likely the cause of the issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of `fillstyle`, and the `test_marker_fillstyle` test should pass without any issues.
