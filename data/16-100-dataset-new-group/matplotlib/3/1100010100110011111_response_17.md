## Fixing the bug

The bug seems to be in the _recache function where the _filled variable is always being set to True, causing the is_filled function to return False even when fillstyle='none' is selected.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to properly set the _filled variable based on the fillstyle parameter.

The corrected version of the function should correctly set the _filled variable based on the fillstyle parameter, and ensure that the is_filled function returns the correct value.


## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Set the _filled variable based on the fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _recache function to correctly set the _filled variable based on the fillstyle parameter, the bug should be fixed. This will ensure that the is_filled function returns the correct value and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
