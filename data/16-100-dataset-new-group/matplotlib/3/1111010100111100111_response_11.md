Based on the error message and the runtime values, it seems that the issue lies in the `is_filled` method within the `MarkerStyle` class. The `is_filled` method is always returning `True` instead of checking the value of the `_filled` variable.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `is_filled` method to return the value of the `_filled` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self._filled = fillstyle != 'none'

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
