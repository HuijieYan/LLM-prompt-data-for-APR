To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to ensure that the `_path` variable is properly assigned a Path object and the `self._marker_function()` is called correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `_path` variable is being assigned to a placeholder `_empty_path` instead of an actual Path object. Additionally, the `self._marker_function()` is being called without properly assigning the returned value to the `_path` variable.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function()` returns a valid Path object and assign it to the `_path` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = self._marker_function()
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

With this correction, the function should now properly assign the returned Path object to the `_path` variable and should satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the failing test case.
