The issue lies in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally. This is conflicting with the intended behavior of setting `fillstyle='none'` in the `MarkerStyle` object.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing the `MarkerStyle` object to behave as intended. This should resolve the failing test and the issue posted in GitHub.
