## Explanation
The bug is caused by the `_filled` variable being set to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the input `self._fillstyle` value. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the `self._fillstyle` value. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the markers are hollow.

## The corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, we added a conditional statement to set the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. Otherwise, `_filled` is set to `True` to indicate a filled marker.
