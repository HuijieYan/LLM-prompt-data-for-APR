## A corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = Affine2D()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
In the original buggy function, the "_transform" attribute is set to "IdentityTransform()" which may be inappropriate for the "fillstyle='none'" setting. Changing it to "Affine2D()" should help resolve this issue.

The "_snap_threshold" attribute is set to "None", changing it to "float('inf')" ensures that it is set to infinity as expected.

The "_filled" attribute is set to "True", changing it to "False" corresponds to the desired behavior when "fillstyle='none'" is used.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
