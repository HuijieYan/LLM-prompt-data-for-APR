## Potential Error Location
The bug may be in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. Specifically, the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the `is_filled` method to always return True, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the unconditional setting of the `_filled` attribute to `True` in the `_recache` function, which overrides the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, leading to the failing test and the undesired behavior mentioned in the GitHub Issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should take into account the `fillstyle` parameter and appropriately set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`. Additionally, the `is_filled` method should return the correct value based on the `_filled` attribute.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Check fillstyle and set _filled accordingly
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is assigned based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is not 'none', then `_filled` is set to `True`, otherwise, it is set to `False`. This ensures that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
