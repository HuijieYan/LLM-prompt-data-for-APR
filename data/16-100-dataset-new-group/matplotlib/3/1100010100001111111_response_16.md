The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue. The expected behavior is that when using `fillstyle='none'`, the markers should be hollow.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to allow the markers to be hollow.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the markers will behave as expected, and the issue posted on GitHub will be resolved.
