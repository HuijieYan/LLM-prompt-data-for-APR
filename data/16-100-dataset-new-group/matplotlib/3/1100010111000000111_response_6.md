Since the issue is related to the fillstyle not being properly set to 'none', we can identify the potential cause of the bug in the buggy function as the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute.

The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, which causes the markers to be filled instead of hollow, even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

To fix this bug, we can update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ('full', 'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top'):
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the function will ensure that markers are rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

This fix will address the issue reported in the GitHub post and make the markers hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none', as demonstrated in the provided test case.
