The buggy function is a method called `_recache` and belongs to the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. This function is used to reset the marker's path and transformations.

Based on the provided code, the potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The if statement `if self._marker_function is None` may not be checking the correct attribute.
2. The line `self._marker_function()` is trying to call a method or function without checking if it exists.

The potential cause of the bug is that the function is not checking if `_mark_function` exists and is directly trying to call it, which may result in an AttributeError if the attribute does not exist.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to first check if `_marker_function` exists and is callable before attempting to call it. This can be done using Python's built-in `callable()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # Handle the case when _marker_function is not callable
        # Add appropriate error handling or logging here
        pass
```
In the corrected version, we first check if `_marker_function` is callable using the `callable()` function. If it is callable, we proceed to reset the marker's attributes and then call the `_marker_function`. If it is not callable, appropriate error handling or logging can be added as needed.
