## Fixing the bug

The bug appears to be in the `_recache` function, where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the failing test to assert that `not True`, leading to the error. To fix this, the `_filled` attribute should be set according to the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self.get_fillstyle() != 'none' else False
    self._marker_function()
```
This fix ensures that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` if the `fillstyle` is not `none`, and `False` otherwise.

With this change, the failing test should pass, and the marker should be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `none`.

The corrected function addresses the issue posted on GitHub, as it resolves the problem of markers not being hollow when using `scatter` and setting the `fillstyle` to 'none'.
