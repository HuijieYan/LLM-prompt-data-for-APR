To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` when the fill style is set to `'none'`. This can be achieved by modifying the `_recache` function to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on the fill style
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style, the function will now correctly set the filled attribute to `True` when the fill style is not 'none'. This change ensures that the test case `test_marker_fillstyle` will pass and that the expected input/output values will be satisfied.
