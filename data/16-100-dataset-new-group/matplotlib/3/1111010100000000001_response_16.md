The buggy function _recache has a bug in the line where it calls self._marker_function(). The issue is that it is calling _marker_function without checking if it exists or not, which may cause an AttributeError if _marker_function is not defined.

To fix this bug, we can use a try-except block to check if self._marker_function exists before calling it. If it does not exist, we can simply return from the function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        try:
            if self._marker_function is None:
                return
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
        except AttributeError:
            return
```

With this fix, the buggy function will safely check for the existence of self._marker_function before calling it, preventing any potential AttributeError.
