## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = None  # Changed to set _path to None
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is 'none' and set _filled accordingly
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should now properly handle the case where `fillstyle` is set to 'none' and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` passes successfully.
