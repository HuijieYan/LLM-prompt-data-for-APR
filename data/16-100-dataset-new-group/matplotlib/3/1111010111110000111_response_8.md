## The cause of the bug:

The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the value for the `_filled` attribute, which is resulting in the failing test. When the fillstyle is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute should be `False`, indicating that the marker is hollow. However, the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be returning `False`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The `_filled` attribute should be set based on the fillstyle provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. If the fillstyle is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the provided fillstyle, resolving the bug and causing the failing test to pass. This fix also addresses the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not appearing as hollow when the fillstyle was set to 'none'.
