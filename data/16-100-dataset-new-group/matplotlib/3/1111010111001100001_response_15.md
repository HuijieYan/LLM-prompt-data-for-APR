The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be related to the assignment of the `_filled` attribute. Based on the failing test case, the expected behavior is that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` the marker should not be filled (`_filled` should be `False`).

To fix this bug, we need to update the code to properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and set `_filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'full':  # Assuming 'full' is the default fillstyle
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function should now properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly, which will fix the failing test case.
