## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` sets the marker style attributes and then calls the `_marker_function`, which is supposed to update the marker path and potentially other attributes. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value.
The GitHub issue suggests that setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' does not create a hollow marker as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
- The `_marker_function` may not be updating the marker attributes correctly.
- There might be a bug in the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class.

## Cause of the Bug
The `_marker_function` is not updating the marker style attributes to reflect a hollow marker as requested in the GitHub issue. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False`.

## Suggested Fix Strategy
The `is_filled` method should check the `fillstyle` attribute and return `True` if it is not 'none'. Additionally, the `_marker_function` should be updated to correctly handle setting the fillstyle to 'none' to create a hollow marker.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
In the `MarkerStyle` class, add the following method:
```python
def is_filled(self):
    return self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
```
With this corrected version, the `_recache` function properly sets the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, and the `is_filled` method returns the expected value. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
