To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a conditional check to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, we ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the markers will be hollow as expected.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub, and the failing test case should now pass as well.
