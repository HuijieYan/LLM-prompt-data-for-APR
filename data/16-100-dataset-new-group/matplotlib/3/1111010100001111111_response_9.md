### Analysis
The `_recache` function seems to be setting some default values to certain attributes of the MarkerStyle class. However, in the provided runtime values and types, it can be seen that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` instead of the expected value of `True`. This discrepancy is likely causing the markers to not appear as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Potential Error Location
The line `self._filled = True` inside the `_recache` function seems to be setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected values.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the markers to not appear as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is due to the incorrect assignment of the `_filled` attribute inside the `_recache` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` only when the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`. Otherwise, it should be set to `False`.

### Bug Fix
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```
By modifying the line `self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'`, we set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`, ensuring it is `False` when `fillstyle` is `'none'` and `True` otherwise. This corrected version should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output values.
