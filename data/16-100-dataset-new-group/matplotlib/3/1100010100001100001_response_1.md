The cause of the bug in the function `_recache` is that the `_filled` variable is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, regardless of the input parameters. This is causing an inconsistency in the filled status of the marker.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to use the value of `self._fillstyle` to determine the value of `_filled` instead of setting it unconditionally to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By using the value of `self._fillstyle` to determine the value of `_filled`, we ensure that the filled status of the marker is consistent with the input parameters, and the bug is fixed.
