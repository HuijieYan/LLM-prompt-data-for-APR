## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

The bug is caused by not properly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` input. The function should set `_filled` to `True` when `fillstyle` is not 'none', otherwise it should be set to `False`.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to add a condition that checks if the `fillstyle` is not 'none' and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

I have added the conditional statement in the corrected version above, which will set `_filled` to `True` based on the value of `fillstyle`. This should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
