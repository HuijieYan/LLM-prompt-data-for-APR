## The buggy function

The buggy function is the `_recache` method inside the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Analysis
1. The `_recache` method is supposed to reset the marker's path and transformation attributes to their default values and then call the `_marker_function`.
2. The input parameter `self._fillstyle` seems to be irrelevant to the function's logic as it is not used within the function.

### Bug 
The bug is that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` instead of `True`, regardless of the input parameters.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` as the expected behavior, and ensure that the function is correctly handling the input parameters.

### The corrected version

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Fixed the bug by setting _filled to True
        self._marker_function()
```

By setting `_filled` to `True`, the bug causing the markers to not be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` is resolved.
