The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is trying to call a function `_marker_function` without checking if it's defined. This can lead to a `NoneType` object has no attribute error.

To fix this, we can check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will only call the `_marker_function` if it exists, preventing the NoneType attribute error.
