The potential error in the buggy function is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` unconditionally, which would override the fillstyle parameter if it happens to be set to `'none'`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` regardless of the `fillstyle` specified, which results in the marker not appearing as hollow as intended.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the `fillstyle` specified. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class will correctly honor the `fillstyle` parameter, so that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will appear as hollow. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
