The issue in the buggy function `_recache` is that the `self._marker_function` is being called without checking if it exists. This results in a `NoneType` object being called as a function, which causes an error.

To fix the bug, we should first check if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function exists
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function should no longer throw an error and should pass the failing test.
