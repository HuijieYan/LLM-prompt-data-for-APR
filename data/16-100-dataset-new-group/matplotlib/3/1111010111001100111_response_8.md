# The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = None  # Change to None instead of _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Change to False instead of True
        self._marker_function()
```

## Explanation:
The issue is caused by incorrect settings in the `_recache` function. The initial path is set to `_empty_path` and the filled parameter is set to True, which results in the markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

To fix this issue, the `_path` should be set to None instead of `_empty_path`, and the `_filled` parameter should be set to False instead of True.

By making these changes, the MarkerStyle should correctly create hollow markers when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

These changes will address the problem reported in the GitHub issue, allowing users to create hollow markers as intended.
