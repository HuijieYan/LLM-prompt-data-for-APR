The buggy function `_recache` does not properly handle the case where `self._marker_function` is `None`. It tries to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists, which can lead to errors.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will only call `self._marker_function()` if it is not `None`, which should resolve the issue with the failing test.
