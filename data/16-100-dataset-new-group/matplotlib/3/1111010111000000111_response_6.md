The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class does not correctly handle the case when `self._marker_function` is not None. This can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to create markers with hollow fillstyle.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` verifies that when creating a `MarkerStyle` with fillstyle set to 'none', the `get_fillstyle` method should return 'none' and `is_filled` should return False.

The GitHub issue reports that when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to ensure that the appropriate marker function is called when the marker is being recached. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Updated condition to check if marker function is not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function
```

With this fix, the marker function will be called correctly when the marker is recached, ensuring that the correct marker style is applied.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should now pass.
