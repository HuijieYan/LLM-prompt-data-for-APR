The issue here is that the `_recache` function does not correctly set the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This leads to the markers not being hollow as expected.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_recache` function to check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False` when `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, and the markers should appear as hollow as expected. This will address the issue reported on GitHub as well.
