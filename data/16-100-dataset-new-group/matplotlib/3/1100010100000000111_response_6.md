## Analysis
The issue reported on GitHub is that when setting the `fillstyle` of the `MarkerStyle` to `'none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
Based on the reported issue and the provided function, the potential error location could be in the `_recache` function where the attributes related to the marker's appearance are assigned, specifically the `_filled` attribute.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function does not correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute when creating custom marker styles. This results in the markers not being hollow as expected.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute when creating custom marker styles. This may involve checking the value of `fillstyle` and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Checking fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```
