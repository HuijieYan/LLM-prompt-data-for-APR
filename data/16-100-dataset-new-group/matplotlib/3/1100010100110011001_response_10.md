The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the `is_filled` method to return an unexpected value, resulting in a failing test.

The issue appears to be with the assignment of the `_filled` attribute within the `_recache` function. The function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, regardless of whether the marker should be filled or not. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should not.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should take into account the fillstyle of the marker and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the fillstyle of the marker, and the failing test should pass.

The corrected `_recache` function now takes the fillstyle of the marker into account and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the expected value based on the fillstyle of the marker.
