The buggy function `_recache` sets certain attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`. However, it seems that the expected behavior is not being met when the function is called with specific input parameters.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the assignments of default values to the attributes and the call to `_marker_function`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` is not being properly handled and may not be setting the expected values for the attributes. As a result, the expected values for the attributes are not being met.

A strategy for fixing the bug could be to ensure that the `_marker_function` sets the appropriate values for the attributes and that these values are correctly updated before the function returns.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function checks if the `_marker_function` is not `None` before setting the attributes to default values and calling the `_marker_function`. This should ensure that the expected values for the attributes are set appropriately before the function returns.
