The issue appears to be with the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is expected to return the fill status of the marker, but it is not returning the correct value. This is likely related to the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class not properly setting the fill status.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` method properly sets the fill status of the marker.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = Affine2D()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set the filled status based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly set the `_filled` status based on the value of the `_fillstyle`.

This change should address the bug and ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value, resolving the failing test.
