## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. It is intended to recache the marker properties, but it appears to have an issue with the `is_filled` method, which is causing the failing test and the reported issue on GitHub.

The failing test is checking if `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `False`, but it is actually returning `True`, which is causing the assertion error. This indicates that the `is_filled` method is not working as intended.

The GitHub issue reports the same problem, where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely located within the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect implementation of the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, even when `fillstyle='none'` is set, leading to the failing test and the reported issue on GitHub.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `is_filled` method needs to be updated to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and return the correct value based on the fill style set for the marker.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker_function = None  # Assuming this is set elsewhere
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle  # Store fill style

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled property based on fill style
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self.fillstyle != 'none'  # Return True if fillstyle is not 'none'

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self.fillstyle
```

In the corrected version, the `is_filled` method has been updated to return `True` only if the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`, and the `get_fillstyle` method has been added to access the `fillstyle` attribute if needed. This should resolve the failing test and the reported issue on GitHub.
