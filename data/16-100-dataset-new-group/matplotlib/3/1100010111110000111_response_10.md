## The analysis of the bug

The `_recache` function in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` seems to be responsible for caching marker properties, including the fill style. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tries to create a marker with the fill style set to 'none' using the `MarkerStyle` class and then checks if it is not filled. However, the test fails with an assertion error.

The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning True when it is expected to return False. This suggests that the marker is being filled despite the fill style being set to 'none'.

The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where the user is trying to create hollow markers, but it doesn't work as expected when using `ax.scatter()` and `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'`.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

The issue seems to be related to the `_recache` function not handling the fill style correctly. It's likely that the call to `_marker_function()` inside `_recache` is causing the marker to be filled regardless of the fill style set.

## Cause of the bug

The cause of the bug appears to be the `_recache` function not correctly applying the fill style set in the `MarkerStyle` class, resulting in markers being filled when they should be hollow.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the fill style property. This may involve modifying how the fill style is applied to the marker path and transform when the `_marker_function` is called.

## The corrected version of the function

After analyzing the bug, here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled property based on the fill style
    self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, the `_recache` function now updates the `_filled` property based on the fill style set in the `MarkerStyle` class. This change ensures that the marker is filled only when the fill style is not 'none', addressing the bug identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
