The bug in the _recache function is causing the is_filled method of the MarkerStyle object to return True when it should be returning False. This indicates that the _recache function is not properly setting the _filled attribute to False.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the _filled attribute is set to False in the _recache function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Setting _filled to False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will properly set the _filled attribute to False, and the failing test should pass.
