## Correction

### Analysis
The `_recache` function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` value. This causes the `is_filled()` method to always return `True`, leading to the failing test. The GitHub issue also confirms that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function always setting `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` value.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should take into account the `fillstyle` value and set `_filled` accordingly.

### The corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
By modifying the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` value, the bug is fixed. This corrected version should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
