## The buggy function

The `_recache` function in `markers.py` is responsible for resetting the marker's properties. The failing test is testing the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, and it is failing with the assertion error.

## Potential error locations
The `_recache` function reassigns several properties of the marker, and the issue might be with the reassignment of the filled property.

## Cause of the bug
The failing test is trying to assert that `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `False`. However, it is currently returning `True`. This indicates that the marker is being filled even though the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to properly handle the `filled` property when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This involves updating the logic in that function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self.get_fillstyle() != 'none' else False
    self._marker_function()
```

The corrected version checks the `fillstyle` parameter and sets the `_filled` property accordingly. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled.
