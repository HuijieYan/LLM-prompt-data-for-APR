The buggy function is intended to set certain attributes to their default values and then call a marker function that is stored in the `_marker_function` attribute. However, the function fails to set the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which is causing the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` so that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value in the test.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Set _filled attribute to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the test case should pass and the `_filled` attribute will be set to `True` as expected.
