The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of what the current fill style is, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the current fill style. If the fill style is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on the fill style
    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the `_filled` attribute will be set according to the current fill style, and the failing test should pass.

This fix will also address the issue reported on GitHub where setting the fill style to 'none' does not produce hollow markers.
