## Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to handle marker attributes, but it is currently not working correctly. It sets some attributes unconditionally and then calls a marker function, but the marker function is not defined in the provided code.

## Identified potential error locations
1. The `_marker_function` is potentially not defined or assigned incorrectly.
2. The default values for `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` are being set unconditionally, even if they were previously set by the user.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the unconditional assignment of attributes and the call to an undefined marker function in the `_recache` function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Define or fix the `_marker_function` to have a proper implementation.
2. Change the unconditional assignments to conditional ones, so that they only apply if the attributes have not been set by the user.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            if self._joinstyle is None:
                self._joinstyle = 'round'
            if self._capstyle is None:
                self._capstyle = 'butt'
            if self._filled:
                self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
In this corrected version:
- The condition to check if `_marker_function` is not None is added before calling it.
- The default assignments for `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` are changed to conditional assignments, so they only apply if the attributes have not been set by the user.
