The buggy function is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute to True, which is causing the `is_filled()` method to return False, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute to True before calling the `_marker_function`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # setting snap_threshold to infinity
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # setting filled attribute to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function should properly set the `_filled` attribute to True, and the failing test should pass.
