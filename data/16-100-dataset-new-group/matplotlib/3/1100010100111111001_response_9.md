To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we observe that the `self._filled` is being set to `False` instead of `True`. This is the cause of the failure in the test case.

To fix this, we need to set `self._filled` to `True` before calling `self._marker_function()`, which is the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
