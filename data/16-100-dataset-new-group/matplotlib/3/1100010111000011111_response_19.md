The potential error location in the buggy function is that it sets `_filled` to `True` regardless of the value of `fillstyle` in the `MarkerStyle` object.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which means that even if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will still be filled.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` of the `MarkerStyle` object and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` of the `MarkerStyle` object, resolving the issue where markers were not appearing as hollow when `fillstyle` was set to `'none'`.
