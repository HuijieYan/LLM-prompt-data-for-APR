The bug in the _recache function is causing the MarkerStyle to not be recognized as 'not filled' when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is evidenced by the failing test and the GitHub issue where the user expects the markers to be hollow when setting fillstyle to 'none', but they are not.

The cause of the bug is that the _marker_function is not properly setting the MarkerStyle as not filled when fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is why the assert not marker_style.is_filled() is failing in the test.

To fix the bug, the _marker_function needs to be modified to properly handle the case when fillstyle is set to 'none' and ensure that the MarkerStyle is recognized as not filled in this case.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
By adding a check for self._fillstyle and setting self._filled to False when fillstyle is 'none', we ensure that the MarkerStyle is recognized as not filled when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
