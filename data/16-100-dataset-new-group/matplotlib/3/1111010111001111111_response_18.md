The issue here is that when setting the `fillstyle` to 'none', the markers are not appearing hollow as expected. This is happening because the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` method so that it takes into account the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is 'none', and it will be set to `True` for any other `fillstyle`.

This should address the issue reported on GitHub and cause the failing test to pass.
