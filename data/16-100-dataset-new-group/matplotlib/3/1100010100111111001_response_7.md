The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This is causing the `MarkerStyle` to be incorrectly identified as not filled when it should be filled, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the `MarkerStyle` should correctly identify whether it is filled or not based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.
