### The analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, corresponding error message, the runtime input/output values, the expected input/output values, the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. It is responsible for setting the state of the marker style attributes. 

The error message from the failing test indicates that when the `MarkerStyle` object is created with the `fillstyle` set to 'none', the `is_filled` method returns `True`, which is not expected.

The runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function and the expected values and types show that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False`, which does not match the expected output.

The GitHub issue describes a situation where the `fillstyle` parameter is used to try to create a hollow marker, but the behavior observed is not as expected.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the setting of the `_filled` attribute to `True` irrespective of the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Explanation of the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the runtime input/output variable values, the expected input/output variable values, the GitHub Issue information

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, even if the `fillstyle` is 'none'. This leads to the `is_filled` method returning `True` when it is actually expected to return `False` for hollow markers.

The GitHub issue confirms that the expected behavior is to create hollow markers when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The strategy for fixing the bug would be to conditionally set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`. 

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` is set to `False`, otherwise it's set to `True`. This change ensures that the `is_filled` method will return the expected value.
