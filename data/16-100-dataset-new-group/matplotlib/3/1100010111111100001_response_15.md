The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not properly updating the `is_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object. This is causing the `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail with the error message `assert not True`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is properly updated to reflect the fill style of the marker.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on the fill style
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
