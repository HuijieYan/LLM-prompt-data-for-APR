The buggy function `_recache` is not setting the `_filled` attribute correctly, leading to the failing test and the corresponding error message. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the marker's fill style is correctly reflected, and the failing test should now pass.
