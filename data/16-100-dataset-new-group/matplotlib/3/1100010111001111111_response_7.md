## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Change this line to set _filled to False
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` regardless of the fillstyle being set to 'none' in the MarkerStyle. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior and the issue reported on GitHub.

By changing the line `self._filled = True` to `self._filled = False`, the function will now correctly reflect the fillstyle set in the MarkerStyle object and ensure that the markers are hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This will fix the bug and ensure that the markers are rendered as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none', as reported in the GitHub issue.
