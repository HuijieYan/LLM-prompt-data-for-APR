## The bug analysis
The _recache function sets the filled attribute to True unconditionally, which contradicts the intended behavior of the MarkerStyle class when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This causes the failing test for is_filled to return True when it should be False.

## Bug location
The bug is located in the _recache function where the _filled attribute is unconditionally set to True.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the _filled attribute is always set to True in the _recache function, regardless of the fillstyle set in the MarkerStyle class. This contradicts the expected behavior and causes the failing test.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to conditionally set the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle set in the MarkerStyle class. If the fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False. Otherwise, it should be set to True.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
