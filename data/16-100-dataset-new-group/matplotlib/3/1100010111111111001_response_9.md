The bug is within the `_recache` function, where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the actual fill style.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which leads to the failing test since the expected value of `_filled` should depend on the fill style.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the fill style and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the fill style, and the failing test should pass.
