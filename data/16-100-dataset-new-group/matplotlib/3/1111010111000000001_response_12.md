## Corrections to the Buggy Function

### 1. Analyze
The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file. This class is used to define the style of markers in matplotlib plots. The function aims to recache the marker style attributes when they are updated.

### 2. Potential Error Locations
The potential error in the `_recache` function may lie in the condition `if self._marker_function is None`, as well as the line `self._marker_function()`.

### 3. Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self._marker_function` will always exist and be callable. The failing test specifically sets the fillstyle of a marker to 'none', which may trigger the `_recache` function to run and encounter the issue.

### 4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by checking if `self._marker_function` exists and is callable before trying to execute it.

### 5. Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if hasattr(self, '_marker_function') and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            if self._marker_function:
                self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, an additional check is performed using `hasattr` and `callable` to ensure that `_marker_function` exists and is callable before invoking it. This prevents the function from being called with `None`, which fixes the bug and allows the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to pass.
