The bug in the function `_recache` seems to be related to the variable `_filled`. When the function is called, it sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, but it should instead be set to `False` if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to check the value of `fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

Now the function checks the value of `fillstyle` and sets `_filled` to `False` when it's equal to `'none'`. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
