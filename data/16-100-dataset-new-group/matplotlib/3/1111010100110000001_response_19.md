## Analysis
The `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for caching the marker properties. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result, which suggests that the `_recache` function is not setting the `_filled` attribute correctly.

## Potential Error Location
The error could be in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is being set.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not setting the `_filled` attribute based on the marker properties.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `_recache` function needs to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the marker properties such as the fill style.

## The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() != 'none':
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, the `_recache` function determines the value of the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the expected result, fixing the bug.
