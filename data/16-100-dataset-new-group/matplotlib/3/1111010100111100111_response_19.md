The bug in the function `_recache` is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be returning `False`. The bug is related to the `_filled` variable being set to `True` unconditionally.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` variable is set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` value. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` variable should be set based on the `fillstyle` value. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

This change ensures that the `_filled` variable is set based on the `fillstyle` value, allowing the `is_filled` method to return the correct result.
