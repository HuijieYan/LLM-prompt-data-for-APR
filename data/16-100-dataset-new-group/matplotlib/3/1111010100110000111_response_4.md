## Potential error locations
The potential error locations within the `_recache` function are the initialization of the `_filled` attribute and the call to the `_marker_function` method.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is causing the marker to not be hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'. This is because the `_filled` attribute is initialized to `True` in the `_recache` function, which is contradictory to the intention of making the marker hollow. Additionally, there is no implementation for the `is_filled` method, which is causing the failing test.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. Additionally, an `is_filled` method should be implemented to correctly determine if the marker is filled or not.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```
