The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` regardless of the input parameters, leading to the failing test because it expects the marker to not be filled when the `fillstyle` is set to "none".

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set according to the `fillstyle` input parameter. If `fillstyle` is "none", then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set according to the `fillstyle` input parameter, satisfying the expected behavior of the failing test.
