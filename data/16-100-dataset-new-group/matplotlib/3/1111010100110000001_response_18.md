## Analysis
The `MarkerStyle` class has a `_recache` method that is called to recalculate the marker style attributes. Within this method, there is a condition `if self._marker_function is None:` that checks if a marker function exists and immediately returns if it doesn't. This might be causing the marker not to be properly updated when the `_marker_function` is not None. 

## Error Locations
The issue is likely to be with the `if self._marker_function is None:` condition where the function immediately returns if the marker function is None.

## Bug Cause
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` function is not returning the expected value, and this is likely occurring because the `_recache` method does not properly recache the marker function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the condition `if self._marker_function is None:` to actually execute the marker function even when it's not None. This ensures that the marker style attributes are properly updated.

## The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():


    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Modified condition
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()  # Always execute the marker function

    def is_filled(self):  # Example implementation of the function
        return self._filled
```

With this correction, the `_marker_function` will always be executed when the `_recache` method is called, ensuring that the marker style attributes are properly updated. This should resolve the assertion error from the failing test.
