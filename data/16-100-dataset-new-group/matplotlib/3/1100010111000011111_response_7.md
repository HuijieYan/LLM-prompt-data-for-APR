The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function does not properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter, which is not being set or checked within the function. This causes the marker to always be filled, even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter by checking its value and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ('full', 'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top'):
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check for `fillstyle` and setting the `_filled` attribute based on its value, the corrected function should now handle the `fillstyle` parameter correctly.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and also satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test case.
