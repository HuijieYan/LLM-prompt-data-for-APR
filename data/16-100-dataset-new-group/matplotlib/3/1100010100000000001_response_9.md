## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `_marker_function` may not be defined or may not be callable, causing an error when trying to call it.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not check if `_marker_function` is defined and callable before calling it. This can lead to a `TypeError` or `AttributeError` if `_marker_function` is not properly defined.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is defined and callable before trying to execute it.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = Affine2D()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # handle the case where _marker_function is not defined or not callable
        pass
```
