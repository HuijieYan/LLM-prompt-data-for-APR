## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. It is responsible for setting various attributes like `_path`, `_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, and so on. The error message indicates that when trying to check if the marker is filled or not using `is_filled`, it returns `True` when it should not.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue seems to be related to the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. Since the `_recache` method sets the `_filled` attribute to `True`, it could be the culprit.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` method is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally. As a result, when the `is_filled` method is called, it always returns `True`, even if the fillstyle has been set to 'none', which should mean the marker is not filled.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, you need to modify the `_recache` method to consider the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## Bug Fix
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Check if fillstyle is 'none' and set _filled accordingly
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is 'none', allowing the `is_filled` method to return the correct result. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
