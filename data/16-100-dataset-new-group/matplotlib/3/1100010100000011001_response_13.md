## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if the marker function is not None
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Set snap_threshold to infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it does not check if the marker function is not None before calling it. This can lead to an error if the marker function is not defined. Additionally, the expected value for `_snap_threshold` is `inf` (infinity) which is a float type, so it should be set using `float('inf')`.

By adding a check for `self._marker_function is not None` and setting `_snap_threshold` to `float('inf')`, we ensure that the marker function is only called when it is defined and that the snap threshold is correctly set to infinity.

With the corrected version of the function, it will satisfy all the expected input/output values.
