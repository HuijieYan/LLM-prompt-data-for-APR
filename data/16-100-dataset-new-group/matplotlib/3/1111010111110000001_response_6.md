The buggy function is `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class. The function sets various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance, and then calls the `_marker_function` method, which is likely intended to update the marker function.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` instance with a specified marker and fillstyle, and then checks if the fillstyle is correctly set and if the marker is not filled.

The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should not be.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function does not properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle. This is likely because the `_marker_function` method is not properly updating the `_filled` attribute.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, independently of the `_marker_function`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the fillstyle, and the failing test should pass.
