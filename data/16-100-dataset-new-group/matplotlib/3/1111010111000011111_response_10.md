The issue in the buggy function is that when the marker function is called, it does not properly handle the fillstyle parameter and always fills the markers. This results in the markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that the markers are not filled when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With the corrected function, the markers will be properly rendered as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' as expected. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
