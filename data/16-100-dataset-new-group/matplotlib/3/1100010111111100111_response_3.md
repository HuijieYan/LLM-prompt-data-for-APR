The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the failing test because it is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` attribute. The `_recache` function is not updating the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute, which causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False`. This leads to the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` function should update the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will correctly update the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, and the failing test should pass.

This fix should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub where the markers were not hollow when `fillstyle` was set to `'none'` in `markers.MarkerStyle`.
