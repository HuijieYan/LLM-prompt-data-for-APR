## Correction

The issue here is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which should be set to `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This causes the markers not to be rendered as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check for `fillstyle`, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set correctly based on the input `fillstyle` parameter.

This updated function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and as a result, the markers will be rendered as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none', resolving the GitHub issue and passing the failing test.
