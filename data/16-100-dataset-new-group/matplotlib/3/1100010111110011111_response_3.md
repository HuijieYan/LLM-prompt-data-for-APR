## A corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = None  # Change from _empty_path to None
    self._transform = Affine2D()  # Change from IdentityTransform to Affine2D
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Change from None to infinity
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Change from True to False
    self._marker_function()
```
With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and fulfill the expected input/output values. It will also resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
