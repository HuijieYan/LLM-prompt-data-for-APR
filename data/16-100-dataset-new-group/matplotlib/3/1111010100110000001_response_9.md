## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is attempting to call the `_marker_function`, but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This is likely the cause of the failing test, where the `is_filled` method is being called and returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_marker_function` not being defined, so when it is called in the `_recache` function it does nothing and the properties of the `MarkerStyle` class are left in an incorrect state.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to define the `_marker_function` and ensure that it sets the appropriate properties of the `MarkerStyle` class.

## The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
