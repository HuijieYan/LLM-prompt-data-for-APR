## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_recache` is related to the issue posted on GitHub where the user is unable to create hollow markers using `ax.scatter()`. The user is trying to set the `fillstyle` parameter to `'none'` in a custom `MarkerStyle` but is not getting the intended result.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the `_recache` function is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which may be conflicting with the user's attempt to create hollow markers.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the GitHub Issue information
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being unconditionally set to `True` in the `_recache` function. This conflicts with the user's attempt to create hollow markers by setting `fillstyle` to `'none'`. The `_recache` function needs to be modified to allow for custom modification of the fillstyle.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the `_recache` function to also take into account the fillstyle set by the user. This can be achieved by checking the `fillstyle` when the custom `MarkerStyle` is being used.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Check the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```
