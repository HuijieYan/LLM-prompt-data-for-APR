Based on the error message and the failing test, it appears that the is_filled() method is returning the incorrect value. This suggests that the _filled attribute is not being set correctly within the _recache() function. Looking at the expected values and types, it seems that the _filled attribute should be set to True, but it's currently being set to False in the buggy function.

To fix this bug, we need to update the _filled attribute to True inside the _recache() function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Update _filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the _filled attribute to True, the failing test should now pass and the custom MarkerStyle should correctly render the markers as hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting fillstyle to 'none'.

This fix should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub about markers not being hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting fillstyle to 'none'.
