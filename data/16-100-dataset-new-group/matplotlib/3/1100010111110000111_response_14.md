## The corrected version

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    if self._transform is None:
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._filled is None:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original code is that it doesn't properly check if `_transform` and `_filled` are None before setting them to a default value. This causes issues when the `MarkerStyle` is created with specific parameters.

The corrected version checks if `_transform` and `_filled` are None before setting them to default values. This ensures that the parameters are only overwritten if they haven't been set already, fixing the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test.
