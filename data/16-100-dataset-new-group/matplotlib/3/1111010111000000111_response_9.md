## The bug
The bug occurs in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. When the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers are not appearing as hollow as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.

## Potential error locations
The issue may be occurring in the `_recache` method where the `marker_function` is being called.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` method. When `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the function should set `_filled` attribute to `False` instead of setting it to `True` as it currently is. This results in the markers not appearing as hollow when `ax.scatter()` is used.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the `_recache` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() not in ('none', 'full')
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that the markers appear hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
