It seems that the `is_filled()` method is not returning the expected boolean value when called in the failing test.

Looking at the `_recache` function, the `self._filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which may be causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should not.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, which is set in the `MarkerStyle` constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will now correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, and the failing test should pass successfully.
