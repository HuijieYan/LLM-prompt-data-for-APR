## The Bug
The `_recache` function is not correctly updating the marker's attributes based on the provided marker function. This results in the marker not being hollow as expected when using the `ax.scatter()` method with `fillstyle='none'`.

## Potential Error Location
The error is likely occurring in the `_recache` function where the marker attributes are being updated.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not properly updating the marker's attributes based on the provided marker function. This leads to the marker not being displayed as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

## Proposed Fix
The issue can be resolved by updating the `_recache` function to properly assign the marker function's output to the marker's attributes. Specifically, when setting `fillstyle='none'`, the function should ensure that the marker is displayed as hollow.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path, self._transform = self._marker_function()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function correctly updates the marker's attributes based on the provided marker function, ensuring that when `fillstyle='none'` is set, the marker is displayed as hollow.
