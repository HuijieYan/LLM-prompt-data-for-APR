## Analysis
The `_recache` function is called when the marker style needs to be recalculated. The issue on GitHub indicates that when setting the `fillstyle` to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected.

## Error location
The issue seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache` function. This may be causing the markers to be filled instead of hollow.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is hardcoded to `True` in the `_recache` function. This overrides the `fillstyle` set by the user and makes the markers filled instead of hollow.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute respects the `fillstyle` set by the user. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

## Corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
