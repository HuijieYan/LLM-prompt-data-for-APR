The bug in the function `_recache` is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to not pass. The function `_recache` is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be determined by the `fillstyle` attribute passed to the `MarkerStyle` object.

To fix the bug, we should update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version of the function will check the `fillstyle` attribute using the `get_fillstyle` method and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This change will ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.
