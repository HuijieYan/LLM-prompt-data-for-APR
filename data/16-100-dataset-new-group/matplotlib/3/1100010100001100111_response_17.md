The bug is in the `_recache` function of the `markers.py` file in the `matplotlib` library. The function is not correctly handling the `self._filled` attribute when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This is causing markers to not appear as hollow even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute so that when it is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute is set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the markers should appear hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none' as expected, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
