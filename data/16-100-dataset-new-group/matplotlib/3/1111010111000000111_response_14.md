## The potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the `_recache` function are:

1. The `self._marker_function` is not being checked for validity before calling it.
2. The `self._filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter that may be passed.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not checking for the validity of `self._marker_function` before calling it and unconditionally setting `self._filled` to `True`. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to set markers to be hollow using the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.
2. Update the `_recache` function to set `self._filled` to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update to set filled based on fillstyle
            self._marker_function()
```
