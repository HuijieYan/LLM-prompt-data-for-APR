## The buggy function

The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file of the `lib/matplotlib` library is designed to update the properties of a marker. However, there is a bug in this function that results in incorrect behavior when a MarkerStyle with `fillstyle='none'` is used.

### Identify potential error locations
The potential error locations in the `_recache` function include the initialization of `self._filled` and the subsequent call to `self._marker_function()`.

### Explanation of the cause of the bug
The bug causes `self._filled` to always be set to `True`, regardless of the fillstyle specified. This leads to incorrect behavior when a MarkerStyle with `fillstyle='none'` is used, as it should result in a hollow marker. Additionally, the call to `self._marker_function()` is not conditioned on the fillstyle, so it may be calling the wrong transformation for certain cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `fillstyle='none'` case and ensure that the `self._filled` property reflects the correct value. Additionally, the `_marker_function` should be conditionally called based on the fillstyle.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check fillstyle and update filled property
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    # Conditionally call the marker function based on the fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._marker_function(unfilled=True)
    else:
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function properly handles the `fillstyle='none'` case, updates the `self._filled` property based on the fillstyle, and conditionally calls the marker function. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the MarkerStyle behaves as expected.
