## Analysis
The issue on GitHub is related to the markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' using the `ax.scatter()` function and a custom `markers.MarkerStyle`. The provided buggy function is related to the recaching of marker properties, but it does not directly address the issue identified on GitHub.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location within the function is the setting of the `_filled` property to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` property is being set to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter specified for the marker. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_filled` property should be set based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False` in order to make the marker hollow.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```
