Based on the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be related to setting the markers to hollow using the `fillstyle='none'` paramter, which is not producing the expected result.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.
2. The `_marker_function` is being called without considering the `fillstyle`.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally, and the `_marker_function` being called without considering the `fillstyle`, which prevents the markers from being rendered as hollow.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `_filled` attribute to reflect the `fillstyle` parameter.
2. Call the `_marker_function` based on the `fillstyle` parameter to ensure correct rendering of the markers.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    if self._filled:
        self._marker_function()  # Call _marker_function only if filled
```
