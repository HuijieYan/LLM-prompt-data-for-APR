The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. It should update the marker style attributes whenever changes are made to the marker. However, there are a few potential error locations within this function:

1. The condition `if self._marker_function is None:` should be `if self._marker_function is not None:` in order to execute the code block if `_marker_function` is not `None`.
2. `self._marker_function()` is being called without checking if it exists or if it is a callable function, potentially leading to an error.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

To fix the bug, the function `_recache` should first check if `_marker_function` is not `None` and is callable before executing it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` and is callable before executing it. This will prevent potential errors and ensure that the function is called only when it is safe to do so.
