## Fixing the Bug

The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute.

## The Corrected Version

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute, we ensure that the `is_filled` method will return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub, where setting `fillstyle='none'` was not resulting in hollow markers as expected.
