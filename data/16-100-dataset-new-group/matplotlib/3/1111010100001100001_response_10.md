The bug seems to be related to the `_marker_function` not being called properly. Since we do not have the implementation of the `_marker_function` in the provided code, we can assume that the bug lies within the logic of calling this function.

Based on the runtime values, it seems that the `_filled` variable is being set to `False` regardless of the input parameter `self._fillstyle`. This could be a potential cause of the bug, as the `_filled` variable is not being directly influenced by the input parameter.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic of setting the `_filled` variable based on the input parameter `self._fillstyle`. Once we have the correct manipulation of the `_filled` variable, we can call the `_marker_function` to ensure that the marker style is properly updated.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function, assuming that the logic for setting `_filled` is based on the input parameter `self._fillstyle`:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')  # Setting _filled based on _fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the logic for setting the `_filled` variable based on the `self._fillstyle` input parameter, we ensure that the marker style is correctly updated. This should resolve the bug.
