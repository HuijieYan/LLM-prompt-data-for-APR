The issue with the _recache function is that it directly calls self._marker_function without checking if it's callable. This can lead to errors, especially if the _marker_function is not defined or not a function.

To fix this bug, we need to check if self._marker_function is callable before calling it. Additionally, we should also initialize the _marker_function attribute to a default value if it's not already defined.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the _recache function now checks if self._marker_function is callable before calling it. If it's callable, the function proceeds with the re-caching behavior. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
