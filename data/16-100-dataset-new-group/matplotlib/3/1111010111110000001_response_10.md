The bug in the `_recache` function is that the method `marker_function()` is called without assigning its return value to any variable. Therefore, the method `marker_function()` is taking up the role of `is_filled` method. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct `is_filled` method is called and that the return value is properly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if isinstance(self._marker_function, bool):
            self._filled = self._marker_function
```

This corrected version checks if `self._marker_function` is a boolean value, and if true, assigns it to `_filled`. This should resolve the error and ensure that the correct method is called.
