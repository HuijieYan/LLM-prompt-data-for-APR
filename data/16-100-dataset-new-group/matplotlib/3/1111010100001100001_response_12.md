The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is setting `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, which may not be intended.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the value of `self._filled` is set based on the value of `self._fillstyle` rather than unconditionally. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set `self._filled` accordingly. If `self._fillstyle` has a value other than 'none', then `self._filled` is set to True. Otherwise, it's set to False. This ensures that `self._filled` is correctly determined based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.
