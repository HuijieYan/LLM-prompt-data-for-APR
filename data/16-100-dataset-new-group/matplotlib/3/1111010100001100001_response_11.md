The buggy function is supposed to recache the marker style, but it seems to be missing a check on the `_fillstyle` attribute, and it is not clear how the marker function is being set or called.

The `self._filled` attribute is being set incorrectly as `True` in Case 1 and `False` in Case 2. This indicates that the bug may be related to the `_filled` attribute not being properly set based on the input `self._fillstyle`.

To fix the bug, we should add a check for the `self._fillstyle` attribute and set the `_filled` attribute based on its value. Additionally, we should ensure that the `self._marker_function` is properly set and called.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```
