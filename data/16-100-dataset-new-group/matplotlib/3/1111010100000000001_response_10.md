## Correction

The buggy function `_recache` is missing the definition of `_marker_function`, which is called without being defined within the class. This results in an AttributeError because there is no function assigned to `self._marker_function`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
    def _marker_function(self):
        # define the marker function logic here
        pass
```

In the corrected version, the `_marker_function` is defined within the class MarkerStyle and can be called without resulting in an AttributeError.
