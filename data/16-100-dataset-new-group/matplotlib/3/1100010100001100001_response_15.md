The bug in the _recache function is that it is setting self._filled to True regardless of the value of self._fillstyle. This is causing the function to always return with self._filled set to True, which contradicts the input value of self._fillstyle in Case 1 and Case 2.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the _recache function to correctly set the value of self._filled based on the value of self._fillstyle.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional statement to set the value of self._filled based on the value of self._fillstyle. This will ensure that the function sets self._filled correctly according to the input value of self._fillstyle.
