## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is called when initializing the `MarkerStyle` class. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` because the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue could be in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, which goes against the expected behavior. This causes the markers not to be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly set the value of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the assignment to `_filled` to take into account the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the function should now correctly set `_filled` based on the value of `fillstyle`. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
