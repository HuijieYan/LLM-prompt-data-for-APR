The bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is that it is not initializing the `_marker_function` attribute correctly, which results in the marker not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

To fix this bug, the `_marker_function` attribute should be set to a function that sets the appropriate marker properties, such as defining the shape of the marker when it is filled or empty.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = self._marker_function()
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none' else True
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly set the marker properties based on the `fillstyle` and produce the expected results in the failing test case. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub, where the markers were not appearing as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` was set.
