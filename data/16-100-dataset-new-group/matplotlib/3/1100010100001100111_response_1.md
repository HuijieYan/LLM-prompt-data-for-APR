The bug in the function `_recache` is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This is causing the markers to always be filled even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, and the markers should appear hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This addresses the issue reported on GitHub where the markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to `'none'.
