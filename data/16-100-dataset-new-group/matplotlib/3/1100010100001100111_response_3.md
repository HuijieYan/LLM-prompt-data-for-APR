The bug in the function `_recache` is that it sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This results in the markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function so that it checks the value of `self._fillstyle` and sets `_filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the value of `self._fillstyle` and setting `_filled` accordingly, the corrected function ensures that the markers will be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none',` as expected by the user.
