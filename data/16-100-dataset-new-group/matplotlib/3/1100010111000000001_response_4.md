The potential error in the buggy function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists or not. This may lead to a `NoneType` object not callable error, and it is likely the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` exists before calling it. If it exists, then we can call it; otherwise, we should skip the call.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will now check if `self._marker_function` exists before attempting to call it, which should resolve the bug and allow the provided test function to pass.
