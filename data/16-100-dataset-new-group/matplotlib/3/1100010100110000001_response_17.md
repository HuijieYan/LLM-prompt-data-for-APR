The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result. This suggests that there is an issue with how the `_filled` attribute is being handled in the `_recache` function.

Upon reviewing the `_recache` function, it is clear that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which may not be the desired behavior. This is likely causing the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_recache` function to properly handle the `_filled` attribute based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `_fillstyle`, we ensure that it reflects the intended filled status of the marker.

After applying this fix, the `is_filled` method should return the correct result, and the failing test should pass.
