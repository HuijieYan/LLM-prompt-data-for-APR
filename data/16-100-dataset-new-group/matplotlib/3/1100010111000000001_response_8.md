The buggy function is a method named _recache, which sets a number of properties to default values before calling a marker function. The issue seems to be with the _marker_function call, which is being called without checking if it exists.

The potential error location is the line `self._marker_function()` because it is called without checking if self._marker_function is defined or not. This can cause an AttributeError if _marker_function is not defined.

The cause of the bug is that when _marker_function is called without checking if it exists, it can raise an AttributeError if it is not defined. In this case, it is not defined, causing the test to fail.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to check if self._marker_function is not None before calling it. This can be done by adding a condition to check if self._marker_function is not None before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the _recache function will only call self._marker_function if it is not None, preventing the AttributeError and allowing the test to pass.
