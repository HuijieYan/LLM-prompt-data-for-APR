## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = Path(array([[0.0, -1.0], ... [1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 79]], dtype=uint8))
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set filled to False to make the marker hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function was causing the markers to not appear hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter was set to 'none'. The `self._filled` variable was being set to `True`, which was incorrect for creating a hollow marker. By setting `self._filled` to `False`, the marker will appear hollow.

The corrected version of the function updates the `self._filled` variable to `False` to make the marker hollow. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the markers will appear as expected when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'.
