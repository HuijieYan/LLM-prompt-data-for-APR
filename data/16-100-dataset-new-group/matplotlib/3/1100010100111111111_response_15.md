## The bug in the original function:

The bug in the original function is that it always sets `self._filled` to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the `is_filled()` method to always return `True`, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` method to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the `is_filled()` method will return the correct value.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It will also resolve the issue reported in GitHub with markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
