### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is evident from the failing test case where the marker style is set to have `fillstyle='none'` but the `is_filled` method returns `True`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` in the `_recache` function, but it is not correctly connected to the `is_filled` method, resulting in the incorrect return value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly linked to the `is_filled` method. This can be achieved by updating the logic within the `_recache` function to accurately set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `_filled` attribute.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that it reflects the correct filled status of the marker. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the expected result.
