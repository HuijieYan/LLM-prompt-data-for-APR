The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not setting the `self._marker_function` correctly, which is causing the function to fail. The function should set the `self._marker_function` before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we make sure to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. We also set the `self._snap_threshold` to `float('inf')` to represent infinity.
