The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not setting the `self._path` attribute to the correct value. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True`, when it should not be.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self._path` with the correct value that represents an empty path, and this will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    from .path import Path
    import numpy as np
    
    self._path = Path(np.array([]))
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = np.inf
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By initializing `self._path` with an empty path, we ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value, fixing the bug. This version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
