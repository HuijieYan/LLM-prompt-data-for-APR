## Analysis:
The buggy function _recache() is part of the MarkerStyle class and is intended to recache the marker based on certain conditions. However, the bug lies in the invocation of the _marker_function which is not defined within the class. This leads to a NameError when the function is called.

## Identified Error Location:
The error lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where _marker_function is not defined within the class.

## Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function is attempting to call a function that has not been defined within the class, which results in a NameError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the _marker_function within the class and ensure it exists or,
2. Change the logic to ensure that the function being called actually exists and serves the intended purpose.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
