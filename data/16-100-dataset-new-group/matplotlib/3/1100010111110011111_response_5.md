## The cause of the bug
The `_recache` function is designed to update the marker attributes. However, there is a bug in the function that prevents it from updating the `self._filled` attribute properly. This results in the `MarkerStyle` object incorrectly reporting that the marker is filled when it should be hollow. This bug is reflected in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` where the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` fails when it should pass, indicating that the marker is not filled.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, the `_recache` function needs to properly update the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. Additionally, the function should examine and apply the correct logic for creating a hollow marker based on the specified `fillstyle`. This can be done by modifying the conditional checks in the `_recache` function to appropriately set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ('none', 'hollow'):
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_recache` function to properly set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version will address the bug and ensure that the `MarkerStyle` object accurately reflects the specified fillstyle.
