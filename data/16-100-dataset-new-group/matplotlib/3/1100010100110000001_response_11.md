The bug in the given function is that it is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute. This causes the `is_filled` method to return an incorrect value, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be set based on the fillstyle provided. If the fillstyle is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to False.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute will now be set based on the fillstyle, and the failing test is expected to pass.
