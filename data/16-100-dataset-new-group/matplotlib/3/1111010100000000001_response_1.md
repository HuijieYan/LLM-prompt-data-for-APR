The buggy function `_marker_function()` is being called without being checked for existence. This can result in an AttributeError if `_marker_function` does not exist. To fix this, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():


    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function exists
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
