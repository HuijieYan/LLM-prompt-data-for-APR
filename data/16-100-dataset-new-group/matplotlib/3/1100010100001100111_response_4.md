The buggy function is setting the `_filled` variable to `True` regardless of the input value of `self._fillstyle`. This is causing the markers to be filled when the intention is to have them hollow.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the input value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the markers should behave as expected, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
