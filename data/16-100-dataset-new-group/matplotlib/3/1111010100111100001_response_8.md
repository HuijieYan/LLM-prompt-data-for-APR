The bug in the provided function is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` regardless of the fillstyle specified. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, resulting in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the specified fillstyle. If the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
