The issue with the current implementation is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` regardless of the value of the `self._fillstyle` parameter. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should not, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle` by using a conditional expression. This will ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the actual fill style of the marker, and the failing test should pass with this fix.
