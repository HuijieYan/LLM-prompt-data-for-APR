The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `if self._marker_function is None` may not be appropriate for checking if the marker function exists. It should be `if not callable(self._marker_function):` instead.
2. The line `self._path = _empty_path` suggests that `_empty_path` might not be defined or imported properly.

The cause of the bug is likely that the condition `if self._marker_function is None` does not accurately check for the existence of the marker function. Additionally, the `_empty_path` might not be defined or imported properly, which could result in unexpected behavior when assigning it to `self._path`.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to:
1. Change the condition to `if not callable(self._marker_function):` to accurately check if the marker function exists.
2. Ensure that the `_empty_path` is properly defined and imported.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if not callable(self._marker_function):
            return
        from .transforms import _empty_path, IdentityTransform # Assuming _empty_path is imported here
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should effectively detect the marker function and assign the `_empty_path` properly, which should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
