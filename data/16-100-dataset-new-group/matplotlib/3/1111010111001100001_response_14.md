The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the actual fillstyle. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the fillstyle when setting the `_filled` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, we ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the fillstyle specified.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass.
