The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly setting the fillstyle to 'none' when the marker is initialized with the fillstyle parameter. This results in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` is being called before updating the fillstyle, which causes the fillstyle to remain as 'filled' instead of being set to 'none' when the marker is initialized with the fillstyle parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the fillstyle is updated before calling the `_marker_function`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will now update the filled property based on the fillstyle before calling the `_marker_function`, ensuring that the fillstyle is correctly set based on the input parameters. This should make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` pass.
