Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the `fillstyle` parameter not working as expected when using a custom MarkerStyle. The issue is that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

Potential error locations within the function:
The issue may be in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True`, which overrides the `fillstyle='none'` setting.

Cause of the bug using the buggy function and the GitHub Issue information:
The `_recache` function initializes the marker attributes, including the `_filled` attribute, which is always set to `True`. This overrides the `fillstyle='none'` setting, resulting in filled markers instead of hollow ones.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and ensure that setting it to 'none' results in hollow markers.

Corrected version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set _filled to False to allow for hollow markers
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, I've updated the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute to `False`, which will allow for hollow markers when using the `fillstyle='none'` setting.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that setting `fillstyle='none'` results in hollow markers when using a custom MarkerStyle.
