## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to recalculate the marker style attributes. However, it currently has a conditional that checks if the `_marker_function` is None, which doesn't seem correct.

## Identified potential error
The potential error lies in the conditional check `if self._marker_function is None:`. It should instead check if it exists or callable.

## Cause of the bug
The bug causes the `_marker_function()` to be called regardless of its existence or value. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check if `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it.
2. If it is callable, then call it. If not, skip calling it.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
