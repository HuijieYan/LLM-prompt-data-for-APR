The buggy function is a method called _recache that is part of the markers.py file from the matplotlib library. This function is designed to recache marker properties.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The function is trying to call self._marker_function without checking if it exists or if it is callable.
2. There is no error handling or checks for the _marker_function.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not verify if self._marker_function exists or if it is callable before attempting to call it. This can lead to a potential AttributeError if the _marker_function does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that self._marker_function exists and is callable before attempting to call it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # handle the case when _marker_function is not callable
        # this can be an error, a warning, or some default behavior
        pass
```

In the corrected version, we added a check using the callable() function to ensure that self._marker_function is callable before attempting to call it. If it is not callable, you can add error handling, a warning, or some default behavior to handle this case.
