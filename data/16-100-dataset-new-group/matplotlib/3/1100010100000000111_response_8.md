## Analysis
The issue on GitHub describes a situation where the markers are not hollow when a custom markers.MarkerStyle with fillstyle='none' is used. The code provided in the issue is related to the `scatter` function in Matplotlib, and it seems that the markers are not behaving as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
The `_recache` function in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` sets the fillstyle and other properties of the marker. Since the issue is related to the markers not being hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none', the bug is likely in the `_recache` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling or application of the fillstyle parameter in the `_recache` function. When the fillstyle is set to 'none', it should result in hollow markers, but that is not happening, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` function correctly handles the fillstyle parameter, and that when fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers are indeed rendered as hollow.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Ensure that markers are not filled
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` instead of `True`, which ensures that the markers will not be filled when the custom markers.MarkerStyle with fillstyle='none' is used. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and render the markers as hollow as expected.
