## The fixed version of the function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = None
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
- The bug in the original function was that it was setting the `_path` variable to `_empty_path`, which does not match the expected value and type specified in the failing test case.
- The `_snap_threshold` was being set to `None`, but the expected value was `inf`, which is a float.
- The other variables did not have bugs, but I have added the correct type for `_snap_threshold`.

The fixed version sets `_path` to `None`, which is a placeholder for the expected `Path` type. It also sets `_snap_threshold` to the correct float value `inf`.

This fixed version of the function should pass the failing test case.
