The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the marker to not be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. The function is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle`. This is causing the marker to always be filled, regardless of the `fillstyle` setting.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` setting. If the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`. If the `fillstyle` is set to anything else, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the `fillstyle` setting, and the marker will correctly display as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

This change will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `test_marker_fillstyle` pass.
