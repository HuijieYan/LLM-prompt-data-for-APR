The issue is related to the `MarkerStyle` class's `_recache` function, where the fillstyle is not being handled properly, resulting in markers not being rendered as hollow even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in `test_marker.py` indicates that the `is_filled` method returns `True` when it should return `False`.

The cause of the bug is that the `MarkerStyle` class's `_recache` function is not checking the `fillstyle` attribute, causing the `filled` attribute to always be set to `True` regardless of the value of `fillstyle`. This leads to the `is_filled` method returning `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to handle the `fillstyle` attribute and set the `filled` attribute accordingly. The corrected version of the function should check the `fillstyle` and adjust the `filled` attribute based on its value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This modification ensures that the `filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` attribute, allowing correct handling of marker fill styles.

By making this change, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should now pass, and it should also address the issue reported on GitHub regarding markers not being rendered as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to `'none'`.
