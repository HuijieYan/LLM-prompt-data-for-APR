## Analysis
The buggy function is "_recache" from the MarkerStyle class. This function is responsible for setting various properties of the marker style such as path, transform, snap_threshold, joinstyle, capstyle, and filled, but it appears to be incomplete or incorrect. The failing test "test_marker_fillstyle" checks if the function "is_filled" returns the correct value when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The error message shows that "is_filled" is returning True instead of False when the fillstyle is 'none'.

## Error Location
The _recache function does not properly handle the case when the fillstyle is set to 'none', leading to incorrect values for the filled property.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the _recache function does not appropriately update the filled property based on the fillstyle setting, leading to the incorrect return value for is_filled. This is causing an assertion error in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the _recache function should be modified to properly handle the case when the fillstyle is 'none' and ensure that the filled property reflects this setting accurately.

## Bug-fixed version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
