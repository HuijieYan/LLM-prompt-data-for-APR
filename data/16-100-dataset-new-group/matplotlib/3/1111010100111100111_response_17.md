### Explain the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `is_filled()` method returning the opposite boolean value of what is expected. This is due to the default value of `self._filled` being set to `False`, which contradicts the expected behavior of the `fillstyle` parameter when set to `'none'`.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `is_filled()` method should return the correct boolean value based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then the marker should not be filled, hence `is_filled()` should return `False`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the function will return the correct boolean value when the `is_filled()` method is called.

Once this correction is made, the failing test for `marker_style.is_filled()` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
