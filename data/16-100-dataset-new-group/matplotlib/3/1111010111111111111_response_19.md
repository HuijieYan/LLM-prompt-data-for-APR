## Bug Explanation
The bug is in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. The function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which causes the failing test. The failing test checks the value of `marker_style.is_filled()` and expects it to return `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. However, due to the unconditional assignment within the `_recache` function, the `is_filled` method always returns `True`, causing the test to fail.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function so that it takes into account the `fillstyle` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to reflect the expectation of non-filled markers.

## Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to check the `fillstyle` and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly, we ensure that the expected behavior for `is_filled` is maintained, resolving the bug.
