The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `False` when it should return `True` according to the failing test and the expected input/output values. 

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` if the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`, we ensure that the `is_filled` method will return the correct value according to the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well, where the markers were not hollow when `fillstyle` was set to 'none'. Now, the markers should display as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.
