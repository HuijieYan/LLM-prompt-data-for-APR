### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is meant to recalculate the marker style properties, but there is a logic issue within the function that prevents it from updating the `fillstyle` property correctly. This is indicated by the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` and the provided runtime input/output values.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` specifically tests the `MarkerStyle` class with `fillstyle='none'` and expects the marker to be hollow, but it fails to do so. This corresponds to the GitHub issue where the user is also trying to create a hollow marker using `fillstyle='none'` but is not getting the expected result when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the `_recache` function handles the `_filled` property. Since the `_filled` property is set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter, this prevents the marker from being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should update the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to create a hollow marker.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that the marker is correctly rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified. This change addresses the issue reported on GitHub and passes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
