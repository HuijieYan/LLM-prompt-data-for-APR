The bug in the _recache function is that it is checking if self._marker_function is None and returning if it is, without actually doing anything. This means that the function will not execute if self._marker_function is None, leading to potential issues with the markers.

To fix this bug, we should remove the check for self._marker_function and directly execute it without any conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._marker_function()
```

This fixed version ensures that the _marker_function is executed regardless of its value.
