The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to set the `_filled` attribute to `False` as expected when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This results in the `is_filled` method returning `True` instead of `False` when it is called.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` within the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
By modifying the assignment of the `_filled` attribute to `self._fillstyle != 'none'`, we can ensure that it is set to `True` or `False` based on the value of `fillstyle`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
