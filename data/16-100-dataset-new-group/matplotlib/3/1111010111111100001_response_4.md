The issue with the current implementation is that the `is_filled` method is not correctly returning the filled property of the marker. This is likely because the `_filled` property is being incorrectly set to `False` in the `_recache` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` property is set correctly based on the fill style provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. We can do this by updating the `_recache` method to correctly reflect the fill style.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

This correction ensures that the `_filled` property reflects the fill style provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. With this correction, the failing test should now pass.
