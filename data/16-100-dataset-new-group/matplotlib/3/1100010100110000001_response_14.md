The buggy function `_recache` is failing to properly set the filled attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object, resulting in the `is_filled` method returning `True` when it should not be. This is causing the test to fail with an assertion error.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should correctly set the filled attribute based on the fillstyle provided in the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'full':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected function checks the fillstyle of the `MarkerStyle` object and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly before calling the marker function. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value.
