## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with test code

The buggy function is `_recache`, which seems to be a method of a class given its use of `self`. The function checks if `_marker_function` is `None` and exits early if so. Otherwise, it sets several attributes to default values and then calls `_marker_function`. 

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with marker='o' and fillstyle='none', then asserts that the fillstyle is 'none' and that the marker is not filled.


## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error in the `_recache` function is the use of `self._marker_function()` without first checking if it exists. If this function is not defined, it will cause an exception when called.


## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test

The bug occurs because the `_recache` function does not handle the case where `_marker_function` is not defined. This causes the failing test to result in an exception when it tries to create the `MarkerStyle` object.


## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. If it is `None`, then we should handle this case appropriately.


## A corrected version of the function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added the condition `if callable(self._marker_function):` to check if `_marker_function` is callable before calling it. This will prevent the exception from occurring when `_marker_function` is not defined.
