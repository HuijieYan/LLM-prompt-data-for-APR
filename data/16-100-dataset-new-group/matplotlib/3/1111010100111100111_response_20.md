The cause of the bug is that the is_filled() method is returning the opposite of the intended value. The is_filled() method should return True when the marker is filled and False when it is not filled. However, currently, it is returning the opposite value, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the is_filled() method needs to be modified to return the correct value and ensure that the MarkerStyle class functions correctly with the fillstyle parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False  # Set filled to False for 'none' fillstyle
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the is_filled() method will correctly return True for filled markers and False for unfilled markers based on the specified fillstyle. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the failing test for marker_style.is_filled() passes.
