The buggy function `_recache` is trying to update certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class, such as `_path`, `_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`, and then calling the `_marker_function`. However, based on the error message and the failing test, it seems that the `is_filled` method is returning the opposite of the expected value.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True`, but the `is_filled` method is returning `False`, causing the assertion to fail.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` if the marker is 'none', and `True` otherwise.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._marker != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on the marker type
    self._marker_function()
```
