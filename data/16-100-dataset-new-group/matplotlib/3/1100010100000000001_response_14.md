## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Fixed the condition to check if marker_function is not None
        self._path = None  # Reset the path to None
        self._transform = Affine2D()  # Reset the transform to an instance of Affine2D
        self._alt_path = None  # Reset the alt_path to None
        self._alt_transform = None  # Reset the alt_transform to None
        self._snap_threshold = 1.0  # Set a default value for snap_threshold
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        return
```

### Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to reset some attributes and then call the `_marker_function`. However, the current condition `if self._marker_function is None:` is checking if `_marker_function` is None, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

### Error Locations:
1. The condition `if self._marker_function is None:` is incorrect.
2. The snap_threshold is not being set to a default value.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition which prevents the intended behavior of the function, and the snap_threshold is not being set to a default value.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Change the condition to `if self._marker_function is not None:` to execute the code when `_marker_function` is not None.
- Add a default value for `snap_threshold` to ensure it is always set.

### Fixed Version:
- The fixed version of the function includes a corrected condition and sets a default value for `snap_threshold`.
