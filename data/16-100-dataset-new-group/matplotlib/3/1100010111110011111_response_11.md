To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. Currently, the function does not consider the `fillstyle` when setting up the marker, which leads to the failing test. 

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function does not account for the `fillstyle` parameter. As a result, when a custom MarkerStyle with `fillstyle` set to 'none' is used, it does not correctly handle the filling of markers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to account for the `fillstyle` parameter and appropriately handle the filling of markers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle not in ('none', 'nothing')
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version of the function, we added the line `self._filled = self._fillstyle not in ('none', 'nothing')` to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value.

By making this change, the MarkerStyle will correctly handle the filling of markers based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test should pass. This fix also addresses the issue posted on GitHub where markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to 'none'.
