Based on the error message from the failing test and the provided information, it appears that the `is_filled()` method is not functioning as expected, causing the failing test. The `is_filled()` method should return whether the markers are filled or not, based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `is_filled()` method to check the `fillstyle` parameter and return `True` if the `fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`, indicating that the markers are filled.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache() function in the MarkerStyle class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Check fillstyle to determine if markers are filled
        self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_recache()` function to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the markers are correctly labeled as filled or not. This should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
