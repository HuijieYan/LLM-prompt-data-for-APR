The bug in the _recache function is that it sets the self._filled attribute to True regardless of the fillstyle value, which causes the is_filled method to return True for all MarkerStyle objects. This contradicts the expected behavior, as setting fillstyle='none' should result in a hollow marker.

To fix this bug, we need to update the _recache function to consider the fillstyle value when setting the self._filled attribute. If fillstyle is 'none', then self._filled should be set to False.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _recache function to consider the fillstyle value, we ensure that the self._filled attribute reflects the intended behavior based on the fillstyle, which resolves the issue reported on GitHub and passes the failing test.
