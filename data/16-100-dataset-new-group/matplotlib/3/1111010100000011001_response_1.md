The bug in the current function is that the `_marker_function` is being called without any arguments or return values. As a result, the function is not actually doing anything and the expected values for the variables are not being updated.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to actually call the `_marker_function` with the appropriate arguments and update the relevant variables based on the return values of the `_marker_function`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._path, self._snap_threshold, self._joinstyle, self._capstyle, self._filled = self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_marker_function` is called with appropriate arguments, and the return values are assigned to the relevant variables, updating them as expected.
