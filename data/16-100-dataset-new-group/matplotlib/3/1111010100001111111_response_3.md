The issue here is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` unconditionally in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which conflicts with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, which will resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
