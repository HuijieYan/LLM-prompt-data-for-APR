The buggy function is `_recache`, and it appears to be related to the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`. The error message indicates that the test failed at the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`, with the specific error message showing that the function `is_filled` did not return `False` as expected.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object. The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file does not handle the `fillstyle` attribute properly, which is causing the `is_filled` function to return an unexpected value.

To fix the bug, the `MarkerStyle` object needs to be modified to properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and update its internal state accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function now properly updates the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, which should resolve the issue with the failing test.
