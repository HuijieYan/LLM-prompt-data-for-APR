The buggy function seems to be intended to reinitialize several class attributes to their default values and then call a marker function if it is defined. 

The issue with the current implementation is that it always calls the marker function, regardless of whether it is defined or not.

To fix the bug, we should only call the marker function if it is defined.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we added a condition to check if the marker function is not None before calling it. This will prevent calling the marker function when it is not defined, and should fix the bug.
