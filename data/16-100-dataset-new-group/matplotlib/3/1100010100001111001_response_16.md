The bug in the _recache function is that it sets self._filled to True regardless of the input value of self._fillstyle. We can fix this by checking the value of self._fillstyle and setting self._filled accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly set self._filled based on the value of self._fillstyle, as expected.
