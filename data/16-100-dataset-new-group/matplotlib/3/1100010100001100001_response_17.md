The issue in the provided buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the case when `self._marker_function` is None. This leads to the function not returning as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is None and return without executing it if so.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle the case when `self._marker_function` is None and return without attempting to execute it.
