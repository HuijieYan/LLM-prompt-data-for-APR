To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class. It seems that the bug is caused by the `is_filled` method returning the wrong value. Based on the provided error message and runtime values, it is expected that the `_filled` attribute should be set to True when `self._fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we added a conditional statement to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` is set to False. Otherwise, it is set to True.

With this change, the failing test should pass, and the `MarkerStyle` should now behave as expected when setting `fillstyle='none'` in the provided code example. This fix also resolves the issue posted on GitHub, where the markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none'.
