To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value. We can do this by checking if the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' and then setting `_filled` to False. Otherwise, we'll set it to True.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# this is the corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `self._filled` attribute will be set to True or False based on the `fillstyle` value, and the failing test will pass. This will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub, as the markers will now appear hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.
