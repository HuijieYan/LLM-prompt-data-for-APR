## Analysis
The error message indicates that the function `is_filled` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not returning the expected value. This suggests that the `_recache` function, which sets the filled attribute, may be the cause of the bug.

## Potential Error Locations
The `_recache` function is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which may be causing the `is_filled` function to return the wrong value.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function unconditionally setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` without taking into account the user-specified `fillstyle`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `_filled` attribute should be set according to the user-specified `fillstyle`. If the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled according to _fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check for the `fillstyle` before setting the `_filled` attribute, the corrected version ensures that the `_filled` attribute takes into account the user-specified `fillstyle`. This should resolve the bug and make the `is_filled` function return the correct value.
