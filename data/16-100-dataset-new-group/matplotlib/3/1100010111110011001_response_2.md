To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to ensure that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class returns the correct value based on the `_filled` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Set snap_threshold to infinity
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set filled to False
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original `_recache` function is that it always sets the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which causes the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class to return `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` used.

To fix the bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute to `False` in the `_recache` function to reflect the correct `fillstyle` used.

With this correction, the `_recache` function will reset all necessary attributes and the `is_filled` method will return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` specified.

After making this correction, the provided failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass without any assertion errors.
