## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache()` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for setting several attributes, but it's not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter, which is causing markers to not appear as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue lies in the `_recache()` function where it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` by default, and there is no condition that checks for the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache()` function not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter. When the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers should appear hollow, but due to the absence of proper conditional checks, the markers are not appearing as hollow.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache()` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. We should check if the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' and accordingly update the `_filled` attribute to `False` so that the markers appear hollow.

## Corrected Version

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional check for the `fillstyle` parameter and updated the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then `_filled` is set to `False` to make the markers appear hollow. This modification should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
