The issue with the buggy function is that it always sets `self._filled` to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to set `self._filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated line
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the function will correctly set `self._filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the markers will be filled or hollow as expected.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not hollow when `ax.scatter()` was used with `fillstyle='none'`.
