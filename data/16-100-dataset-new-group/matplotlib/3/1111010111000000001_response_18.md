## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to recalculate the marker style attributes, but it is not doing so correctly. The function is setting the `_path` and `_transform` attributes to fixed values and then calling an unknown `_marker_function()`. This could be causing the function to fail.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The `_marker_function` could be causing the failure if it's not defined properly.
2. The setting of `_path` and `_transform` to fixed values may not be correct.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `_marker_function` and the fixed setting of `_path` and `_transform`. This is evident from the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` and the behavior of the `_recache` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Determine the correct behavior of the `_marker_function` and ensure it is properly defined.
2. Ensure that the `_path` and `_transform` attributes are recalculated correctly based on the marker style.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = self._marker_function()
            self._transform = Affine2D().rotate(0)
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
```
