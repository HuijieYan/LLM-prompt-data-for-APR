## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._set_no_fill()
    self._marker_function()

def _set_no_fill(self):
    self._fillstyle = 'none'
    self._filled = False
```

Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function does not properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter when setting markers. This results in the markers not appearing as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix the bug, we have updated the `_recache` function to call a new method `_set_no_fill` which will properly handle the `fillstyle` and set the markers to be hollow. It includes setting the `_fillstyle` attribute to 'none' and updating the `_filled` attribute to False.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as it addresses the problem of markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function will now properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and the markers will appear as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
