The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking whether the function is defined. This will result in an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is None.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is defined before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it is not None, avoiding the AttributeError and passing the failing test case.
