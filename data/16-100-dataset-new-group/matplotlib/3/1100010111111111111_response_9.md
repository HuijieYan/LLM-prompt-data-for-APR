The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to the incorrect behavior when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that the markers are filled or hollow as expected.

This fix should address the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
