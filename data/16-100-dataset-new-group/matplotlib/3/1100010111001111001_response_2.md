To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to update the `_filled` variable to `True` before calling the `_marker_function()`. This will ensure that the marker is filled correctly when the function is called.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
