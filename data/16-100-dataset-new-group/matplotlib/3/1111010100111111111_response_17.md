The issue with the buggy function `_recache` is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the `self._fillstyle` value. This causes the `is_filled()` method to always return `True`, even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `self._fillstyle` value and set `_filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, resolving the issue with the `is_filled()` method not returning the correct value.

This correction will also address the GitHub issue where markers were not appearing as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none'.
