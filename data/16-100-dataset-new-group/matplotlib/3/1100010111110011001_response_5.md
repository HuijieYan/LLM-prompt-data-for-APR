The bug in the function `_recache` is that it is not setting the `self._marker_function` attribute correctly, which is causing the failing test for the `is_filled()` method.

In order to fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is set to a method that updates the marker properties including the `is_filled` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should now pass and the expected input/output values will be satisfied.
