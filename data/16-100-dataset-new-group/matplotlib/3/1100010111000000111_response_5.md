## Analysis
The `_recache` function is called to reset marker properties and is expected to set the marker to be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. However, the `filled` property is always being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle`, which is causing the markers to always be filled.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_filled` property always being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` setting. This prevents the markers from being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` setting. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then the `_filled` property should be set to `False` to render the markers hollow.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled property based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` property will now be updated based on the `fillstyle` setting, allowing the markers to be rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the markers are rendered as expected.
