## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting the marker style attributes before rendering the marker. The problem seems to be related to the `fillstyle` attribute not working as expected when setting markers to hollow.

## Potential error locations:
The issue may arise from the way the `filled` attribute is being set to `True`, which could be overriding the `fillstyle='none'` parameter. It's also possible that the `_marker_function` is not handling the `fillstyle` parameter correctly.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the `filled` attribute being set to `True` by default, overriding the `fillstyle='none'` parameter. This likely results in all markers being rendered as filled, instead of hollow as expected.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter by setting the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. Additionally, the `_marker_function` should be updated to consider the `fillstyle` attribute when rendering the markers.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Check the fillstyle attribute
        self._marker_function()
    
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return getattr(self, 'fillstyle', 'full')  # Get the fillstyle attribute or default to 'full'
```

In this corrected version, the `_recache` function now utilizes a method `get_fillstyle` to obtain the `fillstyle` attribute and use it to set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This change ensures that the `fillstyle` parameter will be correctly reflected in the marker rendering process.
