## The buggy function and its relationship with other code
The buggy function is the `_recache` method within the `MarkerStyle` class in the `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` file. This method is called when certain properties of the MarkerStyle object need to be recalculated. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is located in the `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_marker.py` file and it checks if the `is_filled` method of the MarkerStyle object returns the correct value after setting the fillstyle to 'none'. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the `_recache` method are centered around the initialization of properties like `_path`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`. It seems that these properties are not being correctly updated when the `_recache` method is called, causing the erroneous behavior in the `is_filled` method.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` method not correctly updating the properties of the MarkerStyle object. This results in the `is_filled` method returning the wrong value.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` method should be modified to properly update all the relevant properties of the MarkerStyle object when it is called. Specifically, the `_filled` property should be updated according to the fillstyle parameter.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf') # Update snap threshold
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none' # Update filled property based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` property is updated based on the `_fillstyle` parameter, and the `snap_threshold` is set to `float('inf')` to match the expected behavior.
