The buggy function `_recache` is not properly setting the fillstyle to 'none' as per the GitHub issue. This leads to the markers not appearing as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting the fillstyle to 'none'. The problem lies in the `_recache` function not considering the fillstyle parameter when re-caching the marker.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_recache` function to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that it is set to 'none' when the marker style is being re-cached.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False # setting the filled attribute to False
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute to `False`, we ensure that the markers will appear as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This fix addresses the GitHub issue where the markers were not appearing as hollow when setting the fillstyle to 'none' using `ax.scatter()`.
