The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to set the marker as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return True when it should return False according to the failing test.

The bug is likely located within the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is being set. The function is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` specified, leading to an incorrect return value for `is_filled`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the case where `fillstyle` is set to 'none', and set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set correctly based on the `fillstyle` value, ensuring that the `is_filled` method returns the expected value. This fix will resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
