## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Correcting the value to make the marker hollow
        self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `self._filled` attribute to `False` instead of `True`, the marker will be rendered as hollow, as expected. This change in the `_recache` function will address the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
