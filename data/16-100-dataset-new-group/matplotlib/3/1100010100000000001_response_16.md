The buggy function is a method called `_recache` within the `markers.py` file. This method is intended to reset and recache certain attributes, but it appears to have a bug.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `if self._marker_function is None:` may not be checking the correct attribute or the condition itself may be incorrect.
2. The line `self._marker_function()` may be attempting to call a non-existent function or method.

The cause of the bug is likely that the `_marker_function` attribute is not being properly assigned or defined, leading to the condition always being True and the subsequent attempt to call a non-existent function causing an error.

To fix the bug, we need to properly assign a function to the `_marker_function` attribute and update the condition to check for its presence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        return
```

In this corrected version:
- We use the `callable` function to check if `_marker_function` is a callable object (i.e., a function or method).
- If it is callable, we proceed with the reset and recaching of attributes.
- If it is not callable, we simply return from the function without performing any further actions.
