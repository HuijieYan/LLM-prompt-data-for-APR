### Analysis:
The `_recache` function sets various attributes to default values, but the bug seems to be related to the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` not returning the correct value.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be returning `False` as specified by the `fillstyle='none'` parameter in the test code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to ensure that the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided. This may involve modifying the logic within the `is_filled` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we add a condition to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `_fillstyle`. If `_fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. If `_fillstyle` has any other value, `_filled` is set to `True`. This change should ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

After making this change, the `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
