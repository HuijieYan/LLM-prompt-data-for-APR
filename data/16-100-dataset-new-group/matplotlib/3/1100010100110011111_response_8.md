## Correction of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = None  # Changing to None as this will be assigned in the marker function
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Changing to float('inf') to represent infinity
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Changing to False as we want the markers to be hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The buggy function was setting `self._filled` to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter being set to 'none'. This caused the markers to always be filled, even when the intention was to have hollow markers. To fix this, the corrected version sets `self._filled` to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow.

Additionally, the `_path` and `_snap_threshold` are set to `None` and `inf` respectively, as they will be assigned appropriate values in the marker function.

By making these changes, we address the issue reported on GitHub where setting `fillstyle='none'` did not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`. The corrected function now ensures that the markers will be hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'.
