The buggy function `_recache` is designed to reset the attributes of the object to their default values. However, the bug lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where it tries to call a method without checking if it exists, which can potentially lead to an AttributeError.

The cause of the bug is that the code doesn't check if `_marker_function` attribute exists or not before calling it. This can potentially lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` does not exist for the object.

To fix the bug, we should check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it to avoid potential AttributeError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self._marker_function is not None:` before calling the `_marker_function()` to ensure that it exists before calling it. This will prevent any potential AttributeError from occurring.
