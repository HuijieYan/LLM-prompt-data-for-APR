The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the test to fail. This is because the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` by default, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This is contrary to the expected behavior, where setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in a non-filled marker.

To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, such that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` is also set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # The corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function now correctly sets the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, and the failing test should now pass. This should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub about markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
