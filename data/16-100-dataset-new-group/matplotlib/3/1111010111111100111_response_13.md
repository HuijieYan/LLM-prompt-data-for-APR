To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to correct the condition that sets the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated condition
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the `_filled` attribute assignment to check if the `fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`. This fixes the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, which caused the markers to not be hollow when `fillstyle` was set to `'none'. Now, the `fillstyle` will correctly affect the appearance of the markers.
