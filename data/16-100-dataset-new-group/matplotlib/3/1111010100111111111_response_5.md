### Bug Fix Strategy
The issue seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute not being set to `False` despite setting the `fillstyle` as 'none'. This is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False`, leading to the assertion error.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` set by the user. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the `fillstyle` set by the user. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `is_filled()` method return the correct value.
