##  Analysis
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting the fillstyle parameter to 'none' when using markers.MarkerStyle on scatter plot does not result in hollow markers as expected.

##  Identified Bug
The bug is likely in the _recache function where the _filled attribute is being set to True unconditionally. This is inconsistent with the behavior expected when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

## Bug Explanation
The _recache function sets the initial properties for the marker, including whether it is filled or not. However, when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the marker should not be filled. The current implementation always sets _filled to True, regardless of the fillstyle setting.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the _filled attribute should be updated based on the fillstyle parameter. If the fillstyle is set to 'none', then _filled should be set to False, indicating that the marker should not be filled.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() in ('full', 'left', 'right'):
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False

    self._marker_function()
```
