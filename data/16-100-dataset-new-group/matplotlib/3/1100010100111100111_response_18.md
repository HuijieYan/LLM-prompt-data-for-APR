The issue is that when `markers.MarkerStyle` is instantiated with `fillstyle='none'`, the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is causing the failing test case and the issue reported on GitHub.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` by default, which is incorrect when `fillstyle='none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ('none', 'none') or (isinstance(self._fillstyle, list) and 'none' in self._fillstyle):
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` or `('none', 'none')` in a list (as per the documentation), we can properly set the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the marker should be hollow. This will fix the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
