## The analysis
The buggy function `_recache` sets the attribute `self._filled` to `True` regardless of the value of `fillstyle` when `marker_style` is initialized. This results in the issue reported on GitHub where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not produce a hollow marker as expected.

## Identifying potential error locations
The potential error in the function is the line `self._filled = True`, which is not conditional based on the value of `fillstyle`.

## Explanation of the bug's cause
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the value of `fillstyle`. This causes markers to always be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

## The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `True`, otherwise it is set to `False`. This change will ensure that markers are filled only when `fillstyle` is not `'none'`.
