### Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, corresponding error message, the GitHub issue.

1. The buggy function is `_recache` which is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which is unexpected.
3. The GitHub issue describes a problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.

The potential error locations within the `_recache` function are:
- The initialization of `self._filled` to `True`.
- A call to `self._marker_function()` without checking if it has been defined.

### Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is always being set to `True` in the `_recache` method, regardless of the `fillstyle` setting. Additionally, the `self._marker_function()` is being called without checking if it exists, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.

The bug can be fixed by:
1. Checking the `fillstyle` in the `_recache` method and setting `_filled` accordingly.
2. Checking if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Check fillstyle and set _filled accordingly
        if hasattr(self, '_marker_function') and callable(self._marker_function):  # Check if _marker_function is defined and callable
            self._marker_function()
```
In this corrected version:
- The `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `_fillstyle`.
- Before calling `self._marker_function()`, it is checked if it is defined and callable.
