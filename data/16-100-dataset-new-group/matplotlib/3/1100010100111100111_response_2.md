## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = None  # Resetting the path to None
    self._transform = Affine2D()  # Using the correct transform
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = 0.0  # Setting a default value for snap_threshold
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Setting filled to False for hollow markers
    self._marker_function()
```

The issue with the original function is that it was not correctly handling the 'fillstyle' parameter, which was causing the markers to not appear as hollow when using ax.scatter(). By setting the '_filled' attribute to False, we can ensure that the markers will be hollow when the 'fillstyle' is set to 'none'.

By correcting the function to use the correct transform and setting appropriate default values, we can address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

This corrected version should now address the problem reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the markers appear hollow when using the specified 'fillstyle'.
