The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, so even if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will still be filled.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to check if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` and then set the `_filled` attribute to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled to False if fillstyle is 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function in this way, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `True` only if `fillstyle` is not equal to 'none', which will resolve the issue and make the markers hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

This fix should address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub where the markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with `markers.MarkerStyle()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.
