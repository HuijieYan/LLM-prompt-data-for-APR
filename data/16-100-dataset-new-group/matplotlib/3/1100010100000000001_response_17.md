## Analysis
The function `_recache` is meant to reset certain attributes and then call the `_marker_function`. However, the bug seems to be that the `_marker_function` is being called without checking if it exists or not, which could lead to an AttributeError.

## Identify potential error locations
The potential error is at the line `self._marker_function()` where `_marker_function` is called without checking if it is None or not.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is None, which may raise an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

## Corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
