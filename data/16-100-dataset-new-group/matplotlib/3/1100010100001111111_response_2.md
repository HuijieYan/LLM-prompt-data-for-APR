The bug in the `_recache` function is that it always sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes markers to not appear as hollow even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Correctly set _filled based on _fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the value of `self._fillstyle` and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly, this corrected version of the function will ensure that markers appear hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none', as expected by the users.
