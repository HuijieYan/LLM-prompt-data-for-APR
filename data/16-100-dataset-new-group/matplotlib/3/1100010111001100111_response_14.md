The issue is that the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the `fillstyle='none'` parameter, leading to the markers not being hollow as expected.

The bug is caused by the `_recache` function setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the specified `fillstyle`. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should check the value of `fillstyle` and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the value of `fillstyle`, the corrected version ensures that the markers are filled only when the fillstyle is not 'none', addressing the issue described in the GitHub report.
