The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute when the `_marker_function` is called. This leads to markers not being set as hollow even when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`. To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is not equal to 'none', we set `_filled` to `True`, indicating that the marker should be filled. Otherwise, if `self._fillstyle` is 'none', we set `_filled` to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. This change ensures that the `fillstyle` parameter is correctly reflected in the `_filled` attribute, fixing the bug where markers were not set to be hollow as expected.
