The potential error in the buggy function is that it does not set the fillstyle correctly, resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class does not properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter, which results in the markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and set the marker to be hollow when the fillstyle is 'none'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = None  # Resetting the path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With the correction above, the `MarkerStyle` class will correctly handle the fillstyle parameter, ensuring that the marker is hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This correction should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass, as well as address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
