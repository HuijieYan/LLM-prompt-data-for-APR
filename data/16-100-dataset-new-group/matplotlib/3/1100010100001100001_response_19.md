The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset certain attributes of the object when the marker function is not None. However, the function fails to reset the `_filled` attribute correctly.

The bug is caused by setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of its original value. This can lead to incorrect behavior when the marker function is called.

To fix the bug, we should preserve the original value of the `_filled` attribute and only reset it if necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Preserve the original value of _filled if it exists
    if hasattr(self, '_filled'):
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
