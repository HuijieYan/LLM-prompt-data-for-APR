The buggy function is causing the `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail with an assertion error. The error message indicates that the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True` instead of the expected `False` when `is_filled` is called.

The bug is likely caused by the `is_filled` method not behaving as expected when the `_recache` function is called. The `_recache` function initializes various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object, but it does not directly handle the logic related to the fillstyle.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to properly handle the logic related to `is_filled` based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Adjust filled state based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the bug should be fixed, and the `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass without any assertion errors.
