The buggy function fails to properly update the state of the `MarkerStyle` object, which leads to the failing test. The `MarkerStyle` object's `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result.

To fix this, the `_recache` function needs to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` property.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Properly set the _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() in ('full', 'left', 'right'):
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the `MarkerStyle` object will now correctly report whether it is filled or not, which will resolve the failing test.
