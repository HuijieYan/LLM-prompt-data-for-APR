The bug in the `_recache` function is that it doesn't correctly set the fillstyle of the marker when calling the `_marker_function`.

The `_recache` function is supposed to update the marker attributes, but it doesn't properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute. This causes the tests to fail because the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class does not return the expected value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` function properly updates the fillstyle attribute when calling the `_marker_function`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function now correctly updates the filled attribute based on the fillstyle, and the failing test should pass.
