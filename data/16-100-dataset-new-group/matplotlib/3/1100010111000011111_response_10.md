The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking whether it exists or not. This results in an AttributeError when the `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix this bug, we should check whether the `_marker_function` is defined before calling it. If it is not defined, we should simply return from the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function:
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected function, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass.

The corrected version addresses the issue posted on GitHub where the markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to 'none'. This fix ensures that the marker function is only called if it exists, preventing the AttributeError when calling an undefined function.
