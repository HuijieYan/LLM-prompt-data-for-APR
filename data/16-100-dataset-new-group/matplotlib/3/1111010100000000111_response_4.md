## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class, and it is supposed to recompute certain attributes based on the marker style. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the `fillstyle` parameter not working as expected when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle`.

## Potential error locations:
The issue could be related to the `_marker_function` not being defined or not behaving as expected.

## Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` is being called without checking if it exists or without providing the expected behavior to make the `fillstyle` work as intended.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` exists and is properly defined to handle the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `_marker_function` does not exist or does not handle the `fillstyle` as expected, it needs to be modified or overridden.

## Corrected version:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            if hasattr(self, '_marker_function') and callable(self._marker_function):  # Check if _marker_function exists and is callable
                self._marker_function()  # Call _marker_function if it exists and is callable
        else:
            self._filled = False  # Set filled to False if _marker_function is not defined or None
```

In the corrected version, we have added a conditional check to ensure that the `_marker_function` exists and is callable before trying to call it. Additionally, if the `_marker_function` does not exist, we set the `_filled` attribute to False to ensure that the marker is rendered as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle`.
