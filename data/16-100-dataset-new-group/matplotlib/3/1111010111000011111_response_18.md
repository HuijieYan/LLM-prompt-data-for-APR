To fix the function, we need to ensure that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the marker will be hollow as expected. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = self._marker_function()
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
```
