The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False`, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on the fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.

This fix also aligns with the GitHub issue, where the user expected to create hollow markers by setting the `fillstyle` to `'none', which is now resolved with the corrected `_recache` function.
