To fix the buggy function, we need to modify the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute. Based on the failing test and the error message, it seems that the `is_filled` method is returning the wrong value.

### Bug Explanation:
The issue lies in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Fix:
We need to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is equal to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Updated _recache Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

Now, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
