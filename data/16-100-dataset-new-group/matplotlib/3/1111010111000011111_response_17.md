## The cause of the bug
The buggy function `_recache` in the class `MarkerStyle` is failing to reset the marker properties as expected, resulting in the markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The failing test function `test_marker_fillstyle` checks for the fillstyle of a marker, and it fails because the `is_filled` method returns `True` when it should be returning `False`. This behavior is consistent with the reported GitHub issue where the user wants to set markers as hollow but is unable to achieve it with the current implementation.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class must properly reset the marker properties based on the provided input. Specifically, when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `_filled` property should be set to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow. Additionally, the `_path` property should be updated to reflect the changes in marker style.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path, _ = self._marker_function()
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
```

By updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` and setting the `_path` to the appropriate marker path, the corrected version of the function will ensure that the markers are properly rendered as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion as well as passing the failing test.
