The cause of the bug is that the _filled attribute is being set to False in the _recache function, but it should be set to True. This causes the is_filled() method to return False when it should return True.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to correctly set the _filled attribute to True.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Update to set _filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly set the _filled attribute to True, and the failing test should pass.
