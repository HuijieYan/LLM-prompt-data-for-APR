The issue here is that the `_recache` function does not correctly set the `_filled` variable to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. As a result, markers are not hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'` in the `ax.scatter` function.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the markers are rendered as hollow as expected.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub where setting `fillstyle='none'` in the `ax.scatter` function did not result in hollow markers.
