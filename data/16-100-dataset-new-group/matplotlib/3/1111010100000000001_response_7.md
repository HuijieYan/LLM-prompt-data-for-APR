## Correction:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._update_path()
        self._update_transform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the buggy function, the `_path` and `_transform` attributes are being set to `_empty_path` and `IdentityTransform()` respectively, but the methods `_update_path` and `_update_transform` are also present in the class and should be used to update these attributes. This is most likely the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we have replaced the assignment statements with calls to the `_update_path` and `_update_transform` methods to correctly update the `_path` and `_transform` attributes.

This corrected version of the function makes use of the appropriate methods within the class to update the necessary attributes, ensuring that the correct values are assigned and the bug is fixed.
