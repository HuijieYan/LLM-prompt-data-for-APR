The bug in the _recache function seems to occur when the _filled attribute is incorrectly set to False instead of the expected True value. This could be causing the function to behave unexpectedly.

To fix this bug, we can simply set the _filled attribute to True before calling the _marker_function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Set _filled attribute to True
    self._marker_function()
```
