## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the test code

The buggy function is part of the matplotlib package and is responsible for recaching the marker attributes. It sets various attributes to default values and then calls a marker function. The failing test is related to the `fillstyle` attribute of a marker, which suggests that the bug might be related to the setting of the marker fill style.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the setting of the `_filled` attribute and the call to `_marker_function`.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug is likely caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally, which may not be correct when dealing with markers with `fillstyle='none'`. Additionally, the call to `_marker_function` may not be handling the `fillstyle` correctly.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` and ensure that the `_marker_function` handles the `fillstyle` correctly.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Setting filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function(self._fillstyle)  # Passing fillstyle to marker function
```

In the corrected version, we set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, and we pass the `fillstyle` to the `_marker_function` for handling.
