The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` as expected, which is causing the failing test. The potential location of the bug is the line `self._filled = True` within the `_recache` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` as expected. We also need to verify that the `marker_function()` is correctly called and sets any other necessary attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function:
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding a condition to check if `self._marker_function` exists before calling it, we ensure that it is only called if it is defined. This will prevent potential errors and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
