The bug in this function is that the `_filled` variable is being set to `False` instead of `True` when it should be set to `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` variable is set to `True` as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Setting _filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
