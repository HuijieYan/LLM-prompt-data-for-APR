The buggy function `_recache` is failing because it is calling `self._marker_function()` without first checking if the function exists. This is causing an error to be raised when attempting to call the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object, as it is not able to properly update the required attributes.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self._marker_function` exists before attempting to call it. If it does not, we can return from the function early.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if hasattr(self, '_marker_function') and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the bug should be resolved.
