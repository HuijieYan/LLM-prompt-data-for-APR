## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

The bug in the original function is that it is returning when `self._marker_function` is not `None`, which is the opposite condition of what was intended. It should only continue if `self._marker_function` is not `None`. By changing the `if` condition to `if self._marker_function is not None`, the bug is fixed.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
