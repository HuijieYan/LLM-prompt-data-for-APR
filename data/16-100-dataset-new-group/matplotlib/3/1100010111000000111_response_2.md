## Buggy Function Analysis
The `_recache` function is meant to update the internal state of the `MarkerStyle` object, but it seems to be failing to properly re-initialize the object. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to create a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and expects it to return 'none' when `get_fillstyle()` is called, but it fails.

## Error Locations
The issue is likely in the `_recache` function where it is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` irrespective of the value of `fillstyle`, causing the test to fail.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the `fillstyle` to not be properly handled when creating the `MarkerStyle` object, resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `_recache` function needs to be modified to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and update the internal state of the `MarkerStyle` object accordingly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that the markers are properly rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and also allow the `test_marker_fillstyle` to pass successfully.
