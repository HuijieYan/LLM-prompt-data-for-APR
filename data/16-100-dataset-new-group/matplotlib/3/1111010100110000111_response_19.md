## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the class `MarkerStyle` is supposed to update the marker style attributes and call the marker function. However, it is not correctly handling the `filled` attribute and the call to `is_filled` is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The error message from the failing test indicates that when the `is_filled` method is called on the marker style object, it is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The GitHub issue confirms that setting `fillstyle='none'` is not resulting in hollow markers as expected, which aligns with the behavior seen in the failing test.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue is likely related to the handling of the `filled` attribute and potentially the way the `_marker_function` is being called.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `is_filled` method is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` attribute and is always returning `True` even when `fillstyle='none'` is set. This is causing the failing test and the behavior described in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by updating the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute. Additionally, the way the `_marker_function` is called might need to be reviewed to ensure it is correctly updating the marker style based on the `fillstyle` attribute.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function to update marker style
```
In the corrected version, the `filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` using the `get_fillstyle` method, and then the `_marker_function` is called to update the marker style accordingly. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
