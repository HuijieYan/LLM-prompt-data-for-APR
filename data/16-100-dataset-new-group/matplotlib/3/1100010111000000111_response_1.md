The issue in the `_recache` function is that the `_marker_function` is being called without any checks or validation. The code should first check if the `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

The test `test_marker_fillstyle` fails because the `fillstyle` property is not being properly handled in the `_recache` function.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to handle the `fillstyle` property and add a check for the existence of the `_marker_function` before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
  
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected `_recache` function, the `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
