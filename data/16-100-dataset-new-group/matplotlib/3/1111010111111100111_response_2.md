To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `_recache` to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `fillstyle` and updating `_filled` based on it, the corrected function should now accurately reflect whether the marker is filled or not.

This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub, in which the markers weren't hollow when the `fillstyle` was set to 'none'.

Now the function should correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and the test function `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass without raising an assertion error. The correction ultimately resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
