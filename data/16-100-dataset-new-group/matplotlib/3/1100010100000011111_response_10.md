To fix the bug in the _recache function, we need to ensure that the _marker_function is called correctly to update the marker properties as intended. The current implementation of the function is not correctly calling the _marker_function.

We can fix the bug by calling the _recache function within the __init__ method to ensure that the _marker_function is called when the MarkerStyle is initialized.

Here, we provide a corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = self._transform.transform_path(self.get_path())
        self._snap_threshold = np.inf
        self._transform = self._transform.frozen()
        self._alt_path = (None if self._alt_transform is None else
                         self._alt_transform.transform_path(self.get_path()))
        self._alt_transform = (None if self._alt_transform is None else
                              self._alt_transform.frozen())

        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'

        self._caps = {'butt': 'butt', 'projecting': 'projecting', 'round': 'round'}

        self._marker_function()
```

By calling the _marker_function in the _recache function and updating the marker properties accordingly, we ensure that the marker style is correctly applied when used in the scatter plot. This will resolve the GitHub issue where the markers were not hollow when the fillstyle was set to 'none'.
