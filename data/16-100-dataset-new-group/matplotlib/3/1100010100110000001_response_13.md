## Analysis
The `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result in the failing test. This method is related to the `_recache` function provided, as it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` by default. This might be causing the issue with the `is_filled` method.

## Potential Error Location
The assignment `self._filled = True` inside the `_recache` function might be causing the issue with the `is_filled` method.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the default assignment of `self._filled = True` inside the `_recache` function. This default assignment makes the `is_filled` method always return `True` regardless of the actual fillstyle.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute should not be set to `True` by default inside the `_recache` function. Instead, it should be set based on the fillstyle specified. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct result based on the fillstyle.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
    self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the specified fillstyle. If the fillstyle is not 'none', then `_filled` is set to `True`; otherwise, it is set to `False`. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct result based on the fillstyle specified.
