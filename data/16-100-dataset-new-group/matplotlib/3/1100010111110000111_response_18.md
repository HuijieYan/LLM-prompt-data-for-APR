## Explanation:

The bug in the `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is defined or not. This causes the `MarkerStyle` object to not be initialized correctly, resulting in the failing test.

## Fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is defined before calling it. If it is not defined, we should return from the function without performing any further operations.

## The corrected version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function:
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `MarkerStyle` object should be initialized correctly, and the failing test should pass. This fix also addresses the issue raised on GitHub about markers not appearing hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
