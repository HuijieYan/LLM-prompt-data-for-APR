To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. Currently, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the buggy function, which is incorrect.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `self._filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` value. This will ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the markers will be hollow as expected. The corrected function should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
