## Fixing the bug

The issue seems to be related to the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. This method returns the opposite of what is expected, resulting in the failing test. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `is_filled()` method to return the correct value.

Additionally, the `_marker_function` is being called without checking if it exists or not. This could also lead to unexpected behavior. We need to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = np.inf  # Assign 'inf' as numpy's infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False for hollow markers
        self._marker_function()
```

With these changes, the `is_filled()` method should return the correct value, and the `_marker_function` is only called if it exists and is callable. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test passes.
