## Potential issues with the buggy function

1. The `_marker_function` attribute is being called without checking if it exists, which can lead to a `NoneType` object error if it has not been initialized.
2. The method `is_filled()` is returning `False` when it should be returning `True` according to the failing test.

## Cause of the bug

The bug arises from the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. When the method is called, it initializes certain attributes and then calls the `_marker_function` without checking if it exists. This can lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not properly set. Additionally, the `is_filled()` method is returning the wrong value, which is causing the failing test.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it to avoid potential errors.
2. Ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value according to the failing test.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
