## Analysis
The issue described on GitHub states that the markers are not hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' using the markers.MarkerStyle. This indicates that the _recache function in markers.py is not properly handling the fillstyle parameter when creating marker styles.

## Potential Error Locations
The _recache function is responsible for setting the marker properties, and it is likely the source of the bug. Specifically, the _filled attribute being set to True may be conflicting with the intended fillstyle='none' setting.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the _recache function not properly handling the fillstyle parameter. When fillstyle is set to 'none', it should create a hollow marker, but due to the _filled attribute being set to True in the function, it overrides the fillstyle setting.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the _recache function to properly handle the fillstyle parameter. When fillstyle is set to 'none', the _filled attribute should be set to False to create a hollow marker.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we check if the fillstyle is set to 'none' and set the _filled attribute accordingly. This will ensure that when a custom MarkerStyle with fillstyle='none' is used, the marker will appear hollow as intended.
