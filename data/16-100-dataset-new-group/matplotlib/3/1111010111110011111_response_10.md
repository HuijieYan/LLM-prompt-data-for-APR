## The buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, the expected input/output values, the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with the `fillstyle` parameter set to `'none'` and checks if the `is_filled` method returns `False`. The failing test expects that setting `fillstyle` to `'none'` should make the marker hollow.

However, the current implementation of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the failing test to fail.

The GitHub issue related to this bug indicates that users are trying to set markers as hollow by using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle='none'`, but it's not producing the expected behavior.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

The current implementation does not take into account the `fillstyle` parameter, and unconditionally sets `_filled` to `True`. This is the potential cause of the bug.

## Cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function does not properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter when recalculating the marker attributes. As a result, the `is_filled` method always returns `True`, even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the marker is hollow.

## The corrected version

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, when recalculating the marker attributes in the `_recache` function, it checks the `fillstyle` using the `get_fillstyle` method and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False`, otherwise it is set to `True`. This change ensures that the marker is hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none',` and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
