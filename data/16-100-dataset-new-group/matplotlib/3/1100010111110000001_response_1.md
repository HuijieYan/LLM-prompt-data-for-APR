The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be related to the function not setting the `self._filled` attribute properly, which leads to the `is_filled` method returning `True` even when it shouldn't.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `self._filled` attribute is set correctly based on the fillstyle of the marker.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Set the filled attribute based on the fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `is_filled()` method should now return the correct value based on the fillstyle of the marker, and the failing test should pass.
