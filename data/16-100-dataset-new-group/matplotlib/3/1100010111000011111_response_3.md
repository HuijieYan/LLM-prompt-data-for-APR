## Corrections

The issue is that the function _recache is not properly setting the marker to be hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The _recache function needs to handle this case by updating the _filled parameter based on the fillstyle.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check for the fillstyle in the _recache function. If the fillstyle is set to 'none', then the _filled parameter should be set to False.

Here is the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will correctly set the _filled parameter based on the fillstyle, and the failing test case will be satisfied. This will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub where markers were not showing as hollow when the fillstyle was set to 'none'.
