The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `marker_function` is being called without `self` as an argument. This means that the function doesn't have access to the `MarkerStyle` instance, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, the `marker_function` should take `self` as an argument.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function(self)
```

With this correction, the `marker_function` will have access to the `MarkerStyle` instance and the failing test should pass.
