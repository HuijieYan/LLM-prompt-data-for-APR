## Analysis
The `_recache` function updates the marker style attributes based on a marker function. The issue seems to be with the call to `_marker_function()` as it is not properly implemented or defined, leading to a failure in the `test_marker_fillstyle()` test.

## Identification of Potential Error
The potential error lies in the implementation of the `_marker_function`. It is not defined correctly, thus leading to a failed test.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incomplete or incorrect implementation of the `_marker_function()` within the `_recache` function. Due to this, the marker style attributes are not updated as expected, leading to a failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Define and implement the `_marker_function` method to properly update the marker style attributes.
2. Ensure that the `marker_function` is defined correctly and returns the expected values.
3. Call the `marker_function` with appropriate arguments or context to properly update the marker style attributes.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version with the implementation of _marker_function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function(self)  # Pass the instance of MarkerStyle as an argument
```

In the corrected version, the `_marker_function` is called with `self` passed as an argument, enabling it to update the marker style attributes properly.

With this correction, the `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully.
