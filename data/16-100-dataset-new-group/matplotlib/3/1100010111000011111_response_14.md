The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` module of `matplotlib` library is failing to properly handle the fillstyle parameter for markers, causing them to not appear as hollow when expected.

The potential error location lies in the `_recache` function, specifically in the handling of the `_filled` variable. Currently, the function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the fillstyle parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function does not properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter, leading to markers not appearing as hollow when expected.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be updated to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` variable accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` variable is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing for proper handling of markers appearing as hollow when expected. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the markers appear as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
