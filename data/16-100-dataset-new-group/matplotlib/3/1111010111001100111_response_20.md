Based on the code provided and the failing test, as well as the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The failing test specifically checks for the fillstyle of the marker, and based on the provided information, it appears that when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, the marker is still being filled.

To fix this issue, the `_recache` method needs to be modified to properly handle the case where the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = self._marker_function()
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
```
In the corrected version, the `_recache` method now uses the result of the marker function to set the path of the marker. Additionally, the filled attribute is set based on the fillstyle, ensuring that when the fillstyle is 'none', the marker will not be filled.

This should fix the issue described in the failing test and addressed in the GitHub issue. The marker should now be hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
