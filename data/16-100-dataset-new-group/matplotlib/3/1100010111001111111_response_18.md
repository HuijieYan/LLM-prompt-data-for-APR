## Correction

The issue seems to be with the `_filled` property not being set to `True` when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`. This is causing the markers to not be hollow as expected.

The correction can be made by modifying the `_recache` function to set `_filled` to `False` when the fillstyle is `'none'`, and to `True` for any other fillstyle.

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` property will be set to `True` for any fillstyle other than `'none'`, and it will be set to `False` when the fillstyle is `'none'.

This correction should address the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the markers are hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none'.
