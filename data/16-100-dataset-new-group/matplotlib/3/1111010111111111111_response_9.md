The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` as expected, which is causing the failing test.

The bug is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` instead of `False` as expected. This is because the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should set the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `is_filled` method should correctly return `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none',` and the failing test should pass. This also resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when setting `fillstyle` to `'none'`.
