The potential error in the buggy function is that the _filled attribute should be set to False when fillstyle is set to 'none', but the buggy function is setting it to True in all cases.

The cause of the bug is that the _filled attribute is set to True unconditionally in the _recache function, which is not correct when the fillstyle is 'none'. This causes the markers to be filled even when the fillstyle is set to 'none', leading to the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _recache function to check if the fillstyle is 'none' before setting the _filled attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will now correctly set the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle, and the failing test case and the issue reported on GitHub will be resolved.
