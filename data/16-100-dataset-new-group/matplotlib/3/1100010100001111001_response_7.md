The bug in the function `_recache` is that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally, which does not match the expected values.

To fix this bug, we should set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `_fillstyle` attribute. If the `_fillstyle` is `'none'`, then the `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function now sets the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `_fillstyle`, which should match the expected behavior.
