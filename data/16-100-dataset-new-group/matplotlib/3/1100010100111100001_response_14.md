The bug in the _recache function is that it resets the value of self._filled to True, which is causing the failing test on the is_filled method.

The cause of the bug is that the _recache function sets the self._filled to True unconditionally, regardless of the original value of fillstyle.

To fix the bug, we should update the _recache function to set the self._filled attribute based on the fillstyle value. If the fillstyle is 'none', then the marker should not be filled (i.e., self._filled should be False).

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will now correctly set the self._filled attribute based on the fillstyle value, and the failing test should pass.
