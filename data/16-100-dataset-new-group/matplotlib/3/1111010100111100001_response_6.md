## Buggy Function Analysis
The `_recache` function is an internal method of the `MarkerStyle` class. It is supposed to recalculate the marker's properties based on any changes made to its style. The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class after setting the fillstyle to `'none'`.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely occurring in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the fillstyle.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always being set to `True` within the `_recache` function, irrespective of the fillstyle set for the marker. This results in incorrect behavior when the `is_filled` method is called, leading to failing tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is assigned based on the fillstyle provided during the construction of the `MarkerStyle` class. This can be achieved by correctly updating the `_filled` attribute within the `_recache` function based on the fillstyle.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Update the _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle in ('full', 'left', 'right'):
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, we update the `_filled` attribute based on the provided fillstyle, ensuring that it reflects the actual fill behavior of the marker. This should address the failing test case and fix the bug.
