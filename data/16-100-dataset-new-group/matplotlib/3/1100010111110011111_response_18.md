## The buggy function and its relationship with the failing test

The buggy function `_recache` is called within the `MarkerStyle` class to reset the cached marker properties, such as the path, transform, snap threshold, join style, cap style, and filled status. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with marker type `o` and fillstyle `none`. It then checks if the fillstyle is set to `'none'` and if the marker is not filled. The buggy function `_recache` is causing the failing test to assert that the marker is filled when it should not be.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The issue seems to be related to the setter method for the fillstyle or the logic of `_recache`, potentially overriding the `fillstyle` setting.

## Explanation of the bug

The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` returns `True` when it should not, leading to an assertion error. This suggests that the `_recache` method is likely resetting the fillstyle or setting the filled status to `True` regardless of the specified fillstyle.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix this bug, the `_recache` method should be modified to correctly handle the fillstyle setting and ensure that it properly reflects the specified fillstyle when creating a `MarkerStyle` object. Additionally, the logic for the `is_filled` method may need to be updated to respect the fillstyle setting.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = self._marker_function()
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    # Update the fillstyle to reflect the specified fillstyle
    if self.fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
```
