The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the MarkerStyle to not be considered as unfilled when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is evident from the error message and the failing test case. The function sets the `_filled` variable to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect when the `fillstyle` is `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` and set the `_filled` variable accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then the marker should be considered unfilled.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle.lower() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we added a conditional check for the `fillstyle` to override the `_filled` variable. This condition checks if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` and if so, sets the `_filled` variable to `False`. Otherwise, it keeps the `_filled` variable as `True`.

This fix should address the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
