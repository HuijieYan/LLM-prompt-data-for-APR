## 1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with test code.
The buggy function `_recache` is called internally within the MarkerStyle class to update the marker properties. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a MarkerStyle object and tests the `get_fillstyle` and `is_filled` methods.

## 2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
The potential error locations in the `_recache` function are related to setting the marker properties and invoking the `_marker_function`, which is not provided in the buggy code.

## 3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the failing test.
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function sets certain properties of the marker but fails to define the `_marker_function` to actually update the marker attributes, causing the MarkerStyle to not work as expected when instantiated with specific fillstyles.

## 4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
The strategy for fixing the bug would be to define the `_marker_function` within the MarkerStyle class and ensure that it handles the updates to the marker attributes based on the specified marker and fillstyle.

## 5. Corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function(self)
```

In the corrected version, the `_marker_function` is called with the `self` argument to update the marker properties. This ensures that the MarkerStyle is correctly updated when instantiated with specific fillstyles.
