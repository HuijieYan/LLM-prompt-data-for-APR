The bug in the `_recache` function appears to be related to the `is_filled` method that is being called within the function but is not returning the expected value. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning True when it should not.

This indicates that the `_recache` function is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute to False even when the `fillstyle` argument is set to 'none' in the `MarkerStyle` class.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to False when the `fillstyle` argument is set to 'none'.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Set _filled to False if fillstyle is 'none'
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` argument, and the failing test should now pass.
