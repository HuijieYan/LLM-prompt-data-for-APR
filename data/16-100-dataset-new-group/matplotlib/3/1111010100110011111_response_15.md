## The analysis

### Buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class
The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. It is responsible for caching the marker properties to avoid recalculating them every time they are required. The bug seems to be related to the `_filled` property not being set correctly when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`.

### The cause of the bug
The failing test is checking the behavior of the `MarkerStyle` class when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. The expected behavior is that the marker should not be filled. However, in the buggy function `_recache`, the `_filled` property is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Potential error locations
The bug is likely related to the condition checking and setting of the `_filled` property within the `_recache` method.

### GitHub issue
The GitHub issue describes the user's expectation of getting hollow markers when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`, but currently, this is not happening.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by updating the logic within the `_recache` method to correctly set the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

### The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated logic to consider the fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the logic to set the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the `_recache` method should now properly handle the case where `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This will address the GitHub issue and ensure that the test case for `is_filled()` passes.
