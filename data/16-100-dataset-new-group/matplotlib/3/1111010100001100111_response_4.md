Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it seems that the issue is related to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` by default, even if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This causes the markers to be filled instead of hollow as intended.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to check the value of `fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we added a conditional statement to check if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. If it is, then `_filled` is set to `False`, ensuring that the markers will be hollow.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub where setting `fillstyle` to `'none' did not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.
