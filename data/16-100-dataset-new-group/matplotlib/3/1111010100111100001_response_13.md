The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be that it does not correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style. This is evident from the failing test, which checks whether the marker is filled when the fill style is set to `'none'`.

The `_marker_function` method is intended to update the attributes based on the marker style, but it seems to be failing to update the `_filled` attribute correctly.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the fill style in the `MarkerStyle` class. This can be done by adding a conditional check in the `_recache` function to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the fill style, and the failing test should now pass.
