## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle` object and setting `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
The cause of the bug could be related to the way the `_recache` function handles the `fillstyle` parameter and the `_marker_function` that is called. The default behavior of the function may not be taking the specified `fillstyle` into account when rendering the markers.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the fact that the `_recache` function is not correctly applying the `fillstyle` parameter when the `_marker_function` is called.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should take the `fillstyle` parameter into account and correctly render the markers based on the specified `fillstyle`. This may involve modifying the logic within the function to honor the `fillstyle` parameter when calling the `_marker_function`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')  # Update the filled status based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, so that it correctly reflects whether the marker should be filled or not. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub where the markers were not appearing hollow as expected.
