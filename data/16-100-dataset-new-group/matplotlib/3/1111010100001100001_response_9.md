The bug appears to be in the `_marker_function` call at the end of the `_recache` function. This call does not seem to have any conditional check for `_fillstyle`, even though the input parameter is included.

To fix the bug, we should add a conditional check for the `_fillstyle` parameter and ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called when the fill style is not equal to 'none'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._fillstyle != 'none':
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check for `_fillstyle`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called when the fill style is not 'none', thus fixing the bug.
