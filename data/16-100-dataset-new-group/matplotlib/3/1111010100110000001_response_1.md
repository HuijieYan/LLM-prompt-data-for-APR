The issue in the code is that the _marker_function() is called without having been defined, which causes the failing test. The _marker_function() should be defined and called within the _recache() method.

To fix this bug, we need to define the _marker_function() within the MarkerStyle class and call it within the _recache() method after setting the marker properties.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _marker_function(self):
        # Define the marker function here
        pass

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
