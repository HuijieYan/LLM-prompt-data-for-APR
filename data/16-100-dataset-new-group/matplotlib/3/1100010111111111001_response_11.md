The buggy function `_recache` is not setting the `self._filled` attribute to `True` as expected when the `marker_function` is called. This is causing the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class to return `False` when it should return `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set `self._filled` to `True` before calling `self._marker_function`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # setting the filled attribute to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should now pass, and the `is_filled` method should return `True` as expected.
