The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` incorrectly. This is evident from the failing test where `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` is not passing.

The cause of the bug is that when `marker_function` is called, it is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class, leading to incorrect behavior in the `is_filled` method.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass. This correction will also address the issue reported on GitHub.
