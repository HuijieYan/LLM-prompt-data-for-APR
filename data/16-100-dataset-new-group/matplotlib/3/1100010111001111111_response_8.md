## Fixing the bug

The bug seems to be related to the `fillstyle` not being correctly set to 'none' in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. When `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker should be hollow, but the `is_filled` method incorrectly returns `False`. The `_recache` function also sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `fillstyle` parameter is correctly handled in the `_recache` function and that the `_filled` attribute reflects the actual filling state based on the `fillstyle` value.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class will accurately reflect whether the marker is filled based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This should ensure that setting `fillstyle='none'` results in a hollow marker as expected.

It is also important to mention that there might be a need to update the public API to include a `get_fillstyle` method to retrieve the `fillstyle` attribute value, and also ensure that the `is_filled` method correctly reflects the filling state of the marker based on the `fillstyle` value.
