## The fixed version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# the fixed function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

## A brief summary of the bug and fix
The bug occurs because the `_filled` variable is always set to `True` in the original function, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. The fix involves setting `_filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle` to correctly reflect whether the markers should be filled or not.

By making this change, the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` will be resolved. Now, when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()` with `fillstyle='none'`, the markers will be hollow as expected.
