To fix the bug in the _recache function, we need to ensure that the _filled variable is set to False when the fillstyle is 'none'. We also need to update the _filled variable to True when the fillstyle is not 'none'.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function ensures that the _filled variable is set according to the fillstyle, and it should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix also addresses the issue posted on GitHub, where markers were not appearing as hollow when the fillstyle was set to 'none'.

This fix checks if the fillstyle is 'none' and sets _filled to False accordingly. If the fillstyle is not 'none', _filled is set to True.
