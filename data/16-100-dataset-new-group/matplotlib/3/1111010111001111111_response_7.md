To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this update, when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker will be hollow (not filled) as expected.

This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub, where the user expected the markers to be hollow when using `fillstyle='none'`. This fix changes the behavior of the `MarkerStyle` class so that it aligns with the user's expectations and resolves the issue reported.
