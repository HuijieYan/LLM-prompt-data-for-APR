## Analysis
The buggy function _recache() is not correctly setting the _filled attribute to True, resulting in the is_filled method returning the wrong value.

## Bug location
The bug seems to be located in the _recache() function where the _filled attribute is being set to True.

## Cause of the bug
The _filled attribute is being set to True in the _recache() function, but the failing test is expecting the marker to have a fillstyle of 'none' which means it should not be filled. This discrepancy is causing the AssertionError.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The _recache() function needs to properly handle the setting of the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle specified for the marker.

## The corrected function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```
By updating the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle, the corrected function can properly handle markers with different fillstyles.

This correction should ensure that the marker's fillstyle is correctly reflected in the _filled attribute, passing the failing test.
