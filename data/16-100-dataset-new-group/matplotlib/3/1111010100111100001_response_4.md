The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the failing test. The expected outcome is for the `is_filled` method to return False when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. However, the current implementation of the function is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` is called without updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` before calling the `_marker_function` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled attribute based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the `fillstyle` before calling the `_marker_function` method. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value according to the `fillstyle`, and the failing test should pass.
