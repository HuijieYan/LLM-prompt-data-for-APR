The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be that it is not correctly setting the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. In the failing test, the `marker_style` object is created with `fillstyle='none'`, which should result in `is_filled()` returning `False`. However, the `filled` attribute is being set to `True` inside the `_recache` function, causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` instead.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the `_recache` function to correctly set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle not in ['none', 'full']
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test should now pass.
