The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior of a marker with `fillstyle='none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the marker's fillstyle is checked, and the `_filled` attribute is updated accordingly, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
