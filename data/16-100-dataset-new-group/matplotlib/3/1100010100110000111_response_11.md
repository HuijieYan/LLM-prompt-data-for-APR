## Identification of potential error locations:
The issue seems to be related to the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is not returning the expected result when `fillstyle` is set to `none`.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The `is_filled` method is likely not correctly handling the case when `fillstyle` is set to `none`. This could be due to the `MarkerStyle` class not updating its internal state properly when the `fillstyle` is set to `none`.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
The `MarkerStyle` class needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when `fillstyle` is set to `none`. This may involve updating the `_recache` method to properly handle the `fillstyle` property and ensuring that the `is_filled` method returns the correct result in all cases.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
  
    # Update filled property based on fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```
