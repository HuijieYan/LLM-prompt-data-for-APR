The issue seems to be with the `_filled` attribute not being updated correctly, which is why the `is_filled()` method is returning the wrong value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter when the `_recache` method is called.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute to be based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, the `is_filled()` method should now return the correct value and the failing test should pass.
