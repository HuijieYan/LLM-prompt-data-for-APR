The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is directly calling `self._marker_function` without any checks. This could potentially lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not defined or if it is not a callable function.

To fix this bug, we should add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `self._marker_function` to ensure it exists and is callable before calling it. If the check passes, the function proceeds to set the values of the variables as expected.
