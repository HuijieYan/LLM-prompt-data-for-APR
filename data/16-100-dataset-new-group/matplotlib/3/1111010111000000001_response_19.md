## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class. It is supposed to recache some properties of the marker style, but there are potential error locations within this function related to the use of `self._marker_function` and calling it without checking if it's callable. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks the `fillstyle` of a marker, so the bug might be related to how the `_filled` property is being set in the `_recache` function.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function is calling `self._marker_function` without checking if it's callable. This leads to an error when trying to call a non-existent or non-callable function, causing the function to fail. Additionally, the `_filled` property is always being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `self._marker_function` is callable before calling it.
2. Modify the logic for setting the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if callable(self._marker_function):  # Check if _marker_function is callable
            self._marker_function()
        
        # Set _filled based on fillstyle
        supported_fillstyles = ['full', 'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top']
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() in supported_fillstyles

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
```
