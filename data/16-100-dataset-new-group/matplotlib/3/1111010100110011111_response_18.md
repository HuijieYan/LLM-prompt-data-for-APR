## The buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class
The `_recache` function is part of the `MarkerStyle` class. This function is intended to recalculate the marker style attributes based on the marker function. The issue is related to the `is_filled()` method not returning the expected result.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error location is the `_marker_function()` call, which is not being handled correctly, resulting in incorrect marker fillstyle.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the marker fillstyle when the `_marker_function` is called. This results in the `is_filled()` method returning the wrong value.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the `_marker_function` is correctly handled to set the marker fillstyle to 'none', as expected.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._marker_function()
        else:
            raise ValueError("_marker_function is not defined")
```
In the corrected version, I have added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. This will prevent any unexpected behavior when the function is called with an undefined marker function.
