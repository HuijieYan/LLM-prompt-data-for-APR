The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class seems to be failing because the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which is not expected.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not handling the `fillstyle` attribute properly, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should not.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `fillstyle` attribute is properly handled in the `_recache` function to reflect the correct filled state of the marker.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle not in ['none', 'left', 'right']  # Adjust the filled state based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function with the corrected code above, the `is_filled` method should return the expected results in the failing test.
