The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return the incorrect value.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is hardcoded to `True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the fillstyle specified during initialization. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle in ('full', 'none'):
            self._filled = True if self._fillstyle == 'full' else False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

This correction will correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified during initialization, and the failing test should now pass.
