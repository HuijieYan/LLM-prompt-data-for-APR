## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Corrected line
        self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original code was that the `_filled` attribute was always being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. In the corrected code, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `fillstyle`, ensuring that markers will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. We do this by checking if the `fillstyle` is 'none' and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

The corrected version of the function sets `_filled` based on the value of `fillstyle`, ensuring that markers will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

This change should address the issue reported on GitHub where setting `fillstyle='none'` did not make the markers hollow when using `ax.scatter()`.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
