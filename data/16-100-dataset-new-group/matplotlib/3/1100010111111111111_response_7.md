The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This means that if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, it should result in a hollow marker, but the function is setting it to be filled.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, allowing markers to be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and make the failing test pass, satisfying the expected input/output values.
