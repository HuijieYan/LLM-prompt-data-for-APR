The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly setting the fillstyle and is not updating the filled attribute based on the fillstyle value.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `_marker_function()` does not handle the fillstyle attribute. As a result, the `is_filled()` method returns True because it only checks the `filled` attribute, which is always set to True regardless of the fillstyle.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the fillstyle attribute and update the filled attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to properly set the `filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`, we ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass.
