The buggy function `_recache` is called via the failing test function `test_marker_fillstyle()`. The failing test is checking for the condition `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` and it is failing with the error message `E       assert not True`.

The potential error location in the buggy function is that it is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object. This is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False` for the test to pass.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute, which causes the `is_filled()` method to return the wrong value.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle. This can be done by adding an `if` condition to check the fillstyle and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.fillstyle != 'full':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With the above correction, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided, and the failing test should pass as expected.
