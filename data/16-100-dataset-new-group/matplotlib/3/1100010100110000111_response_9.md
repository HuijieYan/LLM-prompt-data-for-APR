## Analysis
The error message is indicating that the `is_filled()` method is returning True when it should be False. This method is called within the `_recache` function, and it seems that the issue might be related to the setting of the `self._filled` attribute inside the `_recache` function.

## Error Location
The potential error locations within the function include the setting of the `_filled` attribute and the call to `self._marker_function()`. It's likely that the issue lies in the logic of setting `_filled` to True by default, which is contradictory to the intended behavior when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to True by default, which contradicts the intended behavior when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return True instead of False.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to False. Additionally, the `_marker_function()` should be called only when `self._marker_function` is not None.

## The corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and by ensuring that the `_marker_function()` is only called when it's not None, the bug can be fixed. This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
