The issue with the `MarkerStyle` class is that the `_recache` method is not properly setting the `_marker_function` attribute, resulting in the failing test.

Based on the error message, the `MarkerStyle` object's `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, indicating that the marker is filled when it should not be.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` attribute is properly set and called in the `_recache` method, allowing the marker's properties to be correctly updated.

Here's the fixed version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function if it's callable
```

By checking if `_marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it, we avoid any potential errors related to the incorrect usage of the attribute. This should result in the correct behaviors of the `MarkerStyle` object and passing the failing test.
