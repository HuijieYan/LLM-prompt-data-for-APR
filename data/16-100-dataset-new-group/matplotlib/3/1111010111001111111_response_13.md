## Correction Strategy
The bug seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute not being set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is causing the markers to not appear hollow as expected. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set according to the `fillstyle` when the `_recache` method is called.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # the corrected version of the _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False`, which should result in the markers appearing hollow as expected. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` passes.
