The bug in the provided function is that it does not correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to the `is_filled` method returning the wrong value, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to "none", then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be correctly updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test should pass. This will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
