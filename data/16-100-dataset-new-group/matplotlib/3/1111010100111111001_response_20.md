The buggy function `_recache` is failing to set the `self._filled` attribute to True, resulting in the `is_filled()` method returning False when it should return True.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._filled` is set to True before the `_marker_function()` is called.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Set filled to True before calling _marker_function
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute is correctly set to True before calling `_marker_function()`, ensuring that the `is_filled()` method will return the expected value.
