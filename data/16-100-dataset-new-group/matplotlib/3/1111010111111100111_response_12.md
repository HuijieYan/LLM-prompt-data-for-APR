To fix the bug in the given function, we need to ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the input `fillstyle`.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect setting of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` method. The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally, but it should depend on the `fillstyle`.

The `_fillstyle` attribute is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code. However, assuming that it is a class attribute, we will utilize it in our fix.

Here's a corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we utilize the `_fillstyle` attribute to determine the value of the `_filled` attribute.

By setting `_filled` based on the value of `_fillstyle`, the corrected version ensures that the correct fill behavior is achieved based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

This fix should resolve the failing test as well as the issue reported on GitHub.
