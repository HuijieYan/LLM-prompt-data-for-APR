The issue with the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class is that it calls the `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined, which results in a `NoneType` object being called.

To fix this bug, we need to include a condition to check if `_marker_function` is defined before calling it.

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Add a check to see if _marker_function is defined
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By including this condition, we prevent the `NoneType` object from being called, which resolves the bug.
