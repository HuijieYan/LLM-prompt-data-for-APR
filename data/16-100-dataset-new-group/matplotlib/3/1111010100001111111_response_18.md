## Fixing the Bug

The issue appears to be related to the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. It seems that the `_filled` attribute is being incorrectly set to `False` instead of `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and set the `_filled` attribute according to the specified fillstyle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none')
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set the `_filled` attribute to `True` if the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`. This will ensure that the markers are correctly filled or hollow based on the specified `fillstyle`.

By making this change, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the markers will be correctly rendered as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions or issues!
