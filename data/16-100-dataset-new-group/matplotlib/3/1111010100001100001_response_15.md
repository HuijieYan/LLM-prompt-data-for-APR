The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be related to the conditional check for `self._marker_function` being `None`. This condition should not prevent the other assignments from taking place.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function returns early if `self._marker_function` is `None`, but it still updates several other attributes regardless. This can lead to inconsistent states in the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should remove the conditional check for `self._marker_function` and ensure that all attribute assignments take place regardless of its value.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._marker_function()
```
