## Corrected version of the buggy function

The issue with the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call a function without checking if it exists or not. This can cause an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` will only be invoked if it exists, preventing the potential AttributeError.
