The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` at the end of the `_recache` function, but it should be set to `True` based on the failing test and the expected input/output variable values. To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute should be explicitly set to `True` at the end of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Set _filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
