## Analysis
The issue on GitHub is related to the markers not being displayed as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' using the markers.MarkerStyle. The provided buggy function is responsible for handling the marker properties, and it seems that it is not correctly applying the fillstyle parameter.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue may be with the implementation of the _marker_function() that is called at the end of the _recache function. It's likely that the _marker_function() is not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the fillstyle parameter within the _recache function. As a result, when a user sets the fillstyle to 'none' using markers.MarkerStyle, the markers are not displayed as hollow as expected.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the _recache function should be modified to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter. Additionally, the _marker_function() should be updated to ensure that it properly applies the fillstyle parameter when drawing the markers.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Updated to correctly handle fillstyle 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the line `self._filled = True` is updated to `self._filled = False` to ensure that when fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers will be displayed as hollow. This modification addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
