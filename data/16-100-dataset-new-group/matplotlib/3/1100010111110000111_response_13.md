## The analysis:
The `_recache` function is called when the `MarkerStyle` object is initialized with `fillstyle='none'`, but the function does not properly handle this case, resulting in the marker not being rendered as hollow as expected. This issue has been reported in a GitHub issue as well.

### Potential error locations:
The error is likely due to the `_recache` function not correctly handling the case when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

### Cause of the bug:
The `_recache` function sets the marker as filled, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the failing test and the unexpected marker rendering in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The `_recache` function should be modified to correctly handle the case when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This can be achieved by checking the fill style and updating the marker properties accordingly.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, the `if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':` statement is added to check if the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. If it is, then the `_filled` attribute is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be rendered as hollow. This change addresses the bug and aligns with the expected behavior of the `fillstyle` parameter.
