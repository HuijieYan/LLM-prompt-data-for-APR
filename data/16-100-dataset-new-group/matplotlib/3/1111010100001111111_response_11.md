## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = None  # Add the correct path creation logic based on the current marker style
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it sets self._filled to True unconditionally. This does not consider the fillstyle parameter and leads to incorrect behavior, where markers are not hollow even when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

To fix this, we need to update the _recache function to consider the fillstyle parameter when setting the _filled property. We can set _filled based on the value of _fillstyle, so that it is True when _fillstyle is not 'none', and False when _fillstyle is 'none'.

By making this change, the corrected function will correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that markers are hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none', as expected.

This should address the issue raised on GitHub, where markers were not hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting fillstyle to 'none'.
