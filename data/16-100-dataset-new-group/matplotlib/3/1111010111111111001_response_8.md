The buggy function is failing to set the `_filled` attribute to `True`, as observed from the failing test. When the `MarkerStyle` class is instantiated with `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute should be `False`. However, in the current implementation of the `_recache` function, the `_filled` attribute is always being set to `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `_recache` function to properly handle the `_fillstyle` attribute and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of `_fillstyle`, and the failing test is expected to pass.
