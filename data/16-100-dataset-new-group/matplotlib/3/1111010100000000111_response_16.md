## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for recaching the marker style attributes. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the fillstyle not working as expected when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()` with `fillstyle='none'`.

## Potential Error
The issue could be related to the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` attribute in the `_recache` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class. When `fillstyle='none'` is set and used with `ax.scatter()`, the expected behavior of having hollow markers is not achieved due to the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should be updated to properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are displayed as hollow.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        fillstyle = self.get_fillstyle()

        if fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_recache` function is updated to properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute. If `fillstyle='none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. Otherwise, `_filled` is set to `True`, allowing filled markers. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
