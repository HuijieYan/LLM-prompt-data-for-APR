The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not correctly handling the case when `self._marker_function` is None. This causes the function to not return early and try to call `self._marker_function` even when it is None, leading to a potential runtime error.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to see if `self._marker_function` is None and return early if it is. This will prevent the function from trying to call a non-existent function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will now correctly handle the case when `self._marker_function` is None and return early without trying to call a non-existent function.
