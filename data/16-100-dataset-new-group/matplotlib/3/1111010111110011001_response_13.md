### The buggy function
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recalculate the marker style attributes, such as the path, transform, snap threshold, join style, cap style, and filled status. However, the current implementation does not correctly update these attributes, leading to the failing test and the corresponding error message.

### Identify potential error locations
The bug is likely in the `_recache` function where the marker attributes are updated.

### Cause of the bug
The bug causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False`. The `is_filled` method checks the `self._filled` attribute, which is set to `True` in the `_recache` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly update the marker attributes in the `_recache` function.

### The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Update filled status to False
        self._marker_function()
```
With this correction, the `_recache` function properly sets the `filled` attribute to `False`, and the failing test should pass as expected.
