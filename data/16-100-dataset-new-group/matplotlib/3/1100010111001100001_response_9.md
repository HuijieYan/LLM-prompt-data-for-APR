The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not correctly setting the fillstyle of the marker. This is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail.

The bug is likely due to the fact that the `_fillstyle` attribute is not being properly updated within the `_recache` function.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `_fillstyle` attribute is correctly set within the `_recache` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will now be updated correctly based on the value of `_fillstyle`, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should now pass.
