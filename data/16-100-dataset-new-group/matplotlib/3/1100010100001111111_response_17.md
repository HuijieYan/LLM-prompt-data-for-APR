## Corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Changed from True to False to set markers as hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

By changing the `_filled` variable from `True` to `False` within the `_recache` function, it ensures that the markers are set as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
