The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be that even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker is still filled. Looking at the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, it creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle` set to 'none' and then checks if the fillstyle is set to 'none' and if the marker is not filled. However, in the buggy function, it does not take into account the `fillstyle` value while updating the `_filled` attribute.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` function should check the `fillstyle` attribute and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to False, indicating that the marker should not be filled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing the marker to be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well as make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass.
