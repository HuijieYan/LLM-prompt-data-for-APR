### Problem Analysis
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tries to create a MarkerStyle with the marker set to 'o' and fillstyle set to 'none', then checks if the fillstyle is 'none' and if the marker is not filled. The failing assertion indicates that the marker is filled when it should not be.

### Error Location
The issue seems to be with the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. This method resets the properties of the `MarkerStyle` before calling the `_marker_function`. However, the method does not consider the `fillstyle`, so the fillstyle is being ignored.

### Cause of the Bug
The `MarkerStyle` class does not take the `fillstyle` into account when recalculating the style, leading to the fillstyle being ignored. This causes the marker to be filled even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` method should also consider the `fillstyle` property when recalculating the style. If the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `_filled` property should be set to `False` to ensure that the marker is not filled.

### The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By incorporating the check for `fillstyle` in the `_recache` method, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass. This will also address the issue reported on GitHub.
