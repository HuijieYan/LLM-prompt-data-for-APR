The bug in the `_recache` function is that it assumes the `_marker_function` attribute is always defined, but does not check for its existence before calling it. This results in a AttributeError when trying to call `self._marker_function()`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function should no longer raise an AttributeError when the _marker_function is None.
