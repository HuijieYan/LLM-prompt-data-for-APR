## Analysis
The `_recache` function initializes some attributes and then calls the `_marker_function`, which is not defined within the function. This could be the potential cause of the issue reported in the GitHub bug, as the `_marker_function` might be responsible for setting the marker style and fill properties. So, the issue could be related to the incorrect usage of the `fillstyle` parameter in the custom `MarkerStyle`.

## Bug Cause
The bug causes the markers not to be hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'` in the custom `MarkerStyle`. This is because the `_marker_function` is not defined and hence does not handle changes to the fillstyle property.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to define the `_marker_function` to handle the changes to the fillstyle property and ensure that it is called when the marker attributes are recached. Additionally, we can update the function to make sure that the `fillstyle='none'` setting is correctly applied to achieve hollow markers.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```
