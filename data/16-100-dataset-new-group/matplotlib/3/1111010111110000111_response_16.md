The buggy function `_recache` is not properly setting the marker to be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' in the test code. The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class.

The `_recache` function does not check the `fillstyle` attribute to determine if the marker should be filled or not. This causes the failing test to assert that the marker is not filled, even though it should be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should check the `fillstyle` attribute and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. Additionally, the function should handle the different fillstyles to properly determine if the marker should be filled or not.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function checks the `fillstyle` attribute and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This will ensure that the marker is correctly filled or hollow based on the provided `fillstyle`.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass. Any future usage of the `fillstyle` attribute when creating a `MarkerStyle` object should now correctly determine if the marker should be filled or not.
