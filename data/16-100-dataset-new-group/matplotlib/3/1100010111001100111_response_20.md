The issue seems to be related to the markers not appearing hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' using the markers.MarkerStyle. The test_marker_fillstyle test is failing due to this issue.

The buggy function _recache is not correctly handling the case where the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The function is failing to update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter, resulting in the markers not appearing hollow as expected.

To fix this issue, the _recache function needs to be updated to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and set the _filled attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _recache function to consider the fillstyle parameter and set the _filled attribute accordingly, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the test_marker_fillstyle test should pass.
