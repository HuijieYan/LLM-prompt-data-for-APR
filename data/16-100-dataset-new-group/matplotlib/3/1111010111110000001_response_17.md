The issue in the buggy function `_recache` is that it's trying to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This results in the `AssertionError` when the `is_filled` method is called.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._marker_function` exists before attempting to call it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function exists
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the test should pass without any `AssertionError`.
