## Analysis
The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which should return whether or not the marker is filled. The `_recache` function is setting the value of `_filled` to `True`, which contradicts the fillstyle of 'none' set in the failing test.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, specifically with the line `self._filled = True`.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the fillstyle specified in the failing test. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be `False` for the specified fillstyle of 'none'.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the fillstyle provided. This might involve checking the fillstyle and setting `_filled` accordingly within the `_recache` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on the fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By incorporating the condition `self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'` into the `_recache` function, we are now setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified, resolving the bug. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
