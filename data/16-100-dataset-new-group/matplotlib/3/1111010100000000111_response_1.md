## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class, and it seems to be responsible for setting up the attributes of the marker style. The GitHub issue indicates that when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected. This suggests that the `_recache` method is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Potential Error Location
The issue might be in the line `self._filled = True` within the `_recache` method. It seems like this line is hardcoding the `filled` attribute to `True`, which contradicts the intention of setting `fillstyle='none'` in the GitHub issue.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the hardcoded setting of `self._filled = True` within the `_recache` method despite setting `fillstyle='none'`. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when the intention is to make them hollow.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set according to the provided `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Check the fillstyle and set _filled accordingly
        self._marker_function()
    
    # New method to get the fillstyle
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return getattr(self, '_fillstyle', 'full')  # Default to 'full' if fillstyle is not set
```
