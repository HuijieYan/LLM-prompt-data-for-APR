To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value.

We can see from the error message that the failing test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` is evaluating to `assert not True`. This indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The cause of this bug is likely related to the `_recache` method resetting the `_filled` attribute to `True`. To fix this, we need to update the `_recache` method to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter that is passed to the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version sets the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. With this fix, the `is_filled` method should now return the correct value, and the failing test should pass.
