## The cause of the bug
The bug is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False`. This is due to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache` function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` in the `_recache` function.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```
With this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, which should resolve the issue.
