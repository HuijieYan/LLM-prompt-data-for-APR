The issue in the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the case where `self._marker_function` is None. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect variable assignments.

To fix the bug, we can add an if statement to check if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the if statement, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is not None, preventing any unexpected behavior.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
