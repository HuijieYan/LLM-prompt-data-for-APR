The bug in the _recache function is that it sets the _filled attribute to False unconditionally, regardless of the fillstyle provided. This causes the is_filled method to return False when the fillstyle is set to 'none', leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the _recache function to consider the fillstyle when setting the _filled attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _filled attribute conditionally based on the fillstyle, we ensure that the is_filled method will return the correct value based on the fillstyle provided. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
