## Analysis of the buggy function:

This function is expected to reset certain attributes to their default values and then call a `_marker_function`. However, it seems to be missing the definition of `_marker_function`, which could be a potential cause of the bug.

## Potential error locations:
1. The missing definition of `_marker_function` could cause an error.
2. The function does not seem to be resetting the attributes to their default values.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the missing definition of `_marker_function` and the failure to reset the attributes to their default values.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Define a default `_marker_function` that resets the attributes to their default values.
2. Update the `_recache` function to properly reset the attributes and then call the `_marker_function`.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _reset_attributes(self):
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True

def _recache(self):
    self._reset_attributes()
    self._marker_function()

```
