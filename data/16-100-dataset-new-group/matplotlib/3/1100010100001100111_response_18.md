### Bug Explanation
The bug is occurring because the `_recache` function sets the `_filled` property to `True` unconditionally, overriding any changes made when setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`. This causes the markers to remain filled even when the intention is to have hollow markers.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` property when setting the `_filled` property. When `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.fillstyle == 'none':  # Check the fillstyle property
        self._filled = False  # Set _filled to False if fillstyle is 'none'
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will now consider the `fillstyle` property and set the `_filled` property accordingly, ensuring that the markers are displayed as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.
