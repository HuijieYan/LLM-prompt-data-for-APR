The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is attempting to call the `_marker_function` without checking if it is actually defined. This will result in an error if `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to see if `_marker_function` is defined before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():


    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to see if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. This will prevent an error if `_marker_function` is not defined, satisfying the expected input/output values.
