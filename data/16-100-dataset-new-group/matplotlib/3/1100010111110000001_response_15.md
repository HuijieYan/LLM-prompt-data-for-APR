The issue seems to be that the `_recache` function in `markers.py` is not setting the `_filled` attribute correctly, causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` instead of `False` as expected.

To fix this, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test should pass.

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute, the failing test should now pass without any issues.
