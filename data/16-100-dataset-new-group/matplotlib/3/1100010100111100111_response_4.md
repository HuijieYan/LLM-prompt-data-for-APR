The cause of the bug is that the is_filled() method is returning the opposite of the expected value, which is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the is_filled() method to return the correct value as per the fillstyle parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we are setting the _filled variable based on the value of _fillstyle, which will ensure that the is_filled() method returns the correct value.

With this fix, the failing test should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
