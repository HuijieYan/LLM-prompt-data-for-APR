## Analysis
The `_recache` function is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` class. This results in the marker being filled when it should be hollow.

## Error Location
The bug is likely located in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function always setting `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` class. This results in the marker being always filled even when the intention is to have it hollow.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` class. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function as shown, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
