The bug in the _recache() function is that it sets the self._filled attribute to True regardless of the input parameter value for self._fillstyle. This causes the markers to be filled even when the fillstyle is set to 'none', which is contrary to the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to update the _recache() function to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that the markers are hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

Here is the corrected version of the _recache() function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle value
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the markers will behave as expected when the fillstyle is set to 'none', satisfying the requirements described in the GitHub issue.
