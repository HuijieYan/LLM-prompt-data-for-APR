## The analysis of the buggy function

The buggy function is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file. The function is supposed to recache the marker style attributes, but it fails to correctly set the marker to a hollow shape when `fillstyle` is set to `none`. This issue has been reported on GitHub, where a user has provided a code snippet to reproduce the problem.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

The issue is likely related to the way the `_recache` function handles the `fillstyle` parameter. It seems that the function does not correctly update the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter value.

## Explanation of the bug cause

The bug causes the marker to not appear as hollow even when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. As a result, the user's intended usage of creating a hollow marker is not realized. The bug is evident in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` where it checks if the `is_filled()` function returns the correct value.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

The bug can be fixed by updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then the marker should be hollow. Additionally, any other logic related to filling the marker with color needs to be adjusted accordingly.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass.
