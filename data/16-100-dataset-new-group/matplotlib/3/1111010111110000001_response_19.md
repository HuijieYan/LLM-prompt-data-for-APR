The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing the test `test_marker_fillstyle`. The error message shows that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, which means that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the beginning of the `_recache` function, even if the `marker_function` is not `None`. This is causing the `_filled` attribute to be set incorrectly and leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should only be set to `True` if the `marker_function` is not `None`, just like how the other attributes are being conditionally set in the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Set filled only if marker_function is not None
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute will only be set to `True` if the `marker_function` is not `None`, and the failing test should pass.
