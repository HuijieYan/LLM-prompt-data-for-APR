## 1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with corresponding error message, the runtime input/output values, the expected input/output values.
The buggy function `_recache` initializes several attributes of the MarkerStyle class and then calls a method `_marker_function`. The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the MarkerStyle class, which is expected to return True when the marker is filled. However, the failing test is returning False, indicating that the marker is not being filled as expected.

## 2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
The issue may lie in the initialization of the `_filled` attribute and the subsequent call to `_marker_function`.

## 3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the runtime input/output variable values, the expected input/output variable values.
The `_filled` attribute is initialized as `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled, which contradicts the expected behavior. The expected behavior is to have the marker filled, indicated by the `fillstyle='none'` being passed to the MarkerStyle class instance.

## 4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
The bug can be fixed by properly initializing the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided when creating the MarkerStyle instance. Additionally, the `_marker_function` should be checked for any modifications to the `_filled` attribute.

## 5. Provide a corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    fillstyle_map = {
        'full': True,
        'left': True,
        'right': True,
        'bottom': True,
        'top': True,
        'none': False
    }
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = fillstyle_map.get(self._fillstyle, False)
    
    self._marker_function()
```
