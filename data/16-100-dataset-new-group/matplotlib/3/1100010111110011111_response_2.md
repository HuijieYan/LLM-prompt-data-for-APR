## Fixing the bug
The buggy function `_recache` is setting `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts what is expected when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. The correct behavior should be that when `fillstyle` is 'none', `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to check for the `fillstyle` and adjust the `self._filled` value accordingly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function checks the `fillstyle`, and if it's 'none', it sets `self._filled` to `False`, which aligns with the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue of markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none' and also pass the failing test case provided.
