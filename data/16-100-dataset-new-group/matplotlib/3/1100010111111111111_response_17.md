The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the value of `fillstyle`. This causes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail because it expects the marker to be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set `self._filled` based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will now set `self._filled` based on the value of `fillstyle`, which will resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.

This fix also addresses the GitHub issue where the user expects the markers to be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.
