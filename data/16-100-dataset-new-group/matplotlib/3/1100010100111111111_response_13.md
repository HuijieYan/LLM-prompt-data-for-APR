Based on the error message and the provided runtime and expected values, it seems that the issue lies in the `_filled` attribute not being set to `True` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This results in the `MarkerStyle` not being treated as filled, causing the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is also set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional statement to check the `fillstyle` before setting the `_filled` attribute, we ensure that the correct value is assigned based on the provided `fillstyle`.

This corrected version should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It will also address the issue posted on GitHub regarding using `fillstyle='none'` for hollow markers.
