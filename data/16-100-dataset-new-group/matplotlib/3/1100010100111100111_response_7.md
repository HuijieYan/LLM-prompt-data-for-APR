The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly handling the `_filled` attribute when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be returning `False`, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided. We also need to ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the fillstyle.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version will correctly handle the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided, and the `is_filled` method will return the correct value, resolving the issue posted on GitHub as well as passing the failing test.
