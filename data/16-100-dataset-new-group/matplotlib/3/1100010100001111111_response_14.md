The issue seems to be related to the markers not appearing as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This is likely due to the `_filled` attribute not being set to `False` when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute to `False` when `self._fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker should appear as hollow as expected, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
