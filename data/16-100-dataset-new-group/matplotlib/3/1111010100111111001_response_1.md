## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Fixed the condition to check if _marker_function is not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()  # Updated to call _marker_function only when it is not None

```
By fixing the condition to check if `_marker_function` is not None, the function will now correctly assign the default values to the variables and call `_marker_function` only when it is not None. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.
