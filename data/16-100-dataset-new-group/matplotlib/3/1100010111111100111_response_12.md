## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = None  # Set _path to None to reset it
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set _filled to False to make the marker hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

Fixed explanation:

The issue with the original function is that it sets `_filled` to `True` regardless of the value of `fillstyle`. To make the marker hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', we need to set `_filled` to `False`. Additionally, we need to reset the `_path` to `None` to ensure that it is recalculated when the marker is drawn with the new fillstyle.

By making these changes, the corrected function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and also pass the failing test.
