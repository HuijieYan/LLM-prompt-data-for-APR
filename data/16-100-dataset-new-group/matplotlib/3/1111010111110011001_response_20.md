The issue in the buggy function is that it does not properly initialize the `_marker_function` attribute before calling it.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is properly initialized before calling it in the `_recache` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Use inf instead of None for float type
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
