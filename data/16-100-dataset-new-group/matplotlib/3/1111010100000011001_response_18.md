The bug in the _recache function seems to be that it is attempting to call a marker function that does not exist, as the code does not define self._marker_function. 

To fix this bug, we need to either define a marker function for self._marker_function to call, or remove the line that attempts to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding a condition to check if self._marker_function is not None before calling it, we prevent the function from being called if it does not exist. And we also set the snap threshold to float('inf') instead of None to match the expected value.
