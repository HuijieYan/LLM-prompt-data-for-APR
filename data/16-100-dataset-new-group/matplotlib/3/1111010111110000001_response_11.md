The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute, which is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be `False` according to the failing test.

To fix this bug:
1. Change the line `self._filled = True` to `self._filled = False` in the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the failing test should now pass.
