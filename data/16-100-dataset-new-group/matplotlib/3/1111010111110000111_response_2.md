## The analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the class, test code, error message, and GitHub issue

The buggy function `_recache` is within the `MarkerStyle` class. This function is called in the `MarkerStyle` class to update the marker style cache. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with the `fillstyle` parameter set to `'none'` and expects that the marker style is not filled. However, the error message shows that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, indicating that the marker is being filled, which is contrary to expectations. 

The GitHub issue also presents a similar problem where the user is trying to set markers as hollow using a custom `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle` set to `'none'`, but the markers are not displayed as hollow.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The issue seems to stem from the code within the `_recache` function that sets the `filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally. This contradicts the behavior expected when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. 

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `filled` attribute is unconditionally set to `True` within the `_recache` function, which overrides the behavior intended when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by updating the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the `filled` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then the `filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this update, the `filled` attribute is now based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter, and the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
