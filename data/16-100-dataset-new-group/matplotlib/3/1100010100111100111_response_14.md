The buggy function `_recache` appears to be setting the marker style attributes, but there is an issue with the `is_filled` method which is causing the failing test. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the marker is filled or not, and it is failing due to incorrect behavior of the `is_filled` method.

The cause of the bug is that the `is_filled` method is not correctly implemented, causing it to return `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is likely because the `is_filled` method is not checking the `fillstyle` attribute to determine if the marker should be filled or not.

To fix the bug, the `is_filled` method should be modified to check the `fillstyle` attribute and return `False` if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. Additionally, the `_recache` function should ensure that the `fillstyle` attribute is properly set and handled.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle`, and the `is_filled` method should now properly return `True` or `False` based on the `fillstyle`. This should address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
