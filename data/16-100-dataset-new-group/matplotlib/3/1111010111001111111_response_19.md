To fix the bug, we need to change the value of `_filled` to False when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This will ensure that the markers are hollow when `ax.scatter()` is used and `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Change the value of _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the markers should now be hollow when `ax.scatter()` is used and `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This will address the issue reported on GitHub as well.
