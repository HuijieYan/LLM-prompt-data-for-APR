## Corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = None  # Changed from _empty_path
    self._transform = Affine2D()  # Changed from IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = 1.0  # Assign a default value
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

## Explanation

The buggy function `_recache` initializes attributes of the class instance, but it has a few issues:
1. The assignment of `self._path` to `_empty_path` suggests that `_empty_path` is a variable, but it is not defined in the provided code snippet.
2. The assignment of `self._transform` to `IdentityTransform()` suggests that `IdentityTransform` is a class, but it is imported from another module, and it should be referenced as `Affine2D` based on the import statement.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Change `self._path` assignment to `None` as it's not clear from the provided code what `_empty_path` represents.
2. Change `self._transform` assignment to `Affine2D` based on the import statement.

By making these changes, the function will be fixed and should work as intended.
