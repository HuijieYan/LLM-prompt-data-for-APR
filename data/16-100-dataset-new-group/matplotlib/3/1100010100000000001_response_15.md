The buggy function is a part of the matplotlib library. It appears to be a method of a class, as it references `self` and sets several attributes of the class instance.

The potential error in the function is that it is trying to call the `_marker_function` attribute without checking if it actually exists or if it is callable. This could result in an AttributeError or a TypeError if `_marker_function` is not defined or not a callable object.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case where `_marker_function` is not defined or not callable.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to add a check to see if `_marker_function` is defined and callable before attempting to call it. If it is not, the function can gracefully handle this situation, potentially by doing nothing or raising an appropriate error.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # Handle the case where _marker_function is not defined or not callable
        pass  # replace with appropriate error handling or behavior
```
