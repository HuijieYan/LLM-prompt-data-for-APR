The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not properly handling the case when the `_marker_function` is None. This is leading to an undesired execution of `self._marker_function()` when it should be skipped.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if `self._marker_function` is not None before executing it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will only execute `self._marker_function()` if it is not None, preventing the undesired behavior when `self._marker_function` is not properly set.
