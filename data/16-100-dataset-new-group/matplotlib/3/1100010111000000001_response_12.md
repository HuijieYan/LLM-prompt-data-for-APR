## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The _marker_function() is being called without checking if it exists, which could lead to a AttributeError if the function is not defined.

## Cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test:
The failing test is checking the fillstyle of a marker, which triggers the _recache function. The bug occurs because the _recache function is calling self._marker_function() without first checking if it exists, causing an AttributeError.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that self._marker_function is not None before calling it within the _recache function.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function exists
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that self._marker_function is not None before calling it within the _recache function. This prevents the AttributeError from occurring when the function is not defined, fixing the bug.
