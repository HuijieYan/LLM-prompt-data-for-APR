The bug in the given function is that it is not properly setting the filled attribute of the marker. This leads to a failing test for the `is_filled` method of the MarkerStyle object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to the fillstyle of the marker when the `_recache` method is called.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle of the marker, which will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value.

By making this change, the failing test should now pass, and the expected input and output values will be satisfied.
