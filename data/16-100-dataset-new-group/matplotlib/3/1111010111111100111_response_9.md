The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is due to the `_filled` variable being assigned the value of `True` in the `_recache` function, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` variable accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the bug should be resolved and the `is_filled` method should return the correct value.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `MarkerStyle` correctly handles the `fillstyle` parameter.
