## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Change from True to False
    self._marker_function()
```

In the original code, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally, which conflicts with the expected behavior and the reported issue on GitHub. The corrected version sets `_filled` to `False`, which should resolve the issue and match the expected behavior.
