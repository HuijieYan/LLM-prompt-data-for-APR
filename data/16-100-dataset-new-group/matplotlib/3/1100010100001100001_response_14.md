The issue in the buggy function is that it is trying to call a marker function without checking if it exists. This results in an AttributeError when the marker function is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the marker function exists before calling it. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
