The potential error in the buggy function is that it sets `_filled` to `True`, which may be conflicting with the `fillstyle='none'` parameter when creating a MarkerStyle.

The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, and it does not change when setting the fillstyle to 'none' in MarkerStyle, leading to the markers not being hollow as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified in the MarkerStyle.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified in MarkerStyle. This change will ensure that the markers are appropriately filled or hollow based on the fillstyle parameter provided.
