## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# the corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = None  # Set to None to recache the path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Change to False to make markers hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

The issue in the `_recache` function was that the `self._path` was set to `_empty_path` when it should have been set to `None` to recache the path. Additionally, the `self._filled` attribute needed to be set to `False` in order to make the markers hollow.

By making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
