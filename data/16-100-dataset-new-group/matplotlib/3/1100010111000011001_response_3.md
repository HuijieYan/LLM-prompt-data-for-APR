To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the _marker_function attribute exists and is callable before calling it. We also need to update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter passed to the MarkerStyle constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle in ('full', 'left', 'right'):
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

The changes made to the function include checking if _marker_function is not None and callable before calling it. Additionally, we introduced a conditional statement to determine the value of the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter.

With these changes, the function should pass the failing test case.

Let me know if you need anything else.
