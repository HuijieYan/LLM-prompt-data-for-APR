The potential error location within the buggy function is that the `_marker_function` is not being called properly, which affects the `is_filled()` method of `MarkerStyle`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` is not being called, which leads to the `is_filled()` method returning `True` instead of `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is properly called within the `_recache` method, so that the marker's properties are correctly updated.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):  # Check if _marker_function is callable
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        self._filled = False
```

With this corrected version, the `_marker_function` is properly called, ensuring that the marker properties are correctly updated. This should fix the issue with the marker not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.
