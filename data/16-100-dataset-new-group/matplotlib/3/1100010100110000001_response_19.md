## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result, and it seems that the `_filled` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly set in the `_recache` method.

## Potential Error Locations
The `_filled` attribute may not be set correctly in the `_recache` method, leading to the `is_filled` method returning an unexpected result.

## Cause of the Bug
The `_filled` attribute is not being properly set to the expected value in the `_recache` method, leading to the `is_filled` method returning the wrong result.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set to the value of the `fillstyle` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
