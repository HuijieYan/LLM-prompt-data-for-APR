## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
The buggy function `_recache` seems to be setting the internal attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class incorrectly, which is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should not, leading to a failing test.

## Cause of the bug
The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` attribute when setting up the `MarkerStyle` object, which causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and update the internal state of the `MarkerStyle` object accordingly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')  # Update filled property based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` attribute, ensuring that it reflects the correct filled status of the marker style.
