The issue with the buggy function is that it always sets `self._filled` to `True` regardless of the input value of `fillstyle`. This causes the failing test to assert that `not True` which results in the assertion error.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `_fillstyle`, we ensure that it aligns with the input parameter and the failing test. This update should resolve the issue and the failing test should now pass.
