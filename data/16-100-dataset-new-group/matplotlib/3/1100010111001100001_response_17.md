The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly setting the fillstyle of the marker based on the input parameters. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is expecting the marker to have fillstyle 'none' but it is returning as 'filled'. 

The bug is caused because the function is not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter to set the marker as filled or not filled.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to handle the fillstyle parameter and set the marker's filled property accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` property based on the fillstyle parameter, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
