## Analysis:
This buggy function is intended to recache the marker properties. However, the issue is that it's calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it actually exists, which can lead to a `NoneType` object not callable error.

## Potential Error Locations:
The potential error location is at the line `self._marker_function()` where it's being called without checking if it's None.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that it's not checking if `_marker_function` exists before calling it, which can lead to a `NoneType` object not callable error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it in order to avoid the `NoneType` object not callable error.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # Handle the case where _marker_function is None
        pass
```
