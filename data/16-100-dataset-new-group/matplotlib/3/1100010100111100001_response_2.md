The bug in the `_recache` function is caused by the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` variable. It is being set to `True` unconditionally, but should be based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` variable will now be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, ensuring that the function behaves as expected.
