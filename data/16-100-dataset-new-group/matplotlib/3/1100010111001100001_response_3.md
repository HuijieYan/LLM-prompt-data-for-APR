The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is setting `self._filled` to `True` regardless of the input `self._fillstyle` value. This is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail because it expects the marker to not be filled when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that `self._filled` is set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, we ensure that the marker is filled only when `fillstyle` is set to a value other than 'none'. This change should make the failing test pass.
