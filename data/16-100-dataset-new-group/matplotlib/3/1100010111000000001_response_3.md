The potential error in the _recache function is that it is calling self._marker_function without checking if it exists or is callable, which can cause a AttributeError to be raised if self._marker_function is not defined.

The cause of the bug is that the _recache function is assuming that self._marker_function is defined and callable without checking, which can lead to an AttributeError if it's not the case.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if self._marker_function is defined and callable before calling it. If it's not defined or not callable, we can simply return without doing anything.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will now check if self._marker_function is defined and callable before calling it, which should prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
