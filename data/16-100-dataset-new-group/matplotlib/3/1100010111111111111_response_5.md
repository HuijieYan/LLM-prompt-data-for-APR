The buggy function `_recache` is not setting the `_filled` attribute correctly, which leads to the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.

### Cause of the bug
The `_recache` function is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which is conflicting with the expected behavior from the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`. The test is asserting that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False` when `fillstyle='none'`, but the buggy function is setting `_filled` to `True` every time it's called.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` value. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, and if the `fillstyle` is set to anything else, `_filled` should be set to `True`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check for `self._fillstyle`, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` value. This fix should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
