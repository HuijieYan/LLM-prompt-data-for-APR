The buggy function seems to be a method within a class, as indicated by the use of `self`. The function is supposed to recache some attributes, but there are potential issues with the line `self._marker_function()`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` attribute is being called without checking if it is defined. This could lead to a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'something' error if `_marker_function` is not initialized.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
