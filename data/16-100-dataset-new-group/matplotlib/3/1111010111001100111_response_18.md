To fix the bug:
The bug occurs because the `self._filled` attribute is being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which contradicts the intention of setting `fillstyle='none'`. The `_filled` attribute needs to be set to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, it ensures that the marker will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

After making this change, the failing test should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
