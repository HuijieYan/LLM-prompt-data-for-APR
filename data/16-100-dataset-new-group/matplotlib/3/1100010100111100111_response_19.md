The cause of the bug in the _recache function is that the _filled attribute is being set to True regardless of the fillstyle parameter. This is causing the is_filled method to return True, which is incorrect when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the _filled attribute based on the value of the fillstyle parameter. If the fillstyle is 'none', then the _filled attribute should be set to False.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
With this correction, the is_filled method should return the correct value based on the fillstyle parameter, and the failing test should pass. This will also address the issue reported on GitHub where the markers are not hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting fillstyle='none'.
