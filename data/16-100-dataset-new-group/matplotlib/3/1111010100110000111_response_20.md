The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._marker_function()`. It seems like this line is attempting to call a function that is not properly set, causing the error.

The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` attribute is not properly defined, which leads to the `is_filled` method not being properly set. This results in the incorrect assertion failure in the test.

To fix the bug, the `_marker_function` attribute should be properly set to a function that returns the marker's shape and fills.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
        
    # add a method to set the marker function
    def set_marker_function(self, marker_function):
        self._marker_function = marker_function
```

To use the `set_marker_function` method, you would do something like this in your code:

```python
style = markers.MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
style.set_marker_function(your_custom_marker_function)
```

Where `your_custom_marker_function` is the function you define to set the marker's shape and fills based on the marker style.
