The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` in the `_recache` function, which contradicts the expected value of `True`.

To fix the bug, update the `_filled` attribute to `True` in the `_recache` function so that it aligns with the expected value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This correction ensures that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` as expected, fixing the bug and passing the failing test.
