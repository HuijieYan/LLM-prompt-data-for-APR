The bug in the provided function is that it is calling self._marker_function without checking if it exists. This can result in a AttributeError if the function does not exist. 

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that self._marker_function exists before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # handle the case when _marker_function is not defined
        pass
```

This corrected version ensures that the _marker_function is only called if it exists, preventing any AttributeError that may occur due to its absence.
