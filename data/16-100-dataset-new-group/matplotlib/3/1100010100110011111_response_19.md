## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset the marker style settings to default values. However, the failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method returns `True` even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, which is unexpected. This suggests that the `_recache` function is not properly resetting the `self._filled` attribute.

The expected values of the variables right before the return of the buggy function indicate that `self._filled` should be `True` at that point, which is not the expected behavior. This is consistent with the failing test result.

The GitHub issue also confirms the unexpected behavior when trying to set the markers to be hollow using `ax.scatter()` and setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`. This aligns with the failing test and the behavior of the buggy function.

## Bug Cause
The bug likely originates from the `_recache` function not properly resetting the `self._filled` attribute when it should be `False` based on the `fillstyle` setting to `'none'.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `self._filled` attribute is also set to `False`. This adjustment should be made within the `_recache` function to correctly reflect the desired marker style.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_recache` function checks the `fillstyle` setting, and if it is `'none'`, it sets the `self._filled` attribute to `False`. This ensures that the marker is considered hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none', resolving the bug identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
