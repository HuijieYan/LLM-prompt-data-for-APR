The buggy function is failing to correctly update the marker properties, specifically the fill style. The test_marker_fillstyle() function is failing because the marker fillstyle is not being set properly by the _recache() function.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the assignment of self._filled to True at the end of the function. This overrides the marker fillstyle set by the test_marker_fillstyle() function.

The cause of the bug is that the _recache() function is not properly updating the marker properties based on the input parameters.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the fill style is properly updated based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _filled property based on the fill style, we ensure that the marker properties are correctly updated according to the input parameters. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
