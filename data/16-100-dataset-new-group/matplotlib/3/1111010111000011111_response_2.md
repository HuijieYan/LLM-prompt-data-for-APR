## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = None  # Set _path to None to be recalculated later
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Set snap threshold to infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to false for hollow markers
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version of the `_recache` function, the key changes are:
1. Setting `_path` to None to be recalculated later based on the new fillstyle value.
2. Setting `_snap_threshold` to `float('inf')` to ensure it is treated as infinity.
3. Setting `_filled` to `False` to ensure markers are hollow.

These changes address the issue with the marker not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used, as reported in the GitHub issue.
