## Analysis
The issue on GitHub is related to the markers not being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' when using `ax.scatter()`. The provided buggy function `_recache()` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is used to recache the marker. The issue might be occurring due to the incorrect implementation of the `_recache()` function.

### Error Location
The potential error location within the `_recache()` function is the assignment of `self._filled = True`, which should be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is 'none'.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect setting of `self._filled` to `True` in the `_recache()` function, which contradicts the user's intention of having hollow markers when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by updating the `_recache()` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `self._filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the markers are hollow.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Updated line
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` is set to `False` to ensure the markers are hollow. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post.
