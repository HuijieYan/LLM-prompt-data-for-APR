The bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The corrected _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we set `_filled` based on the condition `self._fillstyle != 'none'`. This ensures that the markers will only be filled when `fillstyle` is not set to 'none', which resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
