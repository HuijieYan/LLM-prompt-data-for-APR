The bug in the `_recache` function is likely causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` incorrectly. This is likely because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` within the `_recache` function. This is contradictory to the expected behavior in the failing test, where `fillstyle='none'` should result in `is_filled()` returning `False`.

To fix this bug, we should make sure that the `_filled` attribute is set according to the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
