The bug in the _recache function is that it sets the _filled attribute to True regardless of the fillstyle. This causes the is_filled method to always return True, even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle. If the fillstyle is 'none', then the _filled attribute should be set to False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the is_filled method will return the correct value based on the fillstyle provided, and the failing test should pass. This also resolves the issue reported in GitHub about markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
