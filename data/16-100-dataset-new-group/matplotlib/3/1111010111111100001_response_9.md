The issue in the buggy function is that the `is_filled` method is not correctly implemented, which leads to the failing test. The `is_filled` method is called in the failing test, and it returns the incorrect value `True` instead of `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being properly updated within the `_recache` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated correctly based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none' # update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `is_filled` method should return the correct value, and the failing test should pass.
