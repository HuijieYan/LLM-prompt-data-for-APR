The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` unconditionally before calling the `_marker_function`. This is causing the failing test as it expects the `_filled` attribute to be `True` when the `MarkerStyle` object is initialized with `fillstyle='none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle not in ['none', 'full']:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `filled` attribute will be set correctly based on the value of `fillstyle`, which should resolve the failing test case.
