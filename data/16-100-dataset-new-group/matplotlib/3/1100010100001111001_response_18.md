The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be that the `_filled` variable is being set to `True` regardless of its input value. It should instead be set to the opposite of the value of `self._fillstyle`, which is not being referenced in the original function. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` variable is set to `True` if the value of `self._fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`, and set to `False` if it is equal to `'none'`. This aligns with the expected behavior based on the runtime input/output values.
