The buggy code is in the _recache function, which is meant to update the marker's attributes based on any changes made to them. However, the issue is that the function calls self._marker_function() without checking if it exists, leading to a AttributeError when calling the method is_filled() in the failing test. This is because the _marker_function is None, and the function tries to call it as a method.

To fix this issue, we need to add a conditional check to see if self._marker_function exists before calling it. If it does not exist, we can simply return from the function without doing anything.

Here is the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test_marker_fillstyle() should pass without any errors.
