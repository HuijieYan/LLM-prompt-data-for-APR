The buggy function is a method called _recache, which resets the marker attributes and then calls a marker function. The function fails to update the fillstyle attribute which causes the failing test.

The potential error locations in the _recache function are in the lines where it resets the filled attribute and calls the marker function.

The cause of the bug is that the _recache function does not update the filled attribute based on the fillstyle.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to handle the fillstyle attribute and update the filled attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
In this corrected version, we added a condition to check the fillstyle attribute and update the filled attribute accordingly before calling the marker function. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
