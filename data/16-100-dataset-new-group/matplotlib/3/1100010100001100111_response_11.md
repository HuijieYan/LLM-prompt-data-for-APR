The bug in the _recache function is that it sets self._filled to True regardless of the value of self._fillstyle. This causes the markers to be filled even when the fillstyle is set to 'none', resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to update the _recache function to set self._filled to False when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the _recache function will correctly set self._filled to False, resulting in hollow markers as expected.
