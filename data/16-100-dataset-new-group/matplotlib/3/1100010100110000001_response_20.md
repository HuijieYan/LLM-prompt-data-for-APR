## Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The error message is indicating that the `marker_style.is_filled()` method is returning the incorrect result. This method is related to the `_recache()` function, which is responsible for setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`. However, the bug appears to be causing the `_filled` attribute to not be properly set, leading to the failure of the `is_filled()` method.

## Identifying potential error locations

The `_recache()` function is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`, but the bug may be related to this assignment not being properly executed.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is likely related to the improper handling of the `_filled` attribute within the `_recache()` function.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set to `True` within the `_recache()` function so that the `is_filled()` method returns the expected result.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() is not 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the result of the `get_fillstyle()`, ensuring that it reflects the correct fill style.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the expected result.
