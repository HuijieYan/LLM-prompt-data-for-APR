The issue seems to be related to the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` which checks if the function `is_filled` returns `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. The failing test generates the error message `E       assert not True`, indicating that the `is_filled` function is returning `True` instead of `False` as expected.

Looking at the code of the function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class, it seems that the `is_filled` method is checking the value of the `_filled` attribute, but this attribute is being set to `False` in the `_recache` function. This is contradictory to the test result, where `is_filled` is returning `True`.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` function should set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker is not filled.

Here's a corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By implementing this fix, the `is_filled` method should now correctly return `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none', resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
