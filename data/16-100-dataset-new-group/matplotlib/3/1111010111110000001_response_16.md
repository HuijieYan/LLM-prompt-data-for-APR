The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute as expected, causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should be `False`. This is evident in the failing test function `test_marker_fillstyle` where the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` fails.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set correctly in the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, and the failing test should now pass.
