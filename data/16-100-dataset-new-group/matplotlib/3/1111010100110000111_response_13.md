## Analysis:
The `_recache` function is supposed to reset several attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class, including the `filled` attribute. However, it's not implemented correctly, as it doesn't set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Identification of potential error locations:
The bug seems to be located in the `_recache` function where the `filled` attribute is not getting set correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Cause of the bug:
The `filled` attribute is not being set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. As a result, when the `is_filled` method is called, it returns `True` instead of `False`, causing the failing test case.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The `_recache` function should be modified to set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `filled` should be set to `False`.

## The corrected version:

```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker = marker
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```
In the corrected version, I added the logic to set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `filled` is set to `False`. This ensures that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value.
