The issue in the code seems to be related to the MarkerStyle class not being properly initialized or updated when the _recache function is called. The failing test is specifically checking whether the marker style is filled or not, and it's failing because the is_filled method is returning True when it should not be.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `self._filled = True`. This is setting the marker style to be filled when it should not be, which is leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, the _recache function needs to correctly update the marker style properties based on the fillstyle parameter. This can be done by modifying the _recache function to take into account the fillstyle when setting the filled property.

Here is the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled property based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the MarkerStyle properties will be correctly updated based on the fillstyle, and the failing test should pass.
