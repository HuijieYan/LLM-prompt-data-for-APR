The issue with the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This can lead to an `AttributeError` if `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it. If it doesn't exist, we should simply return from the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version checks if `_marker_function` is None before calling it, preventing the `AttributeError` from occurring. This version of the function should pass the failing test.
