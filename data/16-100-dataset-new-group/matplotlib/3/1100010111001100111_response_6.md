The bug in the `_recache` function is that it always sets the `_filled` attribute to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the `_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that the markers will be correctly filled or hollow based on the `fillstyle` specified.

This correction will address the issue reported on GitHub where setting `fillstyle='none'` did not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`. With this fix, the markers will behave as expected, and the failing test will pass.
