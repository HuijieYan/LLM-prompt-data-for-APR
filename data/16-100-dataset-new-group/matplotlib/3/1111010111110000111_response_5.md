The cause of the bug in the buggy function `_recache` is that it's calling the `_marker_function` without checking if it is `None`. This causes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail with the error message `assert not True`, indicating that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it's not expected to.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If it is `None`, we should return from the function without executing it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
With this correction, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
