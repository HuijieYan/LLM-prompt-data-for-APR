The potential error in the `_recache` function is that `self._marker_function()` is called without first checking whether it exists or is a valid function. This is likely causing the `is_filled()` method to have a wrong output.

To fix this, we should add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` exists and is callable before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will only call `self._marker_function()` if it exists and is callable, which should resolve the issue with the failing test.
