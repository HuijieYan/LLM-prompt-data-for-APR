The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not updating the fillstyle properly when the marker is set to 'none'. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return incorrect results in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we should update the `_recache` function to properly handle the case when the marker style is set to 'none' and ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will properly update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, and the failing test should now pass.
