## Analysis
The issue on GitHub describes a problem where the markers are not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to 'none'. The provided code for reproduction creates a custom marker style with `fillstyle='none'` but does not yield the expected result.

## Error location
The issue seems to be with the implementation of the `_recache` function in `markers.py`. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter, which is resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

## Cause of the bug
The `_recache` function does not take into account the `fillstyle` parameter when creating the marker. This results in the markers always being filled, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter passed to `MarkerStyle`.

## Bug fix strategy
The bug can be fixed by modifying the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter and appropriately set the `self._filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker should be treated as hollow. 

## The corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, `self.get_fillstyle()` is used to determine whether the marker should be filled or not. If the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker is treated as hollow. Otherwise, it is filled as usual. This change will ensure that the marker's fillstyle is correctly respected when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to 'none'.
