The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not correctly handling the case when `self._marker_function` is not None. It should call the `_marker_function` and then perform the other assignments. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._marker_function()
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
```

By moving the call to `_marker_function` within the conditional statement, we ensure that it only gets called when it is not None. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function operates correctly in all cases.
