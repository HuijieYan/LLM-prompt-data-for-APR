The issue seems to be related to the fillstyle not being set correctly in the MarkerStyle class. The failing test function indicates that when creating a MarkerStyle object with `marker='o'` and `fillstyle='none'`, the `is_filled()` method should return `False`, but it does not.

The buggy function `_recache` sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle='none'`. The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect setting of the `_filled` attribute.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be updated to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # ...
    
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
    
    # ...
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class should behave as expected and the failing test should pass. This should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle='none'`.
