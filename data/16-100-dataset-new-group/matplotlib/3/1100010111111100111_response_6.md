### Bug Explanation
The `_recache` function is failing to properly update the `self._filled` variable when the `_marker_function` is called, resulting in the markers not being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is causing the `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail, as it expects the marker to not be filled.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is being correctly updated in the `_recache` function when the `_marker_function` is called.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check on `self._fillstyle` and updating the `_filled` attribute accordingly, we ensure that the markers will appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none',` and filled otherwise. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
