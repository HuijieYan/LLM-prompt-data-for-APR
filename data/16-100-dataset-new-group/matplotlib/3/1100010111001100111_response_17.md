The issue is that when using `markers.MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are not being displayed as hollow when using `ax.scatter()`. This is causing the failing test as well. The problem lies within the `_recache` function which is not handling the `fillstyle='none'` correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function does not account for the `fillstyle` parameter, resulting in markers not being displayed as hollow even when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the marker to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled to False if fillstyle is 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly, we ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the markers will be displayed as hollow.

This fix will address the issue reported in the GitHub and the failing test as well.
