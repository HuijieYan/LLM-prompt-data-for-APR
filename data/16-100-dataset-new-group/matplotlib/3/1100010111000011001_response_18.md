The cause of the bug is that the _marker_function() is being called without checking if it is defined or not. This can lead to a runtime error if the function is not defined.

To fix the bug, we need to check if _marker_function is defined before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will check if _marker_function is defined before calling it, preventing any potential runtime errors.
