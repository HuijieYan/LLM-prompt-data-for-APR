The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle passed to the `MarkerStyle` class.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle is not None and self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

This fix ensures that the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` value, allowing the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly determine whether a marker should be filled or not.

This correction will resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue posted in GitHub where the markers were not hollow when using the `fillstyle` set to 'none'.
