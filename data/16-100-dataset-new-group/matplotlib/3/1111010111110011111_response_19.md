## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the `is_filled()` method not behaving as expected when the `fillstyle` is set to `none`. It appears that the `_recache` method is not properly handling the `fillstyle`. To fix this bug, the `_recache` method needs to be modified to handle the `fillstyle` properly and set the `filled` attribute accordingly.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
        self._marker_function()
```
