The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` is being called without passing any parameters, which may result in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to pass the necessary parameters to the `_marker_function` and set the returned values to the corresponding attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path, self._snap_threshold, self._joinstyle, self._capstyle, self._filled = self._marker_function()
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
```
