The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is failing to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` constructor. This is causing the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the result of calling the `get_fillstyle` method, which correctly determines whether the marker should be filled based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
