## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = self._transform.transform_path_affine(self.get_alt_path())
    self._transform = Affine2D()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = np.inf
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original _recache function was that it didn't correctly handle the fillstyle parameter, resulting in markers not being set to hollow when fillstyle was set to 'none'. To fix this, changes were made to the setting of _filled and _snap_threshold in the _recache function so that it correctly handles the fillstyle.

The corrected version of the _recache function resolves the issue reported in the GitHub issue by ensuring that when fillstyle='none', the markers are hollow when used with ax.scatter() and markers.MarkerStyle.

By setting self._filled = False, the markers will be hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'. Additionally, setting self._snap_threshold = np.inf ensures that the markers are correctly set to hollow.

With these changes, the corrected version of the _recache function ensures that markers are correctly handled when fillstyle is set to 'none', resolving the reported issue.
