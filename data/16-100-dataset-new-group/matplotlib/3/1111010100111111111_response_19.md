### The bug
The bug is in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. When the `is_filled` method is called, it returns `False` even if the fillstyle is set to `'none'`. This is causing the test to fail and also the issue reported on GitHub where the markers are not hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the implementation of the `_recache` method to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` method as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test as well as the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
