### Analysis
The `_recache` function is responsible for reinitializing the marker's properties, including the path, transform, snap_threshold, joinstyle, capstyle, and filled property before invoking the marker function. The failing test case checks whether the fillstyle is set to 'none' and if the marker is filled or not.

### Identified error
The issue seems to be related to the marker's fillstyle not being correctly handled in the `_recache` function. It does not set the `fillstyle` of the marker style.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function does not handle the `fillstyle` property of the marker. In the failing test case, the function should return the fillstyle as `'none'` and the marker should not be filled. However, the current implementation does not consider the `fillstyle`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by adding a line of code in the `_recache` function to set the `fillstyle` of the marker style based on the input `fillstyle`. Additionally, the `is_filled` function should be updated to reflect the correct filled state based on the `fillstyle`.

### Corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = 'full' if self.get_fillstyle() != 'none' else False
    self._marker_function()
```
