The issue with the buggy function `_recache` is that it is not correctly setting the fillstyle and is always setting the `_filled` variable to True, regardless of the specified fillstyle.

The bug is caused by the line `self._filled = True` which is overriding the fillstyle specified by the input parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly set the `self._filled` variable based on the specified fillstyle.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` variable will be set based on the specified fillstyle, resolving the bug.
