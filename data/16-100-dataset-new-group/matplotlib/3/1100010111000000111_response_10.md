## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # updated to set the marker as hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
In the original buggy function, the `_filled` attribute is hardcoded to `True`, which causes the markers to always be filled. This leads to the issue reported on GitHub where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not produce hollow markers as expected.

To fix this bug, I have suggested updating the `_filled` attribute to `False` in the `_recache` function so that the markers are set as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

With this correction, the markers should behave as expected and the failing test case should pass.
