The issue with the buggy function `_recache` is that it is trying to call a function `self._marker_function` without checking if it is defined. This can lead to an AttributeError if the `_marker_function` is not set.

To fix the bug, you can add a check to see if `_marker_function` is defined before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_marker_function` is now only called if it is not `None`, preventing the AttributeError that was present in the original buggy function.
