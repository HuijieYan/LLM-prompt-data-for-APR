## Fixing the bug

The bug seems to be related to the `is_filled` method not returning the correct value when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle`.

### Potential error locations:
- The `is_filled` method might not be checking the `fillstyle` parameter correctly.
- The `_recache` method might not be updating the `is_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `is_filled` method is not returning the correct value when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none',` which is leading to the failing test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_filled` method to correctly check the `fillstyle` parameter and update it during the `_recache` method.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `is_filled` method should return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test should pass. Additionally, the GitHub issue related to markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none' should also be resolved.
