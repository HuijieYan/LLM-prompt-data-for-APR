## Correction of the buggy function

The issue seems to be related to the `fillstyle` parameter not functioning as expected when creating scatter plots using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'`. The function `_recache` is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter, which is causing the markers to not appear as hollow as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_recache` does not consider the `fillstyle` parameter and does not update the `self._filled` variable based on the `fillstyle`.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to check the value of the `fillstyle` attribute and update the `_filled` variable accordingly.

The corrected version of the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` attribute, the corrected function will now correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing markers to appear as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` passes as expected.
