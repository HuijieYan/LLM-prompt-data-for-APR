## Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to recalculate certain attributes when the marker style changes. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result, which leads to the markers not being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue could be related to the way the `_filled` attribute is being set or how the `_marker_function` is being called.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is being caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` setting. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', resulting in filled markers instead of hollow ones.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `_recache` function should be updated to take into account the `fillstyle` setting and properly update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. Additionally, calling the `_marker_function` should be reviewed to ensure it updates the marker style as expected.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` setting, and the `_marker_function` is called to update the marker style.

With this correction, the `is_filled` method should return the correct result based on the `fillstyle`, and the markers should appear as expected when using the `fillstyle='none'` setting.
