## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to correctly handle the case when the `marker_function` is `None`. This may be causing the `is_filled` method to return a wrong value, as seen in the failing test.

## Potential Error Location
The main potential error location is within the if condition `if self._marker_function is None`, and the subsequent call to `self._marker_function()`.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that when the `marker_function` is `None`, the function should skip the call to `self._marker_function()`. However, as it currently stands, it is still calling `self._marker_function()`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the condition `if self._marker_function is None` is appropriately handled to avoid the call to `self._marker_function()` in case it's None. This could involve adding a check before calling the function.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Add a check to only call _marker_function when it's not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version adds a check to only call `_marker_function` when it's not None, resolving the issue and ensuring that the function behaves as expected.
