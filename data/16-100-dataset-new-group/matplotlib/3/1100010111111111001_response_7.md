The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `False` unconditionally, which is incorrect. The expected behavior is that the `fillstyle` attribute should determine the value of `_filled`. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be `False`, otherwise it should be `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be dynamically set based on the `fillstyle` attribute, and the failing test should pass.
