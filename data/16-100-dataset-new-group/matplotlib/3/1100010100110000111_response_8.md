## Analysis
The buggy function is `_recache` and it is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the given marker style, which is causing the test to fail.

The GitHub issue also confirms the problem where setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' does not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`. This suggests that the bug is related to the `fillstyle` parameter not being properly handled in the `MarkerStyle` class.

## Potential Error Location
The cause of the bug likely stems from the way the `fillstyle` parameter is being processed within the `_recache` function. It seems that the `fillstyle` setting is not being properly applied, resulting in the markers not being hollow when expected.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', it does not properly override the default setting for filling the markers. This results in the markers being filled when they are expected to be hollow.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to handle the `fillstyle` parameter properly. When `fillstyle` is set to 'none', it should ensure that the markers are indeed hollow. This may require updating the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly interpret the `fillstyle` setting and reflect that in the rendering of markers.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# the corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled property based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_recache` function now properly updates the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` setting. This ensures that when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers are rendered as hollow as expected.
