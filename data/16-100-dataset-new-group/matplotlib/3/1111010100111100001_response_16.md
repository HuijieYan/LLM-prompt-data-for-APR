The issue in the `_recache` method is that it is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle. The `_marker_function` should be responsible for updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, but it is not doing so correctly.

We can fix the bug by updating the `_recache` method to handle the fillstyle and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional statement to check the fillstyle and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute correctly reflects the fillstyle, and the failing test should pass with this corrected version.
