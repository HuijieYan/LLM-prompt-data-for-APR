## The potential error location within the buggy function
The bug may be located in the `_recache` function where it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally. This may prevent the marker from being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `none`.

## The cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function unconditionally setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which prevents the marker from being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `none`. This results in the failing test and the markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()`.

## A strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `none`, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` to allow the marker to be hollow.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check if fillstyle is set to none, then set _filled to False
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version of the `_recache` function checks the `fillstyle` and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then `_filled` is set to `False` to allow the marker to be hollow. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
