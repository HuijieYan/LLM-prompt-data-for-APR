The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not setting the filled property based on the fillstyle. This is why the `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` is failing in the test.

To fix this, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the filled property based on the fillstyle provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` property based on the provided fillstyle, we ensure that the `is_filled` method of MarkerStyle reflects the correct value, and the failing test should pass with this corrected version.
