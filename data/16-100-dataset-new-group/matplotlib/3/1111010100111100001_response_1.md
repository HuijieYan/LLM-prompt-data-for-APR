The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be related to the `is_filled` method. The `is_filled` method is expected to return `True` when the marker style is filled and `False` when it is not. However, the buggy function is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the fill style, which causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check for fill styles other than 'filled' or 'none'
    if self._fillstyle in ['left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top', 'center']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding a conditional statement to check the fill style and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly, we can ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the fill style provided.
