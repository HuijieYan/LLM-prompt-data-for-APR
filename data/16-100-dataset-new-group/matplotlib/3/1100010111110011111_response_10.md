## Correction

The issue with the `_recache` function is that it is not initializing the `marker_function` properly. The `_marker_function` should be initialized to the `_TransformedPath` when no custom function is set. To fix this issue, we need to add a check to the `_recache` function to initialize the `_marker_function` to the `_TransformedPath` if it is None.

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        self._marker_function = _TransformedPath()
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will now properly initialize the `_marker_function` to the `_TransformedPath` if it is None, which should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
