The bug in the given function is that it is not setting the filled attribute correctly, which is causing the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the _recache function is not correctly setting the filled attribute to True, which is causing the is_filled() method to return False when it should return True.

To fix the bug, the _recache function should explicitly set the filled attribute to True before calling the _marker_function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

This change will ensure that the filled attribute is correctly set to True before calling the _marker_function, which should resolve the failing test case.
