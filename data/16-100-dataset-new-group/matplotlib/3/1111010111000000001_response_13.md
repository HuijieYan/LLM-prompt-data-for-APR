The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing the test `test_marker_fillstyle` because it is not properly setting the fillstyle. The `MarkerStyle` class is part of the `matplotlib` library and is responsible for defining the properties and behavior of markers used in plots.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not setting the fillstyle properly when the `MarkerStyle` object is created with a specific `fillstyle` parameter.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_recache` function to handle the `fillstyle` parameter correctly and ensure that the `MarkerStyle` object's fillstyle is properly set when it is created.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that the fillstyle is properly reflected in the `_recache` function.

This corrected version of the `_recache` function should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
