The bug in the function `_recache` is causing the `MarkerStyle` object to return an incorrect value for the `is_filled` method, leading to a failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, irrespective of the value of `fillstyle` passed to the `MarkerStyle` object. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `False` even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to take into account the value of `fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `MarkerStyle` object will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`, and the failing test should pass.
