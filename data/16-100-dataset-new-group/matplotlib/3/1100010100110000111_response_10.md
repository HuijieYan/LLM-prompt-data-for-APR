## Analysis
The `_recache` function is called when the marker style is updated, but it does not correctly handle the case when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This results in the marker not being hollow as expected.

## Identifying the potential error location
The potential error is where the marker function is called after setting the marker attributes.

## Cause of the bug
The `_recache` function does not correctly handle the case when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', resulting in the marker not being hollow as expected.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly handle the case when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This may involve checking the `fillstyle` attribute before setting the other marker attributes.

## The corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```
