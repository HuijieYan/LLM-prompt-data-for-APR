## Analysis
The failing test is checking if the marker style is filled or not, and it's failing because the `is_filled` method is not implemented correctly. The `is_filled` method should return `True` if the marker is filled, and `False` if it is not filled. This bug is causing the markers to be filled when they should not be, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Bug location
The bug is located in the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class.

## Cause of the bug
The `is_filled` method is supposed to check if the marker is filled or not, and the bug is causing it to always return `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly check the `fillstyle` parameter and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

class MarkerStyle:
    def __init__(self, marker='', fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker_function = None
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle

    def _set_marker(self, marker):
        self._marker_function = None
        self._recache()

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self.fillstyle

    def is_filled(self):
        return self.fillstyle != 'none'

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()

```
