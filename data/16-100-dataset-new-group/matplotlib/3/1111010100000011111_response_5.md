To fix the bug in the _recache function within the MarkerStyle class, we need to ensure that the marker function is properly called and that the _filled attribute is set to False when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The cause of the bug is that the _marker_function is not being properly called when the fillstyle is set to 'none', leading to the markers not being hollow as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to check the fillstyle and set the _filled attribute accordingly. Additionally, we need to properly call the _marker_function when it is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = None
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = np.inf
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function now properly sets the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle and calls the _marker_function when it is not None. This should address the issue reported on GitHub, and the markers should now appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
