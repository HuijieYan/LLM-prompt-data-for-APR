The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to set the marker as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified. This is evident from the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` where the marker's `fillstyle` is set to `none`, but the function fails to return the correct fillstyle. This bug has also been reported in a GitHub issue where the user is not able to create hollow markers using `markers.MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the marker as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we check if the fillstyle is set to 'none' and accordingly set the `_filled` attribute to `False` to create a hollow marker.

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and set the marker as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified. This will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and the failing test will pass.
