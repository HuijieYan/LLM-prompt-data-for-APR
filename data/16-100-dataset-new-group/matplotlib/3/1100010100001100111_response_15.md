The buggy function is supposed to recache the marker style, but it seems to be setting some properties to default values before calling the marker function. The issue described on GitHub is related to using markers with a fillstyle of 'none', but not getting the expected hollow markers.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
self._filled = True
```

The cause of the bug is that the function is setting the `_filled` property to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the markers to not appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` property is set according to the value of the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False` to make the markers hollow.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # set filled property based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```
By setting the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` value, the corrected function should now display the markers as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
