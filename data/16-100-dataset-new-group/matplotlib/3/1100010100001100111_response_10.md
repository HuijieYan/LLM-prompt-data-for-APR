The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for ensuring the markers are re-cached when any of the marker properties change. However, the bug causes the markers to not be hollow when `ax.scatter()` is used and the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

The issue is caused by the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` property in the `_recache` function. The function sets the `_filled` attribute to True unconditionally, which results in the marker being filled regardless of the specified `fillstyle`.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of the `fillstyle` property. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to False.

Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` property, ensuring that the markers are hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'. This addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
