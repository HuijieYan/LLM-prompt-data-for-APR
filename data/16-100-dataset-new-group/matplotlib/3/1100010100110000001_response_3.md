The error message indicates that the is_filled() method of MarkerStyle is returning the wrong value. This method is intended to check if the marker is filled, which is contradictory to the assertion error. 

The cause of the bug is that the _recache function is setting the _filled attribute to True regardless if the marker is intended to be filled or not. This is contradicting the actual fillstyle of the marker.

To fix the bug, the _recache function should take into account the fillstyle of the marker and set the _filled attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
