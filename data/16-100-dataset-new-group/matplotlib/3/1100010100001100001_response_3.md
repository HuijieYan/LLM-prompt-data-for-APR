The buggy function seems to be setting some internal variables based on certain conditions, and then calling a `_marker_function` which is not provided in the code snippet.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the assignments of `self._path`, `self._snap_threshold`, `self._joinstyle`, `self._capstyle`, and `self._filled` variables. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is setting `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the information provided in the input parameters and the operation of the rest of the function.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to conditionally set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle` input parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle not in ['none', 'None']
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` variable will be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, which should resolve the bug.
