## Explanation
The buggy function `_recache` is not handling the case where `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` correctly, causing the markers to be filled when it should be hollow. This is consistent with the GitHub issue where the user is setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'` but it's not having the desired effect.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the case where `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. We should ensure that the marker is drawn as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, I added a condition to check if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. If it is, then `_filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be drawn as hollow. Otherwise, `_filled` is set to `True` to indicate that the marker should be filled. This change should address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
