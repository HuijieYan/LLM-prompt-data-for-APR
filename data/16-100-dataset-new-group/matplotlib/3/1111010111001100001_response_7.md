The buggy function `_recache` is not properly handling the `fillstyle` attribute. In the failing test, the marker style is set to `'none'` for the `fillstyle` and the function is expected to return that value when `get_fillstyle` is called.

The issue arises from the fact that the `_recache` function is not updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute. The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, and it should be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the `fillstyle` attribute, and the failing test will pass.
