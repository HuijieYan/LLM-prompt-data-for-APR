The bug in the provided function is that it tries to call a marker function without checking if it actually exists, which could lead to a potential Attribute Error. 

To fix this bug, we should add a check to see if the marker function exists before trying to call it. If it does not exist, we should return early from the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the marker function exists and return if it does not. If it exists, it will proceed with the other operations as before.
