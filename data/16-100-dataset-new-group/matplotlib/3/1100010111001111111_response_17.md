The bug in the function `_recache` is that it is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the value of `fillstyle` and it should be set based on the value of `fillstyle`.

To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the function will set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`, allowing the `MarkerStyle` to behave as expected in the failing test. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not appearing as hollow when the `fillstyle` was set to `'none'`.
