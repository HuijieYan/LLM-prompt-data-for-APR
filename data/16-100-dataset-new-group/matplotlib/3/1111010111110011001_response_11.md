To fix the buggy function, we need to address the fact that the `_marker_function` is not being set correctly and hence not returning the expected value for `is_filled()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = Path(array([[ 0.        , -1.        ] ... [ 1,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,
    4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4, 79], dtype=uint8))
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = inf
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Change the default filled value to False

    self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function

    if self._filled is None:  # If filled has not been set by the marker function
        self._filled = True  # Set filled to True by default

    return
```

By making sure that the default value for `_filled` is set to `False` before calling the `_marker_function` and then updating it if necessary after the call, we can ensure the correct behavior of the function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected output values.
