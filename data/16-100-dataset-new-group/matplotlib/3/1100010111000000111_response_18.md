## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = markers._empty_path
    self._transform = markers.IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self.get_fillstyle() != 'none')  # Setting _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

## Explanation of the bug fix
The bug was that the `_recache` function was not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. The corrected version of the function now checks the `fillstyle` and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This fix ensures that when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers will be hollow as expected when used with `ax.scatter()`.

By adding the line `self._filled = (self.get_fillstyle() != 'none')`, we are now correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, which resolves the issue of markers not being hollow as expected.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
