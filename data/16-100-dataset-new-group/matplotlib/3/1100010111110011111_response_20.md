The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly setting the properties for the `MarkerStyle` object, resulting in the failing test and GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not setting the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when it should be `False` based on the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle` constructor.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to take into account the `fillstyle` and set the `_filled` property accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self.get_fillstyle() != 'none' else False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` property will be set based on the `fillstyle` provided to the `MarkerStyle` object. This will resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
