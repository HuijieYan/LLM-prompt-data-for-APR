## Analysis
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the markers are not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'`. The provided code for reproduction sets the marker style to `'none'` to achieve hollow markers, but it does not work as expected.

## Error Locations
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is responsible for caching marker properties, including the fill style. The issue may be related to how the `_recache` function handles the marker function when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not handling the `fillstyle` correctly when the custom marker style is used. This leads to the markers not being displayed as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug and ensure that markers are hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none', the `_recache` function should be updated to handle the custom marker style and its `fillstyle` property correctly. This may involve checking the `fillstyle` property and custom code execution based on the fill style specified in the marker style.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_recache` function now checks the fill style of the marker and sets the `_filled` property accordingly. If the fill style is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` property is set to `False`, ensuring that the markers are displayed as hollow. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that custom markers with `'none'` fill style are displayed correctly.
