## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` of the `MarkerStyle` class is expected to recalculate attributes such as `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, etc. based on the current settings and the `_marker_function`. However, there is no definition or assignment of `_marker_function` within the `MarkerStyle` class, which causes an AttributeError when the function is called.

## Identified Error Location:
The error occurs when the `_recache` function tries to invoke the undefined `_marker_function`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that `_marker_function` is not defined or assigned in the `MarkerStyle` class, and the function `_recache` is trying to call it without checking for its existence.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define and assign a valid function to `_marker_function` within the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. Check whether `_marker_function` is not None before trying to call it in the `_recache` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the corrected class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # Define and assign a valid function to _marker_function
    def _marker_function(self):
        # Add code to define the behavior of the marker function
        pass

    # the fixed version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
