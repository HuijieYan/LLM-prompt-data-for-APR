The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This results in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` when it calls `marker_style.is_filled()` because during the initialization of `marker_style`, `self._marker_function` is not set and it calls a function that does not exist.

To fix the bug, you need to add a check for the existence of `self._marker_function` before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Add a check for the existence of self._marker_function
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass.
