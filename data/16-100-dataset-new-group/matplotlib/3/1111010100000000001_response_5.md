The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class appears to be incomplete and contains potential errors. Here's a step-by-step analysis and suggested fix:

1. Analysis:
   - The `_recache` function is intended to recalculate the marker style attributes based on the current state. However, it seems to be missing the implementation details for `_marker_function`.
   
2. Potential Error Locations:
   - The line `if self._marker_function is None:` should likely be checking `if self._marker_function() is None:` to call the function and check its return value.
   - The function `_marker_function` is not defined within the provided code, so its implementation needs to be considered or handled differently.

3. Cause of the Bug:
   - The current implementation doesn't handle the `_marker_function` properly and is lacking the logic to recalculate the marker attributes.

4. Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
   - Define the `_marker_function` or handle its absence in a different way.
   - Ensure that the function checks the return value of `_marker_function` and not just its existence.
   - Implement the necessary logic to recalculate the marker attributes based on the current state.

5. Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function to recalculate attributes
```
In this corrected version, the if condition checks for the existence of `_marker_function` and calls it to recalculate the marker attributes as intended.
