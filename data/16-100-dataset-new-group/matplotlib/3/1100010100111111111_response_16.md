## Correction
After analyzing the bug, it seems that the `is_filled` method is not correctly updating the `self._filled` attribute. This causes the failing test to return `False` when it should be returning `True` based on the input parameters.

The issue reported on GitHub also confirms that the `fillstyle='none'` is not correctly making the markers hollow.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute should be updated to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the marker will be hollow, and the failing test should pass.
