## The analysis of the buggy function, failing test, error message, and GitHub issue

The buggy function is the `_recache` method within the `MarkerStyle` class. It is failing to correctly set the fillstyle to 'none' when creating a marker with the specified style. This is evident from the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, where it checks if the marker style is filled or not.

The error message indicates that the `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` failed, meaning that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` after setting the fillstyle to 'none'.

The GitHub issue further confirms this problem, as the user is experiencing the same issue when trying to create a custom marker with hollow fillstyle using `ax.scatter()` and `markers.MarkerStyle()`.

## Identification of potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error location within the `_recache` method is in the line `self._filled = True`, where it sets the marker as filled regardless of the fillstyle specified.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug

The `self._filled = True` statement in the `_recache` method is overriding the fillstyle setting and marking the marker as filled, causing the `is_filled` method to incorrectly return `True`.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_recache` method to properly set the filled property based on the fillstyle specified. If the fillstyle is 'none', then the marker should be marked as not filled.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` method to set the `_filled` property based on the fillstyle, the corrected version of the code ensures that the marker is correctly marked as filled or hollow based on the specified fillstyle. This modification addresses the bug and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
