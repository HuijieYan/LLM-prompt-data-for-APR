The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recalculate the marker style attributes based on the current state. However, it seems to be incorrectly setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the input `fillstyle`.

The potential error location is the line `self._filled = True`. This line should be updated based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the failing test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` input parameter. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` input parameter, and the failing test should now pass.
