## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

The bug in the original function is that it checks if `self._marker_function` is `None` before executing the code, which is not consistent with the expected behavior. The test is expecting the code inside the function to always execute.

In the corrected version, we changed the condition to `if self._marker_function is not None`, which ensures that the code inside the function will always execute if `self._marker_function` is not `None`.

With this change, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
