Based on the error message, failing test, and the GitHub issue, it seems that the `MarkerStyle` is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter when set to 'none'. This can be attributed to the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.

The `MarkerStyle` class uses the `_recache` method to update certain properties based on marker changes. However, the current implementation of `_recache` does not correctly handle the fillstyle parameter, resulting in the marker not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` method should be updated to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. Additionally, it may also be necessary to update the logic in the `MarkerStyle` class to ensure that the `is_filled()` method correctly reflects the fillstyle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled property based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class should now correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and the `is_filled()` method should reflect the fillstyle as expected, resolving the issue and allowing the failing test to pass.
