Based on the error message, it seems that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is not returning the expected value. This method is being called after the `_recache` function is executed, and it seems that the `_recache` function is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is hardcoded to `True` within the `_recache` function, which does not allow for it to change based on the parameters passed to the `MarkerStyle` object.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `_recache` function to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the input parameters passed to the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle is not None and self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version includes setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` parameter of the `MarkerStyle` object. With this change, the function should now properly set the `_filled` attribute, allowing the `is_filled` method to return the expected value.
