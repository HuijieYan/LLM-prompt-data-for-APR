The issue seems to be related to setting the fillstyle to 'none' when using markers.MarkerStyle, but still not getting hollow markers as expected.

After analyzing the code and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the _filled attribute in the _recache function. The _filled attribute is set to True unconditionally, which causes the markers to be filled regardless of the fillstyle parameter.

To fix this bug, the _filled attribute should be set based on the value of the fillstyle parameter. If the fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False to create hollow markers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter, the markers will now be correctly rendered as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' as described in the GitHub issue.
