The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists or not. This is causing an error when the `marker_function` does not exist, as shown in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to see if `self._marker_function` exists before calling it. If it does not exist, we can simply return from the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
