The bug in the `_recache` function is that it does not properly handle the case when `self._marker_function` is `None`. This results in an AttributeError when it is called.

To fix this bug, we should add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, preventing the AttributeError.
