The buggy function seems to be trying to set default values for various attributes of the MarkerStyle class, and then execute the _marker_function if it is not None. However, it is not updating the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter.

The cause of the bug is that when the fillstyle parameter is set to 'none', the _filled attribute should be set to False, but the buggy function is not updating this attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _filled attribute will be updated based on the fillstyle parameter, and the failing test should pass.
