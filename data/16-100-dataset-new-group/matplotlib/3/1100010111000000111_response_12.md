## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._alt_path = self._path
    self._alt_transform = self._transform
    self._path = None
    self._transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Change to make the marker hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original `_recache` function is related to setting the marker as filled. The `self._filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, which causes the marker to be filled even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. The corrected version addresses this by explicitly setting the `_filled` attribute to `False`, ensuring that the marker will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

Additionally, the `self._alt_path` and `self._alt_transform` attributes are used to store the original path and transform in case they are needed later, and the `_path` and `_transform` attributes are set to `None` initially to avoid any conflicts.

With these changes, the `test_marker_fillstyle` test function should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
