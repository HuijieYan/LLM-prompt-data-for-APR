The bug seems to be related to the MarkerStyle class and the way the _recache function sets the _filled attribute. The failing test is checking if the marker is not filled, but it fails because the is_filled method is returning True instead of False.

The _recache function initializes the _filled attribute to True, and this value is never changed. This causes the is_filled method to always return True.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to properly set the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter passed to the MarkerStyle constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This correction ensures that the _filled attribute is set based on the fillstyle parameter, and the failing test should now pass.
