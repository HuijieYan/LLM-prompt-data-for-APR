To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class. The current implementation does not properly handle the `filled` attribute, which leads to the failing test. 
Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

The bug was caused by not updating the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` when `_recache` is called. As a result, the `is_filled` method returns an incorrect value, leading to the failing test.

By updating the `filled` attribute with `self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'`, we ensure that it reflects the correct state based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

This corrected version should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It addresses the issue posted on GitHub where the markers were not appearing as hollow when the fillstyle was set to 'none'.
