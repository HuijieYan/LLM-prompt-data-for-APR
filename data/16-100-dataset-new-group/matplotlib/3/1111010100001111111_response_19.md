To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to update the `_filled` property based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to make the marker hollow.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled property based on _fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` property based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, we ensure that the marker will be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, as expected.

This fix will resolve the issue posted on GitHub where the markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none'. This fix also aligns with the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
