The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the marker to not be rendered as hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to "none". The buggy function is not correctly handling the case when `fillstyle` is set to "none". This is evident from the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`. The GitHub issue also confirms that the behavior is unexpected when trying to set the marker as hollow.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when the `fillstyle` is set to "none".

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

By explicitly checking the `fillstyle` and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the corrected function ensures that the marker is rendered as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to "none".

With this correction, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass, and the issue described in the GitHub post should be resolved.
