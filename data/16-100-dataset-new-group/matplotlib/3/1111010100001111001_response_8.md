The bug in the function is causing the `_filled` variable to be set to `False` instead of the expected value `True`. This is likely due to an incorrect assignment or an issue with the `_marker_function()` call.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `_filled` variable is set to `True` as expected. This can be done by checking the logic within the `_marker_function()` that affects the `_filled` variable and making any necessary corrections.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Corrected assignment
        self._marker_function()
```
With this correction, the function should now correctly set the `_filled` variable to `True` as expected.
