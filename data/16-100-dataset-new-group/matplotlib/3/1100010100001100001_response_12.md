The issue with the given buggy function is that it is returning without actually calling the `_marker_function`, which seems to be an essential part of the function's intended behavior.

Based on the provided runtime values and types, we can see that the `_filled` variable is set to `False` at the end of the function, which indicates that the function is not behaving as expected. 

To fix this bug, we should call the `_marker_function` at the end of the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it at the end of the function. This will ensure that the intended behavior of the function is achieved.
