## The cause of the bug
The function `_recache` is supposed to set the internal attributes of a `MarkerStyle` object, including the `_filled` attribute. However, the function is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`, resulting in the failing test.

## The solution
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` when the `_recache` function is called.

## The source code of the corrected function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Setting the _filled attribute to True
    self._marker_function()
```
