## Analysis
The buggy function is `_recache` which is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The error message indicates that the method `is_filled` is not returning the expected value, leading to an assertion error.

The `_recache` function does not set the `self._filled` attribute to the correct value and may not be calling the `_marker_function` correctly. This could be causing the `is_filled` method to return the wrong value.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_recache` method not correctly setting the `self._filled` attribute, which leads to the `is_filled` method returning the wrong value.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` method correctly sets the `self._filled` attribute based on the marker style and that the `_marker_function` is called correctly.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self._fillstyle not in ['none', 'left', 'right']
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version of the `_recache` method, we check if the `_marker_function` is not None before proceeding. We then set the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` attribute. This change ensures that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value.
