## Analysis
The issue seems to be related to the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` after setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue might be within the implementation of the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.

## Cause of the Bug
It seems that the `is_filled()` method is not correctly handling the case when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', causing it to incorrectly return `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `is_filled()` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. It should return `False` in this scenario.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Corrected line
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the issue described in the GitHub issue should be resolved. The `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class should now return the correct value when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
