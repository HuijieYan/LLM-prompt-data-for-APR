The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to perform some initializations before calling the `_marker_function`. However, the problem lies in the fact that it is not updating the attributes properly before calling the `_marker_function`. 

The failing test is for the `is_filled` method, which checks if the marker is filled or not. The failing assertion indicates that the method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, meaning that the marker is incorrectly being considered as filled.

The cause of this bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, and it is not being updated based on the input parameters when the `MarkerStyle` instance is created.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the input parameters when the `MarkerStyle` instance is created.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
``` 

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the fillstyle, and the failing test should pass.
