## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result. This method is related to the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class.

## Error location
There are no conditional checks within the `_recache` function. It always sets `self._filled` to True, which causes the `is_filled` method to return True even when it should not.

## Cause of the bug
The `_recache` function does not check for the fillstyle of the marker, which is causing the `_filled` attribute to always be set to True.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to modify the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute. If the fillstyle is set to 'none', then `_filled` should be set to False.

## The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```
With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will now be set based on the `fillstyle` of the marker, ensuring that the `is_filled` method returns the expected result.
