Based on the information provided, we can see that the issue arises from the MarkerStyle class not properly handling the 'fillstyle' parameter when set to 'none'. The _recache function should be responsible for updating the MarkerStyle attributes based on the input parameters, but it seems to be ignoring the fillstyle parameter when it should be considering it and setting the filled attribute accordingly.

To address the bug, we should modify the _recache function to check the fillstyle parameter and set the filled attribute based on its value. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the MarkerStyle class will now properly handle the fillstyle parameter and set the filled attribute accordingly. This should address the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
