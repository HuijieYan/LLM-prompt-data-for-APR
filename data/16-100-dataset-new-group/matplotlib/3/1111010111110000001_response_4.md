The `MarkerStyle` class has a method `_recache` that is called when the marker needs to be updated. The method initializes certain attributes of the class and then calls `_marker_function()`. The issue here is that the `_marker_function` is not being assigned properly, and as a result, it is not being called when the method is invoked.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tries to create a `MarkerStyle` object with a certain fill style and then checks whether it is filled or not. The failing test asserts that the marker style is not filled, but the assertion fails because the `is_filled` method is not being called due to the bug.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `_marker_function` is not assigned, and therefore it does not get called when the `_recache` method is invoked.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is assigned correctly, and it is a valid callable function. If the `_marker_function` is intended to be a part of the `MarkerStyle` class, it should be defined within the class.

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker_function=None):
        self._marker_function = marker_function

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `MarkerStyle` class now accepts a `marker_function` as an argument in its constructor. This function is then assigned to the `_marker_function` attribute. When the `_recache` method is called, it checks if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

By doing so, the `_marker_function` will be properly assigned and called when the `_recache` method is invoked, fixing the bug and allowing the `test_marker_fillstyle` test to pass.
