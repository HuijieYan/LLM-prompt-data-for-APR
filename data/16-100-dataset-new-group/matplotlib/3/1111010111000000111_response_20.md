## The analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the test code and the GitHub issue
The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file, and it is responsible for recaching the marker style. The failing test named test_marker_fillstyle is testing the functionality of setting the fillstyle to 'none' and checking if the marker is hollow, but it is failing. The GitHub issue also reports the same problem, where setting fillstyle to 'none' does not make the markers hollow when using ax.scatter().

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The _recache function is setting the _filled attribute to True by default, which might be causing the markers to always be filled regardless of the fillstyle parameter set by the user.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the _recache function not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter when recaching the marker style. It is setting _filled to True regardless of the fillstyle specified by the user, resulting in filled markers instead of hollow ones.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the _recache function to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter. When fillstyle is set to 'none', the _filled attribute should be set to False to make the markers hollow.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
  
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _filled attribute of the MarkerStyle class will be updated based on the fillstyle specified by the user, allowing the markers to be hollow when fillstyle is 'none'. This should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
