The buggy function is causing an assertion error when the test_marker_fillstyle() test is run. The error indicates that the is_filled() method is not returning the expected value.

The bug in the function is that it is calling self._marker_function() without any checks or conditions. This function call should not be made if it is None.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _recache() function to check if self._marker_function is not None before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the _marker_function() is only called when it exists. This should fix the bug and make the test pass.
