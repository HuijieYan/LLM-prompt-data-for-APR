The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to correctly update the marker style based on the input parameters. 

The issue seems to be that the `_marker_function` is not being called properly or the logic within the `_marker_function` is not correctly updating the marker properties. This is causing the marker properties to remain unchanged, leading to the failing test case.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is being called correctly and that it correctly updates the marker properties based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
            self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that the `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. Additionally, we have updated the `_filled` property based on the value of `_fillstyle`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
