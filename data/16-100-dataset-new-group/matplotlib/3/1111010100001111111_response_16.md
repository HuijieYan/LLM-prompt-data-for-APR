The bug in the `_recache` function is that it always sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the input `self._fillstyle` value. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle='none'` is intended.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` input value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we set the `_filled` attribute to `True` only if the `self._fillstyle` is not equal to 'none', which means the markers should be filled for any other `fillstyle` values.

This correction will ensure that the markers are properly filled or hollow based on the `fillstyle` attribute, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
