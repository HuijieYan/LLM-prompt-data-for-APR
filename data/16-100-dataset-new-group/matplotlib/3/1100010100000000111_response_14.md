## Analysis
The issue on GitHub is related to setting markers to be hollow using `ax.scatter()` and `markers.MarkerStyle()`. The problem seems to be with the fillstyle parameter not working as expected, resulting in the markers not being filled with none.

## Error Location
The issue is likely occurring in the `_recache` function within the `markers.py` file, as this function is responsible for handling the marker properties.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the `_recache` function not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter when setting markers to be hollow.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter when setting markers to be hollow.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Changing filled to False to make markers hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` property to `False` instead of `True`, which should correctly handle making the markers hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and `markers.MarkerStyle()`.
