## Analysis
The `MarkerStyle` class does not have a method named `is_filled()`, which is causing the failing test. The `MarkerStyle` class should have an attribute or method to check if the marker is filled or hollow.

## Bug cause
The bug is caused by the `MarkerStyle` class not having an `is_filled()` method, which is called but does not exist. This causes the test to fail, and the markers to not appear as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.

## Fix strategy
To fix the bug, the `MarkerStyle` class needs to be updated to have a method or attribute to check if the marker is filled or hollow. The `_recache` function might also need modification to set the `filled` attribute based on `fillstyle`.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

class MarkerStyle:
    # existing code ...

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, the `MarkerStyle` class is updated to include the `is_filled` method, and the `_recache` function is modified to update the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
