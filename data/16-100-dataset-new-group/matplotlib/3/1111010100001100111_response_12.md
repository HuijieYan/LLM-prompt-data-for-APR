Potential error locations:
- The _recache function sets self._filled to True but should be False when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect setting of the self._filled variable. When fillstyle is set to 'none', the marker should be hollow (i.e., not filled), but the _recache function is setting self._filled to True, which is incorrect.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Update the _recache function to correctly set the self._filled variable based on the fillstyle parameter.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled variable based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
