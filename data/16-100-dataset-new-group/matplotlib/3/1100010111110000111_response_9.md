The bug in the `_recache` function within `markers.py` is causing the marker to not behave as expected when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is specifically testing for this behavior and is failing because the marker is still considered as being filled.

The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without setting `self._marker_function` to any actual function. This means that the function is being called, but it does not exist, leading to unexpected behavior in marker appearance.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to only call `self._marker_function()` if it is actually defined. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the `_recache` function now first checks if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, ensuring that it is only called when it actually exists.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and also pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` by correctly handling the `fillstyle='none'` case.
