The buggy function _recache in the MarkerStyle class is intended to re-cache the marker properties. However, it contains a potential bug as it calls the _marker_function without checking if it is defined.

The cause of the bug is that there is no check to ensure that _marker_function is defined before calling it, which could lead to an AttributeError if _marker_function is not defined.

To fix the bug, we should add a check to ensure that _marker_function is defined before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Add a check to ensure that _marker_function is not None
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check if self._marker_function is not None before calling it, we can prevent the potential AttributeError and ensure that the function is only called when it is defined.
