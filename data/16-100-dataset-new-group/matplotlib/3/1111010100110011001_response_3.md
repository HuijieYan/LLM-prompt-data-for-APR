The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the attributes and calling the `_marker_function`. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not setting the `_marker_function` correctly, which is causing the `is_filled` method to return the wrong value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is properly set and that it is being called correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker and self._fillstyle:
        self._set_marker(self._marker, self._fillstyle)
        if self._alt_path is not None:
            self._alt_transform = Affine2D().scale(1.0, 1.0)
    else:
        self._set_fillstyle('none')
```
