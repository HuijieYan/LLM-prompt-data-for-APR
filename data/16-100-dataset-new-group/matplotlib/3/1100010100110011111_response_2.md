## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the `is_filled` method of the MarkerStyle class. In the provided code, the `_recache` method is supposed to update the `_filled` attribute based on the marker function, but it is not doing so correctly. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated correctly based on the marker function.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = not self._marker_function().is_hollow()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `is_hollow` method of the marker function, we ensure that the correct value is set for the `_filled` attribute, which will resolve the issue and also pass the failing test.
