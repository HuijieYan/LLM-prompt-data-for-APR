## Bug Fix
The bug occurs in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, where the `self._filled` attribute is being incorrectly set to `True` before the marker function is called. This results in the markers not being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. Additionally, we need to update the `marker_function` to correctly handle the `fillstyle`.

### Updated Buggy Function
```python
# The declared class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The fixed version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With the updated `_recache` method, the `self._filled` attribute is now correctly set based on the `fillstyle`, ensuring that markers are hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none'.

By making this change, the `MarkerStyle` class will handle the fillstyle correctly and ensure that markers appear as expected when using `ax.scatter()` as reported in the GitHub issue.
