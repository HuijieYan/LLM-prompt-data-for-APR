def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = Affine2D()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = 1.0
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for setting up the marker properties. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the markers are not being displayed as hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'. This indicates that the `_fill` property is not being properly handled within the `_recache` function.

To fix the bug, the `_transform` property should be set to `Affine2D()` instead of `IdentityTransform()`, and the `_filled` property should be set to `False` instead of `True`. Additionally, the `_snap_threshold` property should be set to a default value, and the `_marker_function` should be called after setting the properties.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and ensures that the markers are displayed as hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'.
