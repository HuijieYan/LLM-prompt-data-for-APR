The buggy function `_recache` is not properly setting the fillstyle of the marker, which is causing the failing test. When the fillstyle is set to 'none', the marker should not be filled, but the function is not correctly updating the `_filled` variable.

The bug is caused by the function not properly updating the `_filled` variable when the fillstyle is set to 'none', resulting in the marker being incorrectly filled.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the fillstyle and update the `_filled` variable accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the fillstyle, the corrected function ensures that the marker is filled or not filled according to the specified fillstyle. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
