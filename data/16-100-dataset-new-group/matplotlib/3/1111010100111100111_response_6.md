The issue with the `is_filled` method seems to be related to the `_recache` method not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute. 

The `_recache` method sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally. This leads to the `is_filled` method always returning `True` even when the fillstyle is set to 'none' as in the failing test case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` method to properly update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` method:
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        # Correctly set the _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` method as shown, the `_filled` attribute will now correctly reflect the fillstyle, and the `is_filled` method will work as expected.

This fix will resolve the failing test case and also address the issue reported on GitHub.

Additionally, the corrected version will ensure that when using `scatter` and setting the fillstyle to 'none', the markers will appear hollow as intended.

Please note that the above code assumes that the `MarkerStyle` class is part of the `matplotlib.markers` module.
