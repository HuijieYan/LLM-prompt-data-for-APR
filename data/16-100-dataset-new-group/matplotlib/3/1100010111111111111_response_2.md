The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the `is_filled` method in `test_marker_fillstyle` to return `True` instead of `False`, leading to the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` variable is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, while it should be set based on the value of the `self._fillstyle` parameter.

To fix this bug, we should update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle not in ('none', 'full')
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, which should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.

This fix also addresses the issue reported on GitHub, where markers were not appearing as hollow when `fillstyle` was set to 'none'. This fix ensures that the markers will appear as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.
