The buggy function `_recache` in the class `MarkerStyle` is failing to set the `_filled` attribute correctly, which leads to the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally within the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This results in the failing test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should take the `fillstyle` parameter into account and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test should pass.
