## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly setting the marker to be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This is causing the markers to not appear as hollow as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.

## Potential Error Locations:
The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` parameter within the `_recache` function. The function needs to properly update the marker style based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not correctly updating the marker style when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This causes the markers to not appear as hollow as desired when using `ax.scatter()`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The `_recache` function needs to be modified to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and update the marker style accordingly. This can be done by checking the value of `fillstyle` and setting the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top']:
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```
By checking the value of `fillstyle` and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that the markers will appear as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.
