class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() not in ['none', 'full']
        self._marker_function()
    
```

The bug in the original function was that it was not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle. By adding the condition `self.get_fillstyle() not in ['none', 'full']` and setting `_filled` accordingly, the bug is fixed.

This change ensures that the `_filled` attribute is only set to True if the fillstyle is not 'none' or 'full', which aligns with the expected behavior of the marker being filled.

With this correction, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` should now pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
