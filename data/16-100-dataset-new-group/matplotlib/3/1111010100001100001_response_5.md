The buggy function `_recache` is not properly reusing the `_marker_function` and is not taking into account the input parameter `self._fillstyle`.

The bug in the function is that it is not using the `self._fillstyle` parameter to determine whether the marker should be filled or not. It also doesn't make use of the `_marker_function` to update the marker style.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to incorporate the `self._fillstyle` parameter to determine if the marker should be filled, and also make sure to use the `_marker_function` to update the marker style.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._marker_function()

        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
            
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to use the `_fillstyle` parameter to determine if the marker should be filled or not. We also ensured that the `_marker_function` is called to update the marker style.
