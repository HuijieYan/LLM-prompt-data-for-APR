### The buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, corresponding error message, and GitHub issue
The buggy function `_recache` is called when creating a `MarkerStyle` object. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` calls the `MarkerStyle` with specific parameters and asserts that the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' and that the marker is not filled. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. The GitHub issue also points out a similar problem where setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' does not produce the expected hollow markers. 

### Potential error location within the buggy function
The issue may be related to the value of the `_filled` attribute not being properly set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the `_filled` attribute not being correctly updated based on the value of `fillstyle`, resulting in the `is_filled` method returning the incorrect value.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle` when the `MarkerStyle` object is created.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the value of `fillstyle` before the `_marker_function` is called. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value, and the markers will be rendered as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
