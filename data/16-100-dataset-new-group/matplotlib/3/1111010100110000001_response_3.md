The bug in the `MarkerStyle` class is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is evident from the error message in the failing test, which shows that `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` is failing.

The `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recalculate the marker properties when called. However, the bug is likely occurring because the `_marker_function` is not being set correctly, or it is not being called with the appropriate arguments.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` method needs to be updated to correctly recalculate the marker properties. This may involve setting the `_marker_function` attribute to a proper marker function and calling it with the necessary arguments to recalculate the properties.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Corrected - should be set to False for 'none' fillstyle
        self._marker_function()  # The marker function should be called to recalculate properties
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute to `False` for 'none' fillstyle and ensuring that the `_marker_function` is set correctly and called with the appropriate arguments, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass.
