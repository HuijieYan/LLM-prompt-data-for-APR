The issue here is that the `MarkerStyle` class's `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is causing the test to fail and also the reported issue on GitHub.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` unconditionally in the `_recache` method, regardless of the `fillstyle` being set to 'none'. This leads to the `is_filled` method incorrectly returning `False` when it should actually return `True` in the case of `fillstyle='none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` method to take into account the `fillstyle` value when setting the `_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Check fillstyle value
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` method will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, and the `is_filled` method will return the expected result, resolving the failing test and the GitHub issue.
