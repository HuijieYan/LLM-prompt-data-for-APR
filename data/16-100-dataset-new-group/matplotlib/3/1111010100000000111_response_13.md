## Analysis
The `_recache` function is responsible for updating the marker style attributes. The issue on GitHub indicates that the `fillstyle='none'` parameter is not working as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue might be related to how the `_filled` attribute is being handled within the `_recache` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This results in the markers not appearing as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle='none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
