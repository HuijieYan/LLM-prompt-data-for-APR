The bug in the code lies in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute only if the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the correct `fillstyle` will be reflected in the `_filled` attribute, and the failing test should pass.
