## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is called when a marker style is created or modified. The GitHub issue indicates that when the `fillstyle` of the marker is set to `'none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected when using `ax.scatter()`. This indicates that the `_recache` function is not handling the `fillstyle` parameter correctly.

## Potential Error Locations
The `_recache` function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which is likely the cause of the issue reported on GitHub. This prevents the markers from being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. 

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `_recache` function causes markers to be filled even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, resulting in unexpected behavior when using `ax.scatter()`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to respect the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the `_filled` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` to create hollow markers.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if 'none' in self.get_fillstyle():
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` of the marker. If the `fillstyle` contains the string 'none', the `_filled` attribute is set to False, indicating that the markers should be hollow. Otherwise, the `_filled` attribute is set to True to fill the markers. This correction ensures that the markers will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` as expected.
