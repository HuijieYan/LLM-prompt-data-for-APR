The bug in the _recache function is the incorrect assignment of the _filled variable. It is being set to True unconditionally, which is not consistent with the input parameters of the failing test. It should be using the self._fillstyle value to determine its value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to set the _filled attribute based on the value of self._fillstyle.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the _recache function now takes into account the value of self._fillstyle and sets the _filled attribute accordingly. This fix ensures that the function behaves as expected in the failing test case.
