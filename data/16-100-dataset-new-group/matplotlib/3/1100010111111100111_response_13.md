## Analysis:

1. The buggy function `_recache` is called when creating a new `MarkerStyle` object. In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, the test fails when checking if the marker is filled or not.
2. The failure in the test indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning the wrong value, likely due to a misconfiguration in the `_recache` function.
3. The failing test uses a `MarkerStyle` object with a fillstyle of `'none'`.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that setting the fillstyle to 'none' should result in a hollow marker, but it's not working as expected.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_recache` sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the `is_filled()` method to always return `True`, even when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the fillstyle and set `_filled` accordingly. If the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` object will correctly handle the fillstyle and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` will pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
