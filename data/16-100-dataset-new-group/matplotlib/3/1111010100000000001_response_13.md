The buggy function _recache is not properly implemented. The _marker_function is being called without being assigned, and the subsequent lines will throw an error due to this.

To fix this bug, we need to define the _marker_function and then call it within the _recache function. Additionally, we need to take care of any potential errors in the _marker_function itself.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
In this corrected version, we check if self._marker_function is not None before calling it to avoid any potential errors.
