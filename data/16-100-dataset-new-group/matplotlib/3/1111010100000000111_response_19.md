# The buggy function is the _recache method of the MarkerStyle class, which is responsible for caching the marker properties.

# Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The conditional check if self._marker_function is None might not be sufficient to determine if the marker function is set or not.
2. The _marker_function is called without checking if it exists or not, which might lead to the issue described in the GitHub problem.

# Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the marker function. The _recache method does not properly check if the marker function exists before calling it, leading to unexpected behavior when setting fillstyle to 'none'.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add a proper check to ensure that _marker_function is not None before calling it.
2. Modify the _marker_function to handle the fillstyle parameter correctly.


# Corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function and callable(self._marker_function):  # Check if _marker_function exists and is callable
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
