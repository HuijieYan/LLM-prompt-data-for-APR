## Analysis
The error message is indicating that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations
The `_recache` function resets the marker attributes, and it's possible that it is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` when it should not be.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which is not correct for all markers.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to ensure that the `_recache` function does not unconditionally set the `_filled` attribute to `True`, as it should depend on the marker specification.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._marker is not None and self._marker != ' ':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the condition of the marker not being `None` and not being an empty string. This aligns with the behavior expected from the context of the error.
