## Analysis
The error message indicates that the function `is_filled` is not returning the correct value. It seems that the `_filled` attribute is not being set properly in the `_recache` function, which is causing the `is_filled` method to return the wrong result.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, regardless of what it should be based on the marker style.

## Cause of Bug
The `_recache` function unconditionally sets `_filled` to `True` for all marker styles, which causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`. This is incorrect for marker styles that should not be filled.

## Suggested Fix
The `_recache` function should set the `_filled` attribute based on the marker style. If the fill style is 'none', `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fill style
    self._marker_function()
```
