The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is missing a reference to `self`, which is causing the `marker_function` to not be called properly. This results in the `is_filled` method not being set correctly, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `marker_function` is called using the `self` reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function(self)
```

By passing `self` as an argument to the `_marker_function`, the function will be able to access and modify the attributes of the instance, fixing the bug.
