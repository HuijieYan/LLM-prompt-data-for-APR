## Bug Fix

The bug is in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, where `self._filled` is always set to `True`, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This leads to the incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled or not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and also pass the failing test.

This change ensures that when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker will be hollow as expected, and the corresponding test case will now pass.
