## Analysis
The issue on GitHub reports that markers are not hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none'. The issue seems to be related to the function _recache() in the markers.py file.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue might be related to how the marker style is being set and cached within the _recache() function.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the _recache() function is not properly handling the fillstyle parameter when setting the marker style. This results in markers not being hollow as expected when using ax.scatter().

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the fillstyle parameter is properly handled within the _recache() function. We need to modify the function to properly set the marker style with the fillstyle parameter taken into account.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set filled to False to make markers hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we have changed the line `self._filled = True` to `self._filled = False` to ensure that markers are hollow when the fillstyle parameter is set to 'none'. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
