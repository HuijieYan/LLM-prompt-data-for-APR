## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the bug is fixed by ensuring that the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `_fillstyle` attribute. This change will accurately reflect whether the marker is filled or not based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` class.

By making this change, the corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue posted in GitHub related to markers not being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
