To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. We also need to update the `is_filled` method to return the correct value based on the `fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False`, ensuring that the markers are hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

Now, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass with the corrected version of the function. This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub, ensuring that setting `fillstyle='none'` results in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.

By incorporating the fix above, the `MarkerStyle` class should now correctly set the filled attribute based on the fillstyle and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
