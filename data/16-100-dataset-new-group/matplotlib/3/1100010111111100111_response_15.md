The buggy function is `_recache` which is a method of the class `MarkerStyle` in the `markers.py` file. The function is called when properties of the marker style are altered, and it is supposed to update the internal representation of the marker. However, it currently is not setting the `filled` property based on the `fillstyle`.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in the file `test_marker.py` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `marker='o'` and `fillstyle='none'`, and then checks whether `is_filled()` returns `False`, which should be the case if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is causing the assertion to fail.

The GitHub issue also confirms this problem, where the user is trying to create a scatter plot with hollow markers by setting `fillstyle='none'`, but it's not working as expected.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` method should update the `filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then the `filled` property should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This change sets the `_filled` property based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, ensuring that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will be hollow.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved.
