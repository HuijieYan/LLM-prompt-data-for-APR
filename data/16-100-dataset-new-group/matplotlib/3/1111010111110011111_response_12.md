The issue with the `MarkerStyle` function is that it is not properly handling the `fillstyle` attribute that is being set. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be returning `False` based on the provided test case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute so that it reflects the intended behavior and the `is_filled` method returns the correct value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
   
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Check fillstyle and update filled attribute
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version of the function, we added a conditional check for the `fillstyle` attribute. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, we set the `_filled` attribute to `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled. Otherwise, we set `_filled` as `True`.

With this fix, the `is_filled` method should return the correct value and the failing test case should pass.

This fix addresses the GitHub issue where the markers were not hollow when `ax.scatter()` was used and the `fillstyle` was set to `'none'`. The provided code for reproduction in the GitHub issue should now work as expected.
