Based on the input/output values and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `_recache` function is that the `self._filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the input `self._fillstyle` value.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function, which contradicts the expected behavior of setting it to `False` when `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_recache` function to correctly set the `self._filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

### Corrected version of the `_recache` function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional statement to check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set `self._filled` accordingly. If `self._fillstyle` is not `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `True`, otherwise, it is set to `False`, which aligns with the expected behavior.

This corrected version of the `_recache` function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
