The buggy function `_recache` sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` by default, which is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` instead of the expected `False` when the marker fillstyle is set to `'none'`. This is consistent with the failing test and the GitHub issue, as the user is trying to create hollow markers by setting the fillstyle to `'none', but it's not working as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle. If the fillstyle is `'none'`, the marker should not be filled, so `_filled` should be set to `False` in this case.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the fillstyle, the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue posted on GitHub.
