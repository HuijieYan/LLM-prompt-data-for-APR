Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_recache` function is likely due to the `_marker_function` not being properly defined or called. The `marker_function` needs to be called to correctly set the marker's properties, which is missing in the original code. The failure of the test result indicates that the marker is not properly set to be unfilled when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

To fix the bug, the `_marker_function` needs to be properly defined and called to handle the logic of setting the marker style and properties. The corrected version should ensure that the `_marker_function` is being called and that its implementation sets the marker to be unfilled when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function:
            self._path = self._marker_function()
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
```

In this corrected version, the `_marker_function` is called using `self._marker_function()` to properly update the marker's properties. Then, the fill style is set based on the return value of `self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'`, ensuring that the marker is filled or unfilled based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

This fix should resolve the bug and ensure that the marker is correctly set to be unfilled when `fillstyle='none'` is used, passing the failing test and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
