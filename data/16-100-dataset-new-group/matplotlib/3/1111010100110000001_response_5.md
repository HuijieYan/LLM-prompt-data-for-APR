## Analysis
The `MarkerStyle` class has a method `_recache` that is intended to update the cached representation of the marker style. However, there is a bug in this method that is causing it to fail. The failing test is trying to determine if a marker is filled or not, but it is not returning the correct value.

## Potential Error
The cause of the bug is likely in the `_recache` method where the `_marker_function` should be called, but it seems to be resulting in an incorrect value.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug appears to be caused by not setting the `_marker_function` correctly, resulting in a False value that causes the test to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is set to the correct function that determines if a marker is filled or not.

## The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function and set the result to _filled
```
