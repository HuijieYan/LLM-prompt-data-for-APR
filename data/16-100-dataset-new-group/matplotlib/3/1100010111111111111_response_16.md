## The fixed version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Corrected this line from True to False
    self._marker_function()
```

The issue was caused by an incorrect setting of the `_filled` variable. Changing it to `False` instead of `True` will ensure that the marker is hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
