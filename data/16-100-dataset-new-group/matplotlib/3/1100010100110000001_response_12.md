## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value. This method is being called on the `MarkerStyle` object, and it should check if the marker is considered filled or not. Since the failing test is related to the fillstyle of a marker, the bug may be related to setting the filled attribute in the `recache` function.

## Bug Location
The bug may be in the `recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True`. This may be causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should not.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the default setting of `_filled` to `True` in the `recache` function. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True` regardless of the actual marker properties.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the marker's actual fillstyle. We should also ensure that the `is_filled` method reflects this change.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, we set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle of the marker by calling the `get_fillstyle` method. This will ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the actual fillstyle of the marker, and the `is_filled` method will behave as expected.
