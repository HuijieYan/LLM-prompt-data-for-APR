The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle the case where the `_marker_function` attribute is not None, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `_marker_function` attribute is not None before calling it. If it is None, we should return without performing any further operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check for the `_marker_function` attribute before calling it, we ensure that the function will only be called if it is not None, preventing any potential issues with calling a None type object.

With this fix, the function should now handle the case where `_marker_function` is None correctly and avoid any unexpected behavior or errors.
