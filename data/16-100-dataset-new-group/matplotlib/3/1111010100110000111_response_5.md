## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache the marker style attributes. However, the function is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute, leading to the failing test case and the reported issue on GitHub.

## Potential Error Locations
The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which is likely causing the markers not to be hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

## Cause of the Bug
The `_recache` function is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter, leading to markers being filled even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This causes the failing test case and the reported issue on GitHub.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow.

## The Corrected Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With the corrected function, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing markers to be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This should resolve the failing test case and address the reported issue on GitHub.
