To fix the bug in the _recache function of the MarkerStyle class, we need to ensure that the is_filled function returns the correct value based on the fillstyle parameter. Currently, the function is returning True by default, which is causing the test failure.

We can update the _recache function to set the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter. If the fillstyle is set to 'none', then _filled should be set to False. This will ensure that the is_filled function returns the correct value.

Here is the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _filled attribute will be set based on the fillstyle parameter, and the is_filled function will return the correct value.

This should resolve the issue with the marker not being hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting the fillstyle to 'none'.

The corrected version of the _recache function ensures that the _filled attribute is set correctly based on the fillstyle parameter. This will ensure that the is_filled function returns the correct value, resolving the test failure and the issue reported on GitHub.
