The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `self._filled` variable is being set to `False` instead of `True`, which is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set `self._filled` to `True` instead of `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Fixed potential error location
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Corrected the bug
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function should now set `self._filled` to `True`, which matches the expected value for the failing test.
