## The analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class does not correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter, which leads to the marker not being rendered as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.

The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object and expecting it to return `False` when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. However, the current implementation returns `True` for all cases, indicating that the marker is always filled regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

The GitHub issue also confirms the problem, as the user's expectation for setting `fillstyle` to 'none' is for the markers to be hollow, but the current behavior does not reflect that.

## Bug location
The bug is located inside the `_recache` method where the `self._filled` attribute is always set to `True`, and it is not conditioned on the `fillstyle` parameter value.

## Bug cause
The bug occurs because the `_recache` method doesn't correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. The `self._filled` attribute is always set to `True`, which is incorrect when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. As a result, the markers are always filled, leading to the failing test and the issue reported in GitHub.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `self._filled` attribute reflects the correct filling behavior based on the `fillstyle` parameter. When `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers should be hollow (not filled), and `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

## The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Set self._filled based on fillstyle
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `self._filled` attribute will be correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `self._filled` is set to `False`, and the markers will be hollow as expected.

This correction should resolve the failing test and the issue reported in GitHub.
