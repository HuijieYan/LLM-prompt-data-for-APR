The potential error in the buggy function is that it always calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists, which could lead to unexpected behavior. This might be the reason why the marker is not hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, modify the `_recache` function to check if `self._marker_function` is not None, and only then call it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will only call `self._marker_function()` if it's not None, preventing unexpected behavior and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
