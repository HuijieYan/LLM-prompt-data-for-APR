## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The GitHub issue indicates that when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected. The issue includes code for reproduction, which demonstrates the problem.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

The issue could be related to the way the `_recache` function initializes the marker properties, particularly the `_filled` property, and how the `marker_function` is being called.

## Cause of the bug

The buggy function `_recache` does not correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter when setting up markers. This leads to the issue reported on GitHub where markers are not being rendered as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `fillstyle` parameter is correctly handled within the `_recache` function. Additionally, we need to verify that the `marker_function` is being called appropriately to reflect the `fillstyle` setting.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated to handle fillstyle
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._joinstyle = 'miter'  # Set join style to miter for hollow markers
            self._capstyle = 'projecting'  # Set cap style to projecting for hollow markers

        self._marker_function(self._fillstyle)  # Pass fillstyle to marker_function
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. We set the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` value, and if `fillstyle` is `'none'`, we also update the `joinstyle` and `capstyle` to render hollow markers. The `fillstyle` value is also passed to the `marker_function` to ensure that it reflects the desired appearance of the marker.
