There are a few potential issues with the _recache function:

1. The condition `if self._marker_function is None` should be changed to `if self._marker is None` as the intention is to check if a marker is present or not.

2. The line `self._marker_function()` doesn't seem to be the correct way to call the marker function. It should be replaced with the correct method for retrieving the marker function.

3. The method `get_fillstyle` is not defined in the MarkerStyle class. This needs to be defined or accessed in the correct way.

The cause of the bug is that the method is trying to access a function `self._marker_function` which is never initialized, hence leading to an error.

To fix the bug, the _recache function needs to be modified to correctly check for the presence of a marker and then call the appropriate function to initialize the marker.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = Affine2D()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        # Call the appropriate method to initialize the marker
        self._set_marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we assume that there is a method called `_set_marker_function` which will correctly initialize the marker function based on the marker specified.
