The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the markers to not appear hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' in the `MarkerStyle`. This is evident from the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()`.

The potential error location in the `_recache` function is the initialization of the `_filled` attribute to `True`. This conflicts with the intention of creating a hollow marker when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

The cause of the bug is that when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` to create a hollow marker. However, in the current implementation, it is being set to `True` by default.

To fix the bug, the strategy is to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` is 'none'.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False`, and the markers will appear hollow as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and pass the failing test.
