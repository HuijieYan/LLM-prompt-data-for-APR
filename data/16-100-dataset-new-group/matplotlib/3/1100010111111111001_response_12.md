The buggy function is setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior of the `MarkerStyle` class. This leads to the failing test, as it expects the marker to be filled (`marker_style.is_filled()` should return `True`) but it returns `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` attribute. If the `_fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be `False`, otherwise it should be `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the `MarkerStyle` class should now correctly represent whether the marker is filled based on the `fillstyle` attribute.
