The bug in the code is that the `_marker_function` is being called without the `self` parameter, which is causing an issue with accessing the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object.

To fix the bug, the `self` parameter needs to be passed to the `_marker_function` method.

Here's the corrected version of the code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function(self)
```
