The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, which overrides the `fillstyle='none'` setting and makes the markers filled. This is causing the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub where markers are not appearing as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` setting and correctly set the `_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the markers will appear as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none',` which should resolve both the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
