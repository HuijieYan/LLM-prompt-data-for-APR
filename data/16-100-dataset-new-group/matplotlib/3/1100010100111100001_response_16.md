The bug in the provided code is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` instead of `False` in the `_recache` function. This is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute to `False` in the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set _filled attribute to False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `is_filled()` method should now return the correct value, and the failing test should pass.
