The issue is likely occurring because the _recache function in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library is not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter when creating MarkerStyle objects. This leads to the markers not appearing as hollow when fillstyle='none' is set.

To fix this issue, we need to update the _recache function in the markers.py file to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter when creating MarkerStyle objects.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we update the value of self._filled based on the fillstyle parameter. If fillstyle is set to 'none', then self._filled is set to False, making the marker hollow. Otherwise, self._filled remains True.

With this correction, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the markers should appear as hollow when fillstyle='none' is set.
