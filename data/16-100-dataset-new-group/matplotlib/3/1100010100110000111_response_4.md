### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value, causing the test to fail. This is related to the issue posted in GitHub where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

### Identified potential error location:
The potential error location is within the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is being called in the failing test.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` method not properly setting the `_filled` attribute to the appropriate value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to update the `_recache` method to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the expected value when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` method as shown above, the bug will be fixed. The `is_filled` method will now return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test should pass.
