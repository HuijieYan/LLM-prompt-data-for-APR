The buggy function `_recache` is failing to properly set the fillstyle of the marker, which is causing the test to fail.

The potential error location in the `_recache` function is with the assignment of the `_filled` attribute. It is set to `True` regardless of the fillstyle specified.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is always being set to `True`, irrespective of the fillstyle specified, causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False` for markers with `fillstyle='none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the fillstyle and set the `_filled` attribute based on the specified fillstyle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the specified fillstyle, and the failing test should pass.
