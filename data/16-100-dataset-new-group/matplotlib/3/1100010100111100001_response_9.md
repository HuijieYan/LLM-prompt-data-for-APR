The bug in the _recache function is that it always sets the _filled attribute to True, regardless of the value of the fillstyle. This causes the is_filled method to return True when it should return False for fillstyle='none'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to set the _filled attribute based on the value of the fillstyle. If the fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the _filled attribute will be set based on the fillstyle, and the failing tests should pass.

After applying this fix, the failing test for the marker fillstyle should pass without any AssertionError.
