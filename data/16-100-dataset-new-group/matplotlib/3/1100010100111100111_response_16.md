The bug in the code is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle='none'`. This is causing the failing test where `marker_style.is_filled()` is expected to return `False` but it returns `True` instead.

To fix this bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` being 'none' or not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on whether the `fillstyle` is 'none' or not. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` set for the marker style.

This fix should resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub where setting `fillstyle='none'` did not result in hollow markers as expected.
