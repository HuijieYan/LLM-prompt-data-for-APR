### Analysis
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains the `_recache` function which is supposed to recalculate the marker style attributes. 
2. The failing test is checking the `is_filled()` function which depends on the `_filled` attribute being set to `True`. 
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` is failing, meaning that the `is_filled()` function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
4. The `_recache` function is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the `is_filled()` function to always return `True`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the fillstyle.

### Updated and corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this updated version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` will be set to `False`, otherwise it will be set to `True`. This should resolve the failing test.
