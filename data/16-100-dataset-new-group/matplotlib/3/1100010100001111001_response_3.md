The bug in the function `_recache` appears to be related to the assignment of the variable `self._filled`. In the provided runtime values, the expected value of `self._filled` is `True`, but the buggy function always sets it to `True`. We need to update the function to correctly assign the value of `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the value of `self._filled` is determined based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, which is expected to fix the bug.
