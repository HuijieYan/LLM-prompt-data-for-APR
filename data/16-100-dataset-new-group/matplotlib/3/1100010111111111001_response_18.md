The bug is in the `_recache` function, which is responsible for setting the properties of the `MarkerStyle` object. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking for the `is_filled` method, which should return `False` when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

The bug occurs because the `_filled` property is set to `True` unconditionally inside the `_recache` function. However, it should depend on the value of `self._fillstyle`. Since the function is not correctly checking for the fillstyle, the property is always set to `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` and set the `_filled` property accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle in ('full', 'left', 'right'):
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the function to check the `fillstyle` and set the `_filled` property accordingly, the failing test should pass now.
