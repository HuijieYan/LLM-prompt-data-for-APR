To fix the bug in the _recache function, we need to ensure that the behavior of the function aligns with the expected input/output values and the failing test. Based on the failing test and the expected input/output values provided, it seems that the bug is related to the setting of the marker's fillstyle.

The bug seems to be related to the _filled attribute not properly handling the fillstyle parameter when creating custom markers. The failing test specifically checks for the fillstyle 'none' and expects the marker to be hollow, but the current implementation of _recache does not properly handle custom marker styles.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to properly handle the fillstyle attribute when creating custom markers.

Below is the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle attribute of the marker. This change ensures that the _filled attribute reflects the intended fillstyle and aligns with the expectations of the failing test.

By implementing this change, the _recache function should now handle custom markers with the fillstyle parameter correctly, resolving the issue reported in GitHub and passing the failing test.
