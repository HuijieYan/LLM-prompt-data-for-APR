## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return the incorrect value. We need to ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` in the `_recache` method.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    # the corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False  # Setting filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle`, ensuring that it correctly represents whether the marker is filled or not. This should fix the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
