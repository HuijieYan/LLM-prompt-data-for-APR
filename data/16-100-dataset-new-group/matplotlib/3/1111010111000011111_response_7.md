The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the marker properties when the `_marker_function` is not None. This seems to be causing issues with the fillstyle option. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', but it's not working as expected due to the bug in the `_recache` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function does not correctly handle the fillstyle parameter, causing the marker to not appear as hollow when it should.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` function correctly sets the fillstyle parameter based on the input passed to the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        if 'fillstyle' in self._marker:
            self.set_fillstyle(self._marker['fillstyle'])
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will correctly use the `fillstyle` parameter if it's present when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. If not, it will default to being filled.

This correction addresses the reported issue on GitHub and ensures that the marker is hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' as expected.
