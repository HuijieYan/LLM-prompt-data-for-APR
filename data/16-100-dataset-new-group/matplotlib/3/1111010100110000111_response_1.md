## Analysis:
The `_recache` function is not correctly re-initializing the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class when the `_marker_function` is not None. This is causing the failing test which expects the `is_filled` method to return False when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

## Identified potential error location:
The bug is likely in the `_recache` function where it is not correctly resetting the state of the `MarkerStyle` class.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing the `is_filled` method to return True when it should return False. This is because the `_recache` function is not properly resetting the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This issue is described in the GitHub issue where the user expects the markers to be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', but it's not working as expected.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to properly reset the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class when the `_marker_function` is not None. Specifically, the `_filled` attribute should be set to False when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
With this correction, the `is_filled` method should return the expected value based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test should pass.
