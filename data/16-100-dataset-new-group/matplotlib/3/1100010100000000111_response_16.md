## Analysis
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting the `fillstyle` parameter of `markers.MarkerStyle` to 'none' does not produce a hollow marker as expected when using `ax.scatter()`. This implies that the `fillstyle` parameter is not being applied properly in the `_recache` function of the `markers.py` file.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location in the `_recache` function is the assignment of `self._filled` to `True`, which may be overriding the effect of setting `fillstyle` to 'none' in the `MarkerStyle`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_filled` variable being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which overrides the effect of setting `fillstyle` to 'none' in the `MarkerStyle`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_filled` variable in the `_recache` function should be assigned based on the value of `fillstyle` in the `MarkerStyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False` to produce a hollow marker.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the value of `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the function ensures that the hollow marker is generated when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
