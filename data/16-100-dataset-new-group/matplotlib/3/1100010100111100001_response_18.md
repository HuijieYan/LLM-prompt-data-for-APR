The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be related to the `self._filled` variable not being set correctly, leading to the failure of the `is_filled` method. This is evident from the error message and the runtime values of the variables.

The `self._filled` variable is being set to `True` unconditionally within the `_recache` function, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This results in the incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly set the `self._filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` variable is set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` will be `False`, otherwise, it will be `True`.

This correction should address the bug and ensure that the `is_filled` method behaves as expected, passing the failing test.
