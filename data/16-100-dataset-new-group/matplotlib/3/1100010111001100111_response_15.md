The issue is caused by the `_recache` function not properly setting the marker to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`. This causes the markers to be filled instead of hollow as expected.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the case where `fillstyle='none'` is set, ensuring that the marker is rendered as hollow.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the markers will be rendered correctly as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

This fix will ensure that the markers are rendered as hollow when using the `markers.MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
