## Fixing the Bug

From the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem is related to markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This indicates that the _filled attribute should be set to False when the fillstyle is 'none'. Therefore, the bug in the _recache function appears to be related to not updating the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter.

To fix this bug, the _recache function needs to check the fillstyle parameter and update the _filled attribute accordingly.

### Fixing the Bug - Corrected Version

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the _filled attribute is updated based on the fillstyle parameter. If fillstyle is 'none', then _filled is set to False, otherwise it is set to True.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the markers are hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
