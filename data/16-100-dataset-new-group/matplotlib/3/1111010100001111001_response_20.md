The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`. This may be causing unexpected behavior in the rest of the code that relies on this attribute.

To fix this bug, we should update the function to properly set the `_filled` attribute to `True` before calling the `_marker_function`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Set _filled to True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be properly set to `True` before the `_marker_function` is called, satisfying the expected behavior.
