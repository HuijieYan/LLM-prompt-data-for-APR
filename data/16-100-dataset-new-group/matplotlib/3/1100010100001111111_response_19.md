## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Setting _filled to False for markers to be hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

The bug was in setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` in the original function. This caused markers to be filled instead of hollow. By correcting this and setting `_filled` to `False`, the issue with markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to `none` should be resolved.
