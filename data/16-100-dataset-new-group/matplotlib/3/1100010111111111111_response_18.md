The issue is related to the `MarkerStyle` not being correctly set as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. The `_recache` function is responsible for setting the marker's properties, such as `filled`, but it is not updating this property when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

The cause of the bug:
- The `filled` property is not being updated when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
- This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False`, leading to the failing test and the incorrect marker appearance.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `filled` property based on the `fillstyle` value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set the `self._filled` property accordingly. If `self._fillstyle` is 'none', then `self._filled` is set to `False`, indicating a hollow marker. Otherwise, it is set to `True` as the default behavior.
