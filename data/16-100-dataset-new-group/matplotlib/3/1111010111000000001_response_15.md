## Fixing the bug

### 1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with buggy class, test code.
The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is used in the `test_marker_fillstyle` test to create a `MarkerStyle` object and check its fill style.

### 2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
The potential error lies in the line `self._marker_function()` because it is being called without checking if it exists or not. This could raise an AttributeError.

### 3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test.
The `_recache` function attempts to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is `None` or not. This can lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined, causing the test to fail.

### 4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
The bug can be fixed by adding a check to see if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function.

### 5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version.
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With the corrected version, the `_recache` function will first check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it, thus preventing the possibility of an AttributeError. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
