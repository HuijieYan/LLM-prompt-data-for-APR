## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` sets the marker properties including the fillstyle, but the issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in a hollow marker as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if self._marker_function is None` may not handle the case where the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' correctly.
2. The assignment of `self._filled = True` may be overriding the `fillstyle` setting.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by a conflict between the `fillstyle` setting and the `_filled` attribute. When `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker should be hollow, but the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` may be preventing this from happening.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the condition `if self._marker_function is None` to correctly handle the case where `fillstyle='none'`.
2. Update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` setting to ensure it doesn't override the desired marker style.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
