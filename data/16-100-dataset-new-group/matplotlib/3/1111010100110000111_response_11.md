Potential error locations within the buggy function:
The issue appears to be related to the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value.

Cause of the bug:
The `_recache` function is not properly setting the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to incorrect behavior in the `is_filled` method, which in turn causes the failing test.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Update to properly set self._filled based on fillstyle
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the bug should be resolved and the failing test should pass.
