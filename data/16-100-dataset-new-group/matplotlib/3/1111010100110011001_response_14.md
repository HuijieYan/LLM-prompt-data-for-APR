The bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is that it is not properly reassigning the `_filled` attribute before calling the `_marker_function`. This results in the `is_filled` method returning `False` instead of `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is properly set before calling the `_marker_function`. We can do this by adding a line to set `_filled` to `True` before calling `_marker_function`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Set _filled attribute to True
    self._marker_function()
```

After making this change, the `is_filled` method should return `True` as expected in the failing test.
