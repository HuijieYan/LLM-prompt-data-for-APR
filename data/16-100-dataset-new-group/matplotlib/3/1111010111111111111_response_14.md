To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to update the `_filled` variable to reflect the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to indicate that the marker should be hollow.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` variable will be set to `True` if the `fillstyle` is anything other than `'none'`, indicating that the marker should be filled. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` will be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass, while also aligning with the expected input/output values.
