The bug in the _recache function is causing the failing test to assert that the marker_style is not filled when it should be. The error message shows that the is_filled method is returning True, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the _filled attribute is set to the correct value for the MarkerStyle class.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the _filled attribute to False, we ensure that the MarkerStyle is not filled, which will make the failing test pass.
