The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes the `_filled` variable as `True` regardless of the input value of `self._fillstyle`. This is a potential cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to take into account the input value of `self._fillstyle` and set the `_filled` variable accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to set `_filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False`. Otherwise, it is set to `True`, as per the expected behavior.
