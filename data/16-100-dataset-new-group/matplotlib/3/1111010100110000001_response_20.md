The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the marker function. This causes the failing test related to the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set according to the marker function before calling it.

A corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function() is not None  # Ensure the filled state is based on the marker function result
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the result of the `_marker_function` before calling the function on the last line. This will ensure that the correct filled state is set for the marker style, and the failing test should pass with this correction.
