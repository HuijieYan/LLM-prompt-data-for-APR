The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is failing due to the incorrect implementation of the `is_filled` method. The `is_filled` method is expected to return the value of the `_filled` attribute, but it is currently returning itself as a bound method.

To fix this bug, the `is_filled` method should simply return the value of the `_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By returning the correct value from the `is_filled` method, the failing test should pass.
