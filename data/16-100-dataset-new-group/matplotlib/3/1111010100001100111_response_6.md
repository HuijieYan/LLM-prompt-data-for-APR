## Correction to the buggy function

The issue seems to be related to the `self._filled` variable not being correctly set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This causes the markers to not appear as hollow when they should.

To fix this, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. Specifically, when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` variable should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` variable will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the markers should appear as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the markers appear as expected when using `ax.scatter()` with custom `MarkerStyle` and setting `fillstyle` to `'none'.
