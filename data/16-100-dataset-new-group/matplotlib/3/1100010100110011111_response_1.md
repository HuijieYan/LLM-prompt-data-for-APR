## Correction

Based on the error message and the expected input/output values, it seems that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is not returning the expected value, indicating that the `_recache` method is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` method is overwriting the `_filled` attribute with the value `True` regardless of the input `fillstyle`. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False` for fillstyle `'none'`.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` method needs to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':  # Check the fillstyle and set _filled accordingly
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` method checks the fillstyle and sets the `_filled` attribute to `False` if the fillstyle is `'none'`, otherwise it sets it to `True`.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and also satisfy the expected input/output values.
