### Analysis
The `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided during initialization. This is causing the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.

### Identified potential error locations
The potential error location is the line where `_filled` attribute is being set.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is causing the marker to not be rendered correctly as "hollow" when `fillstyle='none'` is used, due to incorrect processing of the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided during initialization. This will ensure that the marker is rendered as "hollow" when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

### The corrected version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # the corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `fillstyle` parameter will be properly processed in the `_recache` function, and the marker will be rendered as "hollow" when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

This correction should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
