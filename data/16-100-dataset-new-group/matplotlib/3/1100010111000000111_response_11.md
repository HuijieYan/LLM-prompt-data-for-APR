## Analysis
The `_recache` method is meant to reset the marker style properties. However, the issue seems to be related to setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' not resulting in a hollow marker as expected.

## Identified Bug
The bug seems to be in the `_recache` method where it fails to correctly handle the `fillstyle` property, resulting in the marker not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

## Cause of the Bug
The `_recache` method sets the marker to be filled by default, and does not correctly handle the `fillstyle` property. This leads to the marker not being rendered as hollow even when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The fix involves updating the `_recache` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle` property, ensuring that it results in a hollow marker when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With the above correction, the `_recache` method now checks the `fillstyle` and sets the `_filled` property accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then the marker will be rendered as hollow. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the marker is rendered correctly when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
