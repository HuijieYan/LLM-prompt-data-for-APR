## Analysis
The error message is indicating that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This likely means that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly within the `_recache` function.

## Bug cause
The `_recache` function is not setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` as expected, which is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be `False`.

## Bug fix strategy
We need to ensure that the `_recache` function properly sets the `_filled` attribute to `False` when it is intended to be so.

## The corrected function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # updated to use float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._filled is None:  # added condition to check if _filled is None
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a condition to check if the `_filled` attribute is `None` and setting it to `True` in that case, we can ensure that it is properly initialized when the function is called. This should fix the bug.
