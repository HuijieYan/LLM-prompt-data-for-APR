## The analysis
The `_recache` function sets default values for various attributes of a MarkerStyle object and then calls a marker function. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking whether the `is_filled` method returns `False` after setting `fillstyle` to `'none'`. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which is unexpected.

The GitHub issue also confirms that setting `fillstyle='none'` is not resulting in hollow markers as expected.

## Potential error locations
The issue may be in the implementation of the `is_filled` method or in the marker functions that are called when `_recache` is called.

## Cause of the bug
The `is_filled` method is returning `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This suggests that the default marker function is not properly handling the 'none' `fillstyle`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the marker is treated as hollow. This can be done by modifying the default marker function to handle the 'none' `fillstyle` appropriately.

## The corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` of the MarkerStyle. The `is_filled` method will now return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` setting.

This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
