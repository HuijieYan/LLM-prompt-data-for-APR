### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the `_recache` function is related to the `_filled` attribute, as the failing test is asserting that the marker should not be filled when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. However, the buggy function always sets `_filled` to `True`.

### Explanation of the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function always setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified. This causes the marker to always be filled, even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to consider the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Consider the fillstyle when setting _filled
    self._marker_function()
```
