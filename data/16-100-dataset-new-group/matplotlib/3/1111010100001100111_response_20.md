### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not correctly setting the `fillstyle` of the marker to 'none'. When the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker should be hollow, but it is not being reflected in the output.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker is indeed hollow. This can be achieved by checking the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function and updating the `_filled` variable accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `fillstyle` parameter is checked, and the `_filled` variable is updated accordingly to ensure that the marker is hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
