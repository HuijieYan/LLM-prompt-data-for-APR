## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# this is the corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Corrected the value to set markers as hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

The bug in the original code is that it is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` input. This is contrary to the expected behavior, as in Case 1, it is expected that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the markers should be hollow.

By correcting the `_filled` attribute to `False`, we ensure that the markers will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none',` hence fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
