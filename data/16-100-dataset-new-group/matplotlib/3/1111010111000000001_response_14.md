## Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to update the markers based on a marker function, but there is a potential issue with calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This could result in a `NoneType` object error.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not checking if `self._marker_function` is `None` before calling it. This results in a `NoneType` object error when the function is called and leads to the test failure.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` exists before calling it. If it does not exist, we should return early from the function.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

The corrected version of the function checks if `self._marker_function` is `None` before calling it. This fix should resolve the bug and make the test pass.
