## The buggy function analysis
The _recache function is intended to reset various attributes to their default values and then call a marker_function. The failing test is checking the behavior of the is_filled method which is supposed to return True if the marker is filled and False if it's not filled. The failing test expects the marker to not be filled when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

## Potential error locations
The bug could be in the _recache function where it is failing to properly reset the values, specifically the _filled attribute.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the _recache function not properly resetting the _filled attribute when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This causes the is_filled method to return True when it should return False, leading to the failing test.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the _filled attribute is set to False.

## The corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if the fillstyle is 'none', and if so, set the _filled attribute to False. This will ensure that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the marker is not filled as expected. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
