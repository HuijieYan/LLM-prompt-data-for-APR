The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` unconditionally, regardless of the value of `fillstyle`. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, we should set `_filled` based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be `False`, otherwise it should be `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Change this line to set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, and the markers will be rendered as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

This change will address the issue reported on GitHub, where setting `fillstyle` to 'none' did not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.
