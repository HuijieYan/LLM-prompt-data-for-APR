## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for recalculating the marker style attributes. The failing test in the GitHub issue indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` after setting `fillstyle='none'`.

## Potential Error Location
The cause of the bug is likely within the `_recache` function where the `self._filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to `is_filled` method always returning `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function so that it respects the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it should remain `True`.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` parameter and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the bug can be fixed. This should address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
