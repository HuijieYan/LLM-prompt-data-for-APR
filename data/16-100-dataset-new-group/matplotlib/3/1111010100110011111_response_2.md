## The bug analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` is located within the `MarkerStyle` class in the file `lib/matplotlib/markers.py`.
2. The potential error location in the buggy function is the conditional check `if self._marker_function is None`. This appears to be incorrect as it should check for the presence of a valid marker function rather than checking for `None`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly assumes that if `self._marker_function` is not `None`, it should be called without any consideration of other attributes that may impact the marker's appearance. This results in the marker not being appropriately configured when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
4. A potential strategy to fix the bug is to re-implement the `_recache` function to properly handle various marker configurations, including `fillstyle`, before calling `self._marker_function`. This may involve setting the marker path and other relevant attributes based on the specified marker style and fill style.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            fill_style = self.get_fillstyle()
            self._path = self._transform.transform_path(self._marker_function()[0])
            
            if fill_style == 'none':
                self._filled = False
            else:
                self._filled = True
        else:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._filled = True
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if `self._marker_function` is not `None`. If it's not `None`, it proceeds to determine the fill style and appropriately update the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style. This ensures that the marker's fill style is correctly handled before calling `self._marker_function`.
