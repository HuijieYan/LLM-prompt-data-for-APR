The potential error location in the `_recache` function could be the `self._filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

The buggy function `_recache` does not properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter, resulting in markers not being hollow when expected.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute based on its value. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version of the function considers the `fillstyle` parameter and sets the `_filled` attribute based on its value, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
