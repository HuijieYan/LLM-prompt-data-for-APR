The bug seems to be in the `_recache` function within the `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` file. When the `self._marker_function()` is called within the function, it does not seem to properly update the attributes that are used by the `MarkerStyle` object.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object and expects it to return `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. However, the error message shows that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which indicates that the marker is being filled when it shouldn't be.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` function should properly update the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object when `self._marker_function()` is called. This might involve setting the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected function ensures that the `MarkerStyle` object behaves as expected.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
