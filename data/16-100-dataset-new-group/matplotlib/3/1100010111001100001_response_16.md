The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update the marker's internal state based on its parameters. However, the bug causes the function to not update the fill style properly, leading to failing tests.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the marker to always be filled, regardless of the actual fill style specified in the input parameters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly updating the fill style based on the input parameters, causing the marker to always be filled regardless of the specified fill style.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the fill style. We should modify the function to check the specified fill style and update the `_filled` variable accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function now properly updates the `_filled` variable based on the fill style specified in the input parameters, resolving the bug and causing the failing test to pass.
