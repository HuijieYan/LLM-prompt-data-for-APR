To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to update the `self._filled` variable to reflect the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then the marker should not be filled, so `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the marker's fill status reflects the expected behavior, and the failing test should pass with this corrected version of the function.
