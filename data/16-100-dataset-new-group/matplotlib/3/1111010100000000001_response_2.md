## The buggy function and its relationship with the class
The `_recache` function is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. This function is responsible for recalculating the marker style attributes based on the marker function. It resets the path, transform, and other attributes before calling the marker function.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the `_recache` function could be related to the usage of `self._marker_function()` without checking its availability or validity.

## Cause of the bug
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it's a valid function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is a valid function before calling it. If it's not a valid function, we should handle this case appropriately.

## The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # Corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
        else:
            # Handle the case when _marker_function is not callable
            pass  # or raise an error, log a message, etc.
```
