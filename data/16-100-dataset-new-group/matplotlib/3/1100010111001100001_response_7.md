The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be related to the `self._filled` variable not being set correctly. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the marker is filled or not, and it's failing because the `_filled` variable is being set to `True` inside the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` variable is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` variable will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass.
