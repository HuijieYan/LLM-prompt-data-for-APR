To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. Based on the provided runtime values and the GitHub issue, it seems that the `fillstyle` parameter is not being considered correctly when setting the marker style.

The bug is likely occurring because the `fillstyle` parameter is not being properly handled in the `_recache` function, leading to the markers not being displayed as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

We can fix this bug by updating the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the marker style. We can modify the function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and ensure that it correctly reflects the desired marker style.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we added a condition to check the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` variable accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then `_filled` is set to `False` to display the markers as hollow. Otherwise, `_filled` is set to `True` to display the markers as filled.

With this update, the markers should now be displayed as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
