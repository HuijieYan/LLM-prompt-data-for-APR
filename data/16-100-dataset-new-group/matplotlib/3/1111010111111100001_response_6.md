The bug in the `_recache()` function is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` instead of `False` as expected, leading to a failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` instead of the correct value based on the input parameters.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache()` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache()` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `is_filled()` method should correctly return `False` as expected, and the failing test should pass.
