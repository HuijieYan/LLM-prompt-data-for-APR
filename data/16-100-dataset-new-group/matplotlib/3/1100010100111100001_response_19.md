The buggy function `_recache` is called when the `MarkerStyle` object is created, and it is responsible for initializing certain attributes of the object. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

The bug is likely caused by the fact that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, regardless of the fillstyle. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we should update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

This updated function now checks the value of `self._fillstyle` and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This should fix the bug and make the `is_filled` method return the correct value based on the fillstyle.
