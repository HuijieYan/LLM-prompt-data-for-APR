To fix the bug in the _recache function, we need to modify the logic that sets the fillstyle attribute based on the input parameters. Currently, the function is setting _filled to True by default, which is incorrect behavior. 

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the _recache function now correctly sets the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub where setting fillstyle to 'none' was not resulting in hollow markers as expected.

The corrected version of the _recache function ensures that the fillstyle parameter is correctly respected, and the markers will appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The failing test should pass with this corrected implementation.
