The buggy function seems to be `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class in the file `lib/matplotlib/markers.py`. The function is intended to recache the marker style attributes, but it appears to be failing to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is meant to check if the `fillstyle` is being correctly set and if the marker is filled or not. The assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` is failing, indicating that the marker is being filled despite the `fillstyle` being set to 'none'.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' does not produce the expected result of hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Potential Error Location
The `_recache` function is likely not correctly updating the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, leading to the failure of the `is_filled` method.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug appears to be that the `_recache` function is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter, which is resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `_recache` function needs to be updated to correctly set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This likely involves incorporating the `fillstyle` into the logic for setting the `filled` attribute of the marker style.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
    
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

In the corrected version, the `_recache` function now sets the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and methods `get_fillstyle` and `is_filled` are provided to interact with the `fillstyle` and `filled` attributes. This should address the issue and make the failing test pass.
