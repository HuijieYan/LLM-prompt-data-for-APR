The potential error in the buggy function is with the `_marker_function()` call, which is not defined in the provided code. This could be the cause of the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the `_marker_function()` needs to be defined or removed from the `_recache()` function entirely, as it is not being used in the provided code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

By removing the call to `_marker_function()` and fixing the `if` condition inside the `_recache()` function, the bug should be resolved and the failing test should pass.
