## The bug in the function

The bug in the `_recache` function is that it directly calls `self._marker_function()` without checking whether `self._marker_function` is a valid callable object or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior if `self._marker_function` is not defined or if it is not a function.

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is a valid callable object before calling it. If it's not defined or not a function, we should handle this case appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # handle the case where self._marker_function is not defined or not a function
        # You can choose to raise an error or handle it in a different way based on your specific use case
        pass
```

With this fix, we first check if `self._marker_function` is a valid callable object using the `callable` function. If it is, we proceed with the remaining operations as before. If it's not a valid callable object, we can handle this case appropriately, based on our specific use case.

This fix will ensure that the function only calls `self._marker_function` if it is a valid callable object, preventing any unexpected behavior or errors.
