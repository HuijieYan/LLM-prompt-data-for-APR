The bug in the `_recache` function is that it always sets `self._filled` to `True`, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to take into account the value of `self._fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated line
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_recache` function now checks the value of `self._fillstyle` and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This will ensure that markers are correctly filled or hollow based on the value of the `fillstyle`.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the failing test pass.
