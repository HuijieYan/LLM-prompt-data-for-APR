The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly setting the `_filled` variable to `True`. This is causing the function to return incorrect values. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_filled` is set to `True` as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():


    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` variable will always be set to `True` as expected, and the function will return the correct values.
