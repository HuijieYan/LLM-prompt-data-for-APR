The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` regardless of the fillstyle in the `MarkerStyle` object, leading to incorrect behavior for the `is_filled` method.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle that is specified. If the fillstyle is 'none', then the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`, otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will now be set based on the specified fillstyle, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass as expected.
