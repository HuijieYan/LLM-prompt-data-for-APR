## Correction

The issue with the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, which is incorrect when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

To fix this, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this update, the `_filled` attribute will only be set to `True` if the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`.

This change will address the issue raised in the GitHub post, as it will ensure that setting the `fillstyle` to `'none' will result in hollow markers as expected.
