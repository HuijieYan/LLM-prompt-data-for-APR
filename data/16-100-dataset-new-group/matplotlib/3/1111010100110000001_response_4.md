The `is_filled` method is failing because the `_recache` function does not properly set the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should not. 

To fix the bug, we need to properly set the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle`, the bug should be fixed. Now, the `is_filled` method should return the correct value and the failing test should pass.
