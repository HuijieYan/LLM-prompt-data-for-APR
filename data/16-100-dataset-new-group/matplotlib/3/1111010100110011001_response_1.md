## The analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class. It is being called to recache the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object. However, in the failing test, the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This suggests that the `_recache` function is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute.

## Potential error locations
The potential error is likely in the assignment of the `_filled` attribute within the `_recache` function.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute to match the expected value.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly updated within the `_recache` function. This can be achieved by modifying the relevant section of the function to update `_filled` based on the input parameters or other relevant attributes.

## The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Updated to set snap_threshold to infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated to set filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that it reflects the expected value, thus fixing the bug.
