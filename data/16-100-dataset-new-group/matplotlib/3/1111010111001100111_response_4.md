Given the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the `MarkerStyle` class where the `_recache` function is not properly updating the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. As a result, the markers are not being properly set to hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and update the `self._filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to properly check the `fillstyle` and update the `self._filled` attribute accordingly, the bug should be fixed. This change ensures that when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers will be properly set to hollow.

This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub and should resolve the problem of markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.
