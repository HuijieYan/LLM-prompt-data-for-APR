The buggy function is supposed to recache some attributes based on the marker function, but it is not updating the fillstyle attribute.

It seems that the buggy function is failing to correctly handle the fillstyle attribute, as observed in the failing test where marker_style.get_fillstyle() returns 'none' and marker_style.is_filled() returns False.

To fix the bug, the _recache function needs to properly handle the fillstyle attribute and update it according to the marker function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the _filled attribute is updated based on the value of the _fillstyle attribute, which should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
