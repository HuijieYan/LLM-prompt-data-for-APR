The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to not pass. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` is returning `True` instead of `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is likely due to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` inside the `_recache` function.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `_filled` based on the value of `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the function should ensure that the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` passes and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
