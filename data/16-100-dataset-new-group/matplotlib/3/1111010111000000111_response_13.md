## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file. The issue reported on GitHub relates to setting markers to be hollow using the `fillstyle='none'` parameter, but the desired effect is not achieved. The failing test also demonstrates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` even when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue could be related to the implementation of the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. The logic of how the `fillstyle` parameter is being handled might be incorrect, resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `_recache` method. When `fillstyle='none'` is set, the method is not updating the `_filled` attribute correctly, which subsequently causes the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_recache` method needs to be updated to correctly handle the `fillstyle='none'` parameter. This may involve adjusting the logic of how the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that when `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are hollow as expected. This updated logic should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
