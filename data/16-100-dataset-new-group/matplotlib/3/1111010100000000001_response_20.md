The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class doesn't perform the correct operations and may lead to unintended behavior.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it's a callable object or not.
2. Incorrectly setting default values for several attributes.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where `self._marker_function` is `None` or not callable. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior when the function is called.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is callable before invoking it, and we should also correctly set default values for the attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
        else:
            # Handle the case where self._marker_function is not callable
            # You may want to raise an error or handle it in a different way
            pass
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is callable before invoking it. Additionally, we handle the case where `self._marker_function` is not callable.
