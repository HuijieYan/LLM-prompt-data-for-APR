The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` regardless of the actual fillstyle.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `_fillstyle` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `_fillstyle` attribute, the `is_filled` method will now correctly reflect the fillstyle, and the failing test should pass.
