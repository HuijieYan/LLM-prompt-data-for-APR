The issue is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, which is conflicting with the `fillstyle='none'` input parameter in the failing test. The failing test is expecting the marker to be hollow, but the default value of `_filled` is overriding this. 

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be set based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Adjust the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, allowing the marker to be hollow as expected. This change should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and ensure that the failing test passes.
