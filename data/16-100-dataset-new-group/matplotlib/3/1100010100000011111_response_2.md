To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to ensure that when `self._marker_function` is called, it updates the `_path` attribute with the appropriate marker path. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function does not correctly update the `_path` attribute based on the marker style, and it does not handle the case when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, we will modify the `_recache` function to check for the `fillstyle` parameter and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. We will also update the `_path` attribute based on the marker style.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    if self._marker.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._path = self._transform.transform_path_non_affine(self.get_path())
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will update the `_path` and `_filled` attributes based on the marker style and fillstyle, ensuring that the markers are hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
