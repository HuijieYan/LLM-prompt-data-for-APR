The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the `is_filled` method to return the incorrect value, which leads to a failing test. The `is_filled` method is checking the value of the `_filled` attribute, but the `_recache` function is setting it to `True` by default. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` instead of the expected `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` passed to the `MarkerStyle` class. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
