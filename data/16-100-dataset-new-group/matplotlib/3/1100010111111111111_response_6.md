## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    
    # Set the filled property based on the fillstyle
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
- The bug occurs because the `filled` property is being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle`.
- The `filled` property should be set based on the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then the marker should not be filled.
- By updating the `_recache` function to consider the `filled` property based on the `fillstyle`, the bug can be fixed.
- This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub where markers are not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none'.

The corrected version of the `_recache` function addresses the bug and should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
