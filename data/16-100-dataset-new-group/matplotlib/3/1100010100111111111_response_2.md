The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect when the fillstyle is 'none'. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` instead of `False` as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle. If the fillstyle is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, allowing the `is_filled` method to return the expected result.

This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub, where setting the fillstyle to 'none' did not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`. After applying this fix, the custom MarkerStyle with fillstyle 'none' should result in hollow markers as expected.
