The issue appears to be that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, even when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False` based on the input `fillstyle`.

To fix this, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of `fillstyle` when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

The corrected version of the `_recache` function is as follows:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected version of the _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle`, and the failing test should pass as expected.
