The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be related to the `self._filled` attribute not getting set correctly. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The `_recache` function sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect. It should take the value of the `fillstyle` attribute passed to the `MarkerStyle` class. This attribute is not being used in the current implementation of the `_recache` function.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to use the `fillstyle` attribute to determine the value of `self._filled` instead of setting it unconditionally to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, which should resolve the issue with the failing test.
