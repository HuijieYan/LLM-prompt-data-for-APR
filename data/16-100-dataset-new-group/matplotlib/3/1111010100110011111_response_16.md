The buggy function _recache() in the MarkerStyle class is not correctly reassigning the values for _path, _transform, _alt_path, _alt_transform, _snap_threshold, _joinstyle, _capstyle, and _filled. This leads to unexpected behavior when the is_filled() method is called, resulting in failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the _recache() function is not correctly setting the attributes of the MarkerStyle class. As a result, the is_filled() method returns the wrong value, leading to the failing test case.

To fix the bug, the _recache() function needs to properly set the attributes of the MarkerStyle class based on the marker function. This will ensure that the correct values are assigned and the is_filled() method returns the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache() function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = False if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none' else True
```

This corrected version of the _recache() function properly checks for the marker function and sets the attributes based on the fillstyle. Now, the failing test case should pass, and the MarkerStyle class will behave as expected when used with ax.scatter().
