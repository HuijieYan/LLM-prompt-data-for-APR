The root cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` is being called without checking if it exists. This can lead to a function call that does not exist, causing an error.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None` check, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it exists, avoiding potential errors.
