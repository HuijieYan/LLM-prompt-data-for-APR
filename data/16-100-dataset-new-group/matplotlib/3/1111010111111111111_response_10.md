The buggy function `_recache` is not updating the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This correction ensures that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is set to `False`, as expected. This fix will address the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it will resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.
