The bug in the `_recache` function is that it always sets `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. 

To fix this, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the markers will be filled only when `fillstyle` is not 'none', as expected. This fix will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.

The corrected version of the `_recache` function has been updated to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. This ensures that the markers are filled only when `fillstyle` is not 'none'.
