## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class, and it is responsible for re-caching the marker properties. The issue reported in GitHub indicates that when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'`, the markers are not appearing as hollow as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the `_recache` function could be related to how the `_marker_function()` is being called and how the `fillstyle` parameter is being handled.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` parameter. It seems that the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly interpreting or applying the `fillstyle` when creating the markers.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
A potential strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the `_recache` function properly handles the `fillstyle` parameter and applies it to the markers correctly.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self.marker = marker
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._recache()

    def _recache(self):
        if self.marker is None:
            return
        # Assume _empty_path and IdentityTransform are defined elsewhere
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True if self.fillstyle.lower() != 'none' else False
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `MarkerStyle` class is modified to take a `fillstyle` parameter in its constructor. The `_recache` function now correctly interprets the `fillstyle` and sets the `_filled` property based on the value of `fillstyle`.

By ensuring that the `_recache` function properly handles the `fillstyle` parameter, the bug related to markers not appearing as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'` should be resolved.
