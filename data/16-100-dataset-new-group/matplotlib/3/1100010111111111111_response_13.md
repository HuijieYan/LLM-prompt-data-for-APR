## Correction

The issue here is that the `_recache` function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior when the fill style is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to check the value of the `fillstyle` attribute and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of the `fillstyle` attribute, as expected.

This fix will address the failing test case and also resolve the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not displayed as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with `fillstyle='none'`.
