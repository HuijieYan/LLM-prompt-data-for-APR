The bug in the `_recache` function is that it checks if `self._marker_function` is `None` and then immediately calls it without any conditional checks. This means that even if `self._marker_function` is `None`, it will still attempt to call it, resulting in an error.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check before calling `self._marker_function` to ensure that it is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is not `None`, preventing the error that occurs when trying to call a `None` object.
