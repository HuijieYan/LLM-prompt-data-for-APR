The buggy function `_recache` is failing to reset the `_filled` attribute correctly, which is causing the `is_filled` method to return the wrong value. This is leading to the test failure.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly reset the `_filled` attribute within the `_recache` function so that it reflects the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` property, and the `is_filled` method should return the correct value after this change.
