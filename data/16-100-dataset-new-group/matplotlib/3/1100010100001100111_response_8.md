The bug in the function _recache is that it is not correctly handling the case when self._marker_function is None. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check to only call self._marker_function if it is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the _recache function will only call self._marker_function if it is not None, avoiding unexpected behavior when using markers with fillstyle set to 'none'.
