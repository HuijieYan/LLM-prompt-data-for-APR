The bug in the _recache function is causing the markers to not appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is evident from the failing test_marker_fillstyle test and the GitHub issue posted by a user who is experiencing the same issue when using ax.scatter() and setting markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none'.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the assignment of the _filled attribute. Setting _filled to True is conflicting with the expectation of having a hollow marker when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The cause of the bug is that even though the fillstyle is set to 'none', the _filled attribute is still set to True. This is conflicting with the expected behavior of having a hollow marker with fillstyle 'none'.

To fix the bug, the _filled attribute should be updated based on the fillstyle. If the fillstyle is set to 'none', _filled should be set to False so that the marker appears hollow.

Here is the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version of the function includes a condition to check the fillstyle, and based on that, it updates the _filled attribute accordingly. This change will ensure that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the marker appears hollow as expected.
