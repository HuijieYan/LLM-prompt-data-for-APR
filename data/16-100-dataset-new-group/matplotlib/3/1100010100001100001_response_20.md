The bug in the provided function is that it is always calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This can lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it exists, preventing potential errors.
