The issue is within the `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is failing with an assertion error. The failing test is checking if the marker style's `is_filled` method returns `False` after setting the fillstyle to 'none', but it is currently returning `True` instead.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the fillstyle set. This leads to the incorrect behavior when checking for the fillstyle.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to honor the fillstyle set and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, the corrected function will accurately reflect the fillstyle set, and the failing test should pass.

This correction resolves the issue posted on GitHub as well, where the user was unable to create hollow markers using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none'. With this correction, the user should be able to achieve the desired behavior.
