The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update the marker style attributes based on the current marker function. However, it is not doing so correctly, which is causing the failing test.

The bug seems to be in the line `self._marker_function()`, where the intention is to call the marker function to update the marker style attributes, but it is not defined properly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._marker_function` is defined and called correctly to update the marker style attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = self._marker_function._path
        self._transform = self._marker_function._transform
        self._alt_path = self._marker_function._alt_path
        self._alt_transform = self._marker_function._alt_transform
        self._snap_threshold = self._marker_function._snap_threshold
        self._joinstyle = self._marker_function._joinstyle
        self._capstyle = self._marker_function._capstyle
        self._filled = self._marker_function._filled
```

This corrected version checks if the `self._marker_function` is not None before attempting to update the marker style attributes. It then directly assigns the attributes from the `self._marker_function` to `self` if they exist, effectively updating the marker style attributes.

With this correction, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should now pass.
