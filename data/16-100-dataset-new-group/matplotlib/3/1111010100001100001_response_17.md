The bug in this function is that it is not handling the case where `self._marker_function` is None. This causes the function to return early without executing the necessary code to update the internal state of the MarkerStyle object.

To fix this bug:
1. We should check if `self._marker_function` is not None before attempting to call it.
2. If it is None, we should return after setting the default values for the internal state variables.
3. If it is not None, we should proceed with calling `self._marker_function()`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._marker_function()
```
