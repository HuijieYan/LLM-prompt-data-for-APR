## Fixing the buggy function

### Analysis:
The `_recache` function sets the default values for various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class. The bug appears to be related to the `self._marker_function` call at the end of the function.

### Potential error locations:
The potential error is likely related to the `self._marker_function` call, which may not be correctly setting the marker function.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the `self._marker_function()` call not setting the marker function as expected, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._marker_function` is being set correctly and is called with the appropriate parameters.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if marker function is available
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function(self)  # Pass the MarkerStyle instance as a parameter
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it. If it is available, we call the function and pass the `self` instance as a parameter.

This should ensure that the marker function is properly set and invoked, fixing the bug. After making this change, the provided test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass without any assertion errors.
