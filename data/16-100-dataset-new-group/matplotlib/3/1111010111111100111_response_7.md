## Correction

The cause of the bug is that the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is returning the opposite value of what is expected. This is due to the `_filled` attribute being wrongly set to `True` in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle`.

To fix the bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute to the appropriate value based on the `fillstyle` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class with the buggy `_recache` method fixed:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `is_filled()` method should return the expected value and the failing test should pass. This will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to setting markers as hollow.
