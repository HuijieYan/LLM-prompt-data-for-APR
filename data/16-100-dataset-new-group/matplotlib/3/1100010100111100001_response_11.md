The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be related to the `self._filled` variable not being set correctly. The failing test is checking the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is returning `True` instead of `False`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` input parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` input parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
This corrected version sets the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` input parameter, which should resolve the failing test.
