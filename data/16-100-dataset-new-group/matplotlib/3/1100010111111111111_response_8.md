## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Modified to set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function lies in the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter. The function always sets `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the fillstyle. To fix this bug, the corrected function sets `_filled` based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` is set to `False`, otherwise it is set to `True`.

This correction addresses the failing test and ensures that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the marker is displayed as hollow as expected.

By making this change, the corrected function ensures that the `marker_style.is_filled()` method returns the expected result and resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
