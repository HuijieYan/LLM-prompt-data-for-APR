## The buggy function analysis
1. The buggy function is within the MarkerStyle class and is named _recache.
2. The function sets several attributes of the MarkerStyle object and then calls a marker_function, which is assumed to be a method of the MarkerStyle object.
3. The expected input values are not explicitly given, but it can be inferred that the function relies on the marker_function attribute being set properly.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected, suggesting that the _filled attribute may not be getting set correctly.

## Potential error locations
1. The _filled attribute may not be getting set correctly.
2. It is possible that the marker_function is not being set correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the _filled attribute not being set correctly in the _recache function, leading to unexpected behavior when attempting to create hollow markers.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
It seems that the _filled attribute is being set to True by default, regardless of the fillstyle. It is necessary to ensure that the marker_function is being set correctly and that the _filled attribute is being updated based on the fillstyle parameter.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # changed to set snap_threshold to infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # update filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
