The buggy function `_recache` fails to correctly update the `_filled` variable to `False`, resulting in the `is_filled` method returning `True` when it should return `False`. This is causing the failing test case for marker fillstyle.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable to `False` in the `_recache` function. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Updated to set snap_threshold to infinity
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Updated to set filled to False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test case for marker fillstyle is expected to pass successfully. The corrected function now properly updates the `_filled` variable to `False`, which aligns with the expected behavior for the marker style. This resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread where markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none'.
