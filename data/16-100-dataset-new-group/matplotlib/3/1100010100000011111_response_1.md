The buggy function '_recache' is not properly setting up the markers. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting the marker style to 'none' does not produce the desired effect of hollow markers. This is likely due to the incorrect setting of the marker properties within the '_recache' function.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the marker properties and ensure that the markers are set up according to the specified style. We need to update the '_recache' function to correctly handle the marker properties based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._filled = False  # set filled to False for hollow markers
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'full':  # update based on fillstyle
        self._filled = True
    elif self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we check the fillstyle of the marker and update the _filled attribute accordingly. If the fillstyle is 'full', then the markers are filled, otherwise, if the fillstyle is 'none', the markers are hollow.

This correction ensures that the marker style, specifically the fillstyle, is properly handled and that the markers will appear as desired when using the scatter function with customized MarkerStyle.
