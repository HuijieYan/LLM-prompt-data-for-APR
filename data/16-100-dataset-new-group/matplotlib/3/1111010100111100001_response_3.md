The bug in the function `_recache` is causing the failing test. The function is expected to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, but it is currently setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally. This is evident from the failing test error message, which shows that `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `True` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we use the `get_fillstyle` method to determine whether the marker should be filled or not, and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
