To fix the bug in the _recache method of the MarkerStyle class, we need to ensure that the fill style is properly taken into consideration when setting the _filled attribute. The failing test is related to the fillstyle of the marker, and the GitHub issue also indicates a similar problem where setting the fillstyle to 'none' does not produce the expected hollow markers.

We can fix the bug by updating the _recache method to consider the fillstyle when setting the _filled attribute. If the fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache method:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _recache method to consider the fillstyle when setting the _filled attribute, the corrected version of the code should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
