The issue with the current implementation is that the `_marker_function` is being called without setting the `self._fillstyle`. As a result, the `is_filled` method returns `True` instead of `False`, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is called with the correct `fillstyle` value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value, resolving the failing test case.
