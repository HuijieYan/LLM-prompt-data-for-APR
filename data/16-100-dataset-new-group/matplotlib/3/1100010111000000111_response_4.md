## The bug

The `_recache` function is supposed to reset marker attributes to default values when called. However, the bug in the function is that it directly calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This bug is causing the markers to not appear as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' using the `markers.MarkerStyle` class.

## Fixing the bug

The bug can be fixed by adding a check to see if `self._marker_function` exists before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if marker function exists
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

This fix adds a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` exists before calling it, preventing unexpected behavior when it's not defined.

With this fix, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
