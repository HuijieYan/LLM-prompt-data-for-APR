## The potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The `self._marker_function()` is called without checking whether it exists or not, which may cause an error.

## The cause of the bug
The bug is caused because the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it exists or not. This leads to the failing test as it seems to be related to the `_filled` variable not being set correctly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it. If it does, then we should call it and update the other variables accordingly.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # check if _marker_function exists
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # update to infinity
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()  # call _marker_function if it exists
```
