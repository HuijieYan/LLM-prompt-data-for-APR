### Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to recompute the marker properties. The error message and the failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` after setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`. This indicates that the `_filled` property is not being updated correctly.

### Bug cause
The `_recache` function sets the `_filled` property to `True` unconditionally at the end, which is incorrect and causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` incorrectly.

### Proposed Fix
We need to update the `_filled` property based on the value of the `_fillstyle`. If the `_fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should remain `True`.

### The corrected version

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
