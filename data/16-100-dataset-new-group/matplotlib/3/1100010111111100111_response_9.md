The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` instead of `False`. This is leading to the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub where markers are not being displayed as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` within the `_recache` function, but it is not being appropriately updated when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be updated based on the value of `fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
