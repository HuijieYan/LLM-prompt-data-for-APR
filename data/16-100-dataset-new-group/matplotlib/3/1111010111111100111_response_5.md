### Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to recalculate the properties of the marker. However, the bug occurs when the `_filled` property is always set to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter of the `MarkerStyle` class. This results in the incorrect behavior of the `is_filled()` method, as seen in the failing test. 

### Bug Identification
The cause of the bug is in the `_recache` function, where the `_filled` property is always set to `True`, leading to the failure of the `is_filled()` method in the failing test. This is due to the missing logic to handle the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to incorporate logic to account for the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the `_filled` property. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`. This will ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct result.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` property will be updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that it reflects the desired behavior as per the failing test.
