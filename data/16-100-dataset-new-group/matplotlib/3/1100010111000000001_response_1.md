The buggy function `_recache` is not setting the `marker_function` properly, which is causing the failing test. The `marker_function` is not defined in the provided code, so it is unclear what it should be doing.

To fix the bug, we need to set the `marker_function` properly before calling it in the `_recache` function. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `marker_function` will be called only if it is defined and callable. Additionally, the `is_filled` method will return the correct value based on the `fillstyle`.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
