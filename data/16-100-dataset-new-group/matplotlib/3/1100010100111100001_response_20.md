The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` instead of `False` as expected in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, and the failing tests should now pass.
