## Analysis
The function `_recache` is intended to reset certain attributes to their default values. However, the issue seems to be with the line `self._marker_function()`. This line is calling a function without checking if it exists, which may result in an error.

## Bug
The bug is caused by the line `self._marker_function()` being called without checking if it exists. This will result in a `NoneType` object has no attribute error if `_marker_function` is not assigned a valid function.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we should check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

## The corrected version

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is not None
        self._marker_function()
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
```
