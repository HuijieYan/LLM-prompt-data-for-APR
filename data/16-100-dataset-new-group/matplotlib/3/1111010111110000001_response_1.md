The issue with the `MarkerStyle` class is that the `_marker_function` attribute is not being properly set before it is called in the `_recache` function. This is causing the `is_filled` method to fail in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` attribute is set correctly before calling it in the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function:
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it to avoid any errors. This will ensure that the failing test will pass since the `_marker_function` will be properly set by the time it is called in the `_recache` function.
