## Fixing the bug

The issue seems to be related to setting the `fillstyle` parameter to `'none'` using the `markers.MarkerStyle` class, but the markers are not appearing as hollow as expected.

Upon analyzing the code and the failing test, it seems that the `_recache` function is not handling the `fillstyle` parameter correctly. The `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, which contradicts the intention of making the markers hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function so that it correctly handles the `fillstyle` parameter and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

### Updated _recache function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`, we ensure that the markers will appear as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the markers appear as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()` with `fillstyle='none`.
