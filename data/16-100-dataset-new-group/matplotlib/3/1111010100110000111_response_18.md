## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to recalculate the marker's path and other properties. The failing test indicates that the method `is_filled` is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This suggests that the bug lies within the `_recache` function, particularly in how the `_filled` attribute is being set when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'. This leads to the incorrect behavior in the failing test, where the marker is expected to be hollow but is actually filled.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should update the `_recache` method to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
