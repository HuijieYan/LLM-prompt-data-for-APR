## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` does not properly check for the existence of the `_marker_function` before calling it. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is not returning the correct value, which suggests that the `_marker_function` is not being set or executed properly.

## Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_recache` function where the `_marker_function` is being called without proper validation.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` is not being set before it is called in the `_recache` function. This causes unexpected behavior when trying to determine if the marker is filled.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is properly set before calling it within the `_recache` function.

## The Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):  # Check if _marker_function is callable
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we add a check to ensure that the `_marker_function` is callable before it is executed. This prevents the error caused by calling a non-existent function and ensures that the marker is properly filled.
