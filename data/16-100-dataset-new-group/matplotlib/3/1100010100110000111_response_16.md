### Analysis:
The failing test is checking if the marker is filled or not by using the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The failure indicates that the marker is actually filled when it should not be, even though the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This aligns with the GitHub issue which also mentions that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers.

### Potential error locations:
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file seems to be resetting the marker properties, and this could be a potential location where the `fillstyle` is being incorrectly set. 

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not correctly handling the `fillstyle` property when updating the marker properties. It is likely that the `_marker_function()` is not taking the `fillstyle` into account.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the `_recache` function correctly sets the `fillstyle` property when updating the marker properties. This may involve modifying the `_marker_function()` to consider the `fillstyle`.

### Corrected version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._joinstyle != 'none'  # Assuming `_joinstyle` determines whether marker is filled
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` property is set based on the value of `_joinstyle`, assuming that `_joinstyle` determines whether the marker is filled. This is just an example and the actual implementation might depend on the internal logic of the `MarkerStyle` class. It's important to ensure that the `fillstyle` is correctly taken into account when updating the marker properties.
