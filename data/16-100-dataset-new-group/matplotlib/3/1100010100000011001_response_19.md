The buggy function is intended to reset several variables to default values and then call a marker function, but it has a bug that prevents it from working as expected.

The bug in the function is that it tries to call `self._marker_function` without checking if it exists. This could cause the function to throw a `TypeError` if `self._marker_function` is not defined.

To fix the bug, the function should check if `self._marker_function` exists before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # use float('inf') instead of inf
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

The corrected version of the function checks if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it. This ensures that the function will not try to call `self._marker_function` if it is not defined, thus avoiding a potential `TypeError` and allowing the function to work as expected. Additionally, I also used `float('inf')` instead of `inf` to ensure the correct type is used for `_snap_threshold`.
