## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`, causing the test to fail. This is related to the reported issue on GitHub where setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' does not result in hollow markers as expected.

## Error Location
The bug is likely located in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, so even if the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers are being filled as if it was set to a different value.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, update the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the markers are hollow.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function now correctly sets the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` of the marker, ensuring that setting `fillstyle` to 'none' will result in hollow markers as expected.
