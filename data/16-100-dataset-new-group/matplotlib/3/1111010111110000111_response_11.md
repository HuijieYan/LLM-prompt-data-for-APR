The bug in the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False` based on the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` is being called without checking the current fillstyle. This results in the marker always being filled, even if the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` when calling the `_marker_function`. We should only call the `_marker_function` if the fillstyle is not 'none'.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # Corrected version of the _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        if self.get_fillstyle() != 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is not 'none'
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version adds a check for the fillstyle before calling the `_marker_function`. If the fillstyle is not 'none', the `_marker_function` is called, and the marker will be filled. If the fillstyle is 'none', the `_marker_function` will not be called, and the marker will be hollow.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
