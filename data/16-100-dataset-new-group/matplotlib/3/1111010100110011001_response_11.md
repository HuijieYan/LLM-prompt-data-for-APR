### A potential bug location and its cause
The bug in the `_recache` function might be due to the `_marker_function` not being properly implemented or called. The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object and it is not returning the expected value.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is properly defined and called to set the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object correctly. 

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
