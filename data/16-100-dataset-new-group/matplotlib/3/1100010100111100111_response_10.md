### Explanation
The issue is related to the `is_filled()` method returning `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is because the `_recache` method sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes `is_filled()` to always return `True`, leading to the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` method to consider the value of `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Check fillstyle and set _filled accordingly
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `_recache` method now takes into account the `fillstyle` parameter and sets the `_filled` attribute correctly. This should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
