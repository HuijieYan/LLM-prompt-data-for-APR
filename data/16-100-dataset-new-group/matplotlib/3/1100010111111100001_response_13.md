The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not setting the `fillstyle` attribute when creating the marker style. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` instead of `False`, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to set the `fillstyle` attribute when creating a new marker style. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._fillstyle = 'none'  # Set the fillstyle attribute
    self._filled = False  # Set the filled attribute based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the failing test should pass, and the `is_filled` method should return `False` as expected.
