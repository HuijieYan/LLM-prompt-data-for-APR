### Explanation
The issue occurs because the `_filled` variable is being set to `True` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`, which leads to the markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` as in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy
We need to update the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to make the markers hollow.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
With this correction, the function will check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` will be set to `False`, making the markers hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
