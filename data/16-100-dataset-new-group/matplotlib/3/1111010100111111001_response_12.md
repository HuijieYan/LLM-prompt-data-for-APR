## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():


    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._filled  # Updated to set the filled property based on the value stored in _filled attribute
        self._marker_function()
```
By updating the assignment of the `_filled` property to `self._filled` in the `_recache` function, the corrected code ensures that the filled property matches the stored value in the `_filled` attribute. This addresses the issue in the original code where the filled property was always set to `True`, regardless of the stored value.
