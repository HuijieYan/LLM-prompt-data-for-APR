## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` file. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `fillstyle='none'` parameter is not working as expected when using `ax.scatter()`. This suggests that the bug is related to the fillstyle not being properly set in the `_recache` function.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the `_recache` function are the assignments of `self._filled = True` and `self._marker_function()`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter set by the user. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the user-specified fillstyle, and also ensure that the `_marker_function()` updates the marker style based on the fillstyle.

## Corrected Version

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False`. The `_marker_function()` is still called to update the marker style based on the fillstyle.
