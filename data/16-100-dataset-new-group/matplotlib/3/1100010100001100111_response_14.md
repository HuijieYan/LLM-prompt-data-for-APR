The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the case where the fillstyle is set to 'none', resulting in markers not being hollow as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the _recache function does not account for the fillstyle when setting up the marker properties.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _recache function to correctly handle the case where fillstyle is set to 'none' and ensure that the markers are properly rendered as hollow.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled to True if fillstyle is not 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the value of self._fillstyle and setting self._filled accordingly, we ensure that the markers are rendered as hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub, and the markers should now appear hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting markers.MarkerStyle's fillstyle to 'none'.
