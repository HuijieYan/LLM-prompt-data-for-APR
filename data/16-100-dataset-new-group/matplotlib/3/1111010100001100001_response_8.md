The issue with the current implementation is that the `_marker_function` is called without checking whether it exists or not. This can lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not defined or if it's not supposed to be called in certain cases.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it. Additionally, we should consider setting default values for `_snap_threshold` and other variables if needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = 0.1  # set a default value for _snap_threshold
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

This fix ensures that `_marker_function` is only called if it exists, which will prevent any potential errors related to a missing or incorrectly defined `_marker_function`. Additionally, we set a default value for `_snap_threshold` to avoid any issues related to an undefined value.
