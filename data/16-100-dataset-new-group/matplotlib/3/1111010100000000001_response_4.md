The potential error in the code is with the line `self._marker_function()`. It seems that `_marker_function` is being called as a method, but it is not defined within the `MarkerStyle` class.

The bug is caused because `_marker_function` is being called without being defined in the `MarkerStyle` class, leading to a "NoneType" object error due to the check `if self._marker_function is None:`. 

To fix the bug, the `_marker_function` needs to be defined within the `MarkerStyle` class and a valid function should be assigned to it. Then, the function needs to be called properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self):
        self._marker_function = None

    def set_marker_function(self, marker_function):
        self._marker_function = marker_function

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
