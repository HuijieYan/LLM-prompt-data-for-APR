The bug in the _recache function is causing the is_filled method to return True instead of False. This is evident from the error message, which shows that the is_filled method is returning True when it should be returning False. Additionally, the issue posted on GitHub confirms that setting the fillstyle to 'none' should result in hollow markers, but the current implementation is not achieving this.

The cause of the bug is that the _recache function is not correctly updating the _filled variable when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This causes the is_filled method to return True instead of False.

To fix this bug, we need to update the _recache function to correctly handle the case when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. We can do this by setting the _filled variable to False when the fillstyle is 'none'.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function now correctly updates the _filled variable based on the fillstyle, ensuring that the is_filled method returns the correct value. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
