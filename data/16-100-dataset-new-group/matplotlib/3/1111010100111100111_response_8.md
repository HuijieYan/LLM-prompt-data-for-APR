## Bug Fix

After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the MarkerStyle class, the corresponding error message, and the runtime input/output values, we have identified the potential error location within the buggy function.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function. This causes the `is_filled` function to return `True` instead of `False` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unconditional setting of `_filled` to `False` from the `_recache` function and instead set `_filled` based on the value of `fillstyle`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `is_filled` function should now correctly report whether the marker is filled or not based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
