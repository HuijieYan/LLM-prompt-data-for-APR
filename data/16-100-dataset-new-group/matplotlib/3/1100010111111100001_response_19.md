The issue in the `_recache` function is that the `is_filled` method is not being called correctly, leading to the failing test.

The buggy function `_recache` is not properly defining the `_marker_function` attribute, which is causing the failing test to raise an error. The `_marker_function` should be defined to call the appropriate method to set the filled property of the marker.

To fix the bug, define the `_marker_function` to call the method that sets the filled property of the marker.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_marker_function` will be called to properly set the filled property of the marker, and the failing test should pass.
