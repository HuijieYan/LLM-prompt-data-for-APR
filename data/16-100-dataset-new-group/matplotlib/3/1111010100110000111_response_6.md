## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, corresponding error message, the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for updating the marker style properties. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should not. The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute. It is always set to `True`, which contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class is always initialized to `True` and is not being updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to the `is_filled` method always returning `True`, even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified, resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. When `fillstyle='none'` is specified, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that the markers are correctly filled or hollow as per the specified `fillstyle`. This correction should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the `is_filled` method behave as expected.
