Based on the runtime and expected input/output values provided, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class has been identified.

The `while` loop in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function has an incorrect condition, which is causing it to incorrectly handle the calculation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect condition in the `while` loop:
```
while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
```

This condition removes elements from `self.previous_defs` until no element exists that satisfies the condition `>= depth`. However, it seems that the intention is not to remove all elements that are greater than or equal to `depth`, but only this one condition `self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth`.

To fix the bug, only the top of the stack (last element) `previous_defs` should be removed from the list if it is greater than or equal to `depth`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()  # Remove the last element
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This fix ensures that only the top element of `previous_defs` list is removed when greater than or equal to `depth`. All other conditions and logic remain unchanged as they are correct.

Applying this fix will address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
