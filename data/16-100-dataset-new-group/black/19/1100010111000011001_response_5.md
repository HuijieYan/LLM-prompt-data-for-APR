To fix the buggy function, we need to address the following issues:

1. The `min` function is used to calculate the value of `before` but the condition is not applied properly, leading to unexpected values.

2. The logic for determining the value of `newlines` is flawed, which is causing incorrect behavior under certain conditions.

3. The final return statement does not account for all relevant conditions, leading to incorrect output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (
            self.previous_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_decorator
        ):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version:
1. The condition for calculating the `before` variable has been adjusted to ensure it remains within the specified range.

2. The logic for determining the value of `newlines` has been updated to handle all relevant conditions.

3. All relevant return conditions have been updated to ensure the function provides the correct output for the given inputs.
