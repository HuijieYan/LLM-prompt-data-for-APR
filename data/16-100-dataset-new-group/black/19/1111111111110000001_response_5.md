The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could be that it's not handling the conditions and comparisons correctly, resulting in incorrect values being returned.

One potential error location is within the comparisons and conditions used throughout the function, especially in the `if` statements and the logic for determining the number of empty lines.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of different line types and conditions, leading to the wrong number of empty lines being returned, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle different line types and conditions more accurately, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines are returned based on the specific line and its relationship with the previous line.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if not current_line.leaves:
        before = 0
    else:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic and conditions to ensure that the correct number of empty lines are returned based on the specific line and its relationship with the previous line.
