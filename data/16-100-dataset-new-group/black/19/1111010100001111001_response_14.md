The bug in the given function is that the `newlines` variable is not being calculated correctly in all the if-elif blocks.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to make sure that `newlines` is calculated properly in all the if-elif blocks and is returned at the end of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                newlines = 0
                after_newlines = 0
            elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                newlines = 0
                after_newlines = 0
            else:
                newlines = 2
                if current_line.depth:
                    newlines -= 1
                after_newlines = 0
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            newlines = before
            after_newlines = 1
        elif (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            newlines = before or 1
            after_newlines = 0
        elif (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            newlines = before or 1
            after_newlines = 0
        else:
            newlines = before
            after_newlines = 0
            
        return newlines, after_newlines
```

In this corrected version, I've added a new variable `after_newlines` to capture the value for newlines after the current line. This makes the function more flexible and accurately computes the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
