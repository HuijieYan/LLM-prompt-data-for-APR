The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic to calculate the number of empty lines to insert is not implemented properly. It also incorrectly updates the `before` and `depth` variables during the calculations, leading to unexpected results.

Here's a summary of the issues identified:
1. The `before` variable is being incorrectly recalculated without taking into account the previously calculated value or the specific conditions for recalculation.
2. The `depth` variable is directly modified within a loop without proper consideration of the effects on subsequent calculations and return values.
3. The conditions for returning the values based on the input parameters are not being properly fulfilled and the flow of control is not being managed effectively.
4. The comparisons and conditional checks within the function are not accurately reflecting the logic required for the intended functionality.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Refactor the code to calculate the number of empty lines to insert based on better-defined conditions involving the input parameters and relevant state variables.
2. Separate the logic for depth-related calculations and handling of special cases involving decorators, imports, and yield statements into distinct conditional blocks to improve readability and prevent unintended interactions.
3. Ensure that the variables `before` and `depth` are updated correctly without conflicting with each other or producing unexpected results.
4. Refine the conditional checks and comparison statements to accurately capture the various cases that need to be handled for the correct functioning of the function.

With these considerations in mind, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to insert is rewritten to handle the input parameters and state variables properly. Additionally, the handling of different cases involving decorators, imports, and yield statements is made more specific and clear. The updated function should now pass the failing test.
