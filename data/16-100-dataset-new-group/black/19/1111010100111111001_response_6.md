Given the stated issues and the expected input/output values, the bug appears to stem from the `_maybe_empty_lines` method. 

As per the test cases, the expected output in each case needs to have the `before` and `newlines` variables properly set to ensure the expectations are met.

To fix this bug, the `before` and `newlines` variables need to be carefully adjusted based on the given parameter `current_line` and the previous line (if applicable). 

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines = 1
    elif ((self.previous_line.is_import or self.previous_line.is_yield) and 
          not current_line.is_import and not current_line.is_yield and
          current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        before = 1
        newlines = 0
    else:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            before = 1
        else:
            before = 0
        newlines = 0
    
    return before, newlines
``` 

This corrected version of the method serves to address the issues highlighted in the test cases.
