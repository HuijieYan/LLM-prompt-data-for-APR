The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic that determines when to insert empty lines before and after certain code blocks. The function takes a `current_line` as input and returns the number of newlines to be inserted before and after the current line.

Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables before the function's return, it seems that the logic is not correctly handling the conditions for inserting empty lines. In particular, the conditions related to decorators, imports, and flow control seem to be incorrect.

The bug seems to be primarily caused by incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines to insert based on certain code constructs and their relative positions.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing the logic for determining when to insert empty lines and ensuring that it correctly handles the specific code constructs (decorators, imports, etc.) and their relative positions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions and branches for determining the number of empty lines to insert have been re-evaluated and adjusted to address the issues identified in the failing test cases.

By reviewing the conditions for inserting empty lines and ensuring that they correctly handle the specific code constructs and their relative positions, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be fixed.
