The bug in the function seems to be due to incorrect determination of the value of `max_allowed`. 
The function contains a conditional statement which updates `max_allowed` to 2 if the `current_line.depth` is 0. However, in the cases provided, the value of `max_allowed` in expected values is also 2, which raises the question of whether `max_allowed` should always be 2.

Given the provided input/output values and the expected input/output values, the function does not appear to be incorrect in its logic. A suggested strategy for resolving the issue is to compare the expected results with the code and ensure the code logic aligns with the intended results.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1
        
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
