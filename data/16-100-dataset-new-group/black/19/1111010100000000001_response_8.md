The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class has several potential error locations. The function takes a `current_line` argument of type `Line` and returns a tuple of two integers. 

Some potential error locations within the function are:
1. The use of undeclared variables such as `Line`, `self.previous_defs`, and `self.previous_line`.
2. Incorrect indentation and lack of proper error handling for specific conditions.
3. The use of comparison and logical operators that might not yield the expected results.

The cause of the bug might be due to the improper handling of conditions and the use of undeclared variables within the function. 

The strategy for fixing the bug could include:
1. Defining the `Line` class and declaring related class variables (`previous_defs`, `previous_line`) within the `EmptyLineTracker` class if they are not declared elsewhere.
2. Ensuring proper conditional checks and indentation for each condition to handle different cases effectively and return the expected results.

Given the buggy function, here's the corrected version with assumptions about the `Line` class and required class variables.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# Assumed declaration of the Line class
@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: list
    prefix: str
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

# Corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
