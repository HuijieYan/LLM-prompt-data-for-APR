The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely related to how it handles the conditions for inserting empty lines. It seems to be using the previous line's properties to determine whether to insert empty lines, and there might be a logic issue related to this.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic for inserting empty lines based on the properties of the `current_line` and `previous_line`. The issue could also be related to how the function handles the `before` variable and possibly the conditions for different types of lines such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line, previous_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Logic for inserting empty lines based on the properties of current_line and previous_line
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if previous_line and previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if previous_line and previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function now takes `previous_line` as an additional parameter. The logic for inserting empty lines has been adjusted based on the properties of `current_line` and `previous_line`. The conditions for decorators, flow control, and imports have been revised to handle the insertion of empty lines correctly.

By taking into account the properties of both the current and previous lines, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
