Based on the buggy function and the expected input/output values, it appears that the bug occurs when assigning the value of `max_allowed` based on the condition `if current_line.depth == 0`. Additionally, the bug occurs when modifying the `before` variable through the `first_leaf` prefix and when updating the `depth` variable.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the conditions and variable assignments that are causing unexpected behavior. Specifically, the variable `max_allowed` should be correctly assigned based on the condition, the `before` variable should be updated properly based on the `first_leaf` prefix, and the `depth` variable should be maintained accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth <= 1:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    previous_defs = self.previous_defs.copy()
    while previous_defs and previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version of the function, the conditions for `max_allowed`, the update to the `before` variable, and the maintenance of the `depth` variable have been fixed to align with the expected input/output values.
