From some identified cases, it seems that the discrepancy arises from the calculation of the `before` variable in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function takes a `current_line` argument of type `Line` and modifies its attributes. It also uses the `previous_defs` attribute of the `EmptyLineTracker` class as well as the `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` attributes of the `current_line` parameter.

It could also be the case that the computation logic is incorrect for the expected behavior. The cases seem to cover various scenarios, such as the presence of comments, different types of lines (e.g., decorators, flow control), and different depth levels. This complexity suggests there might be an issue with the logic behind the `maybe_empty_lines()` function.

The `if-else` structure seems to be vulnerable to improperly handled edge cases. Additional debugging could help pinpoint exact fault locations in the function.

To address the issue, we can propose a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that takes into account the scenarios outlined above and includes proper handling of the input parameters and the logic for updating the `current_line` attributes. A simplified approach might be to use different methods for different scenarios (e.g., decorators, flow control) and separate the logic into smaller, more manageable functions.

Here's a potential corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Handle decorators
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        # (update attributes accordingly)
        return 0, 0
    
    # Handle flow control
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        # (update attributes accordingly)
        return 0, 1
    
    # Handle imports and yields
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        # (update attributes accordingly)
        return 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        # (update attributes accordingly)
        return 1, 0
    
    # Default case
    return 0, 0
```
This revised version uses a more concise and structured approach, with distinct blocks of logic for different scenarios. It separates the handling of different cases, making the function easier to understand and maintain. It's critical to include the exact updates to the attributes of `current_line` and the interplay with other class attributes based on the specific requirements of your application.

Please note that as the original context of the code is not fully available, this is a generalized fix that might require adjustments based on the complete context and the possible need for additional attributes or methods to handle specific cases.
