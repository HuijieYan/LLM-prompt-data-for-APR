The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely related to how it handles empty lines and prefixes for various line types such as decorators, imports, flow control, and yields. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is checking for correct formatting, but the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not handling prefixes and empty lines correctly, resulting in the incorrect output and the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function correctly handles the logic for adding empty lines and prefixes based on the type of line encountered. For example, it should handle decorators, imports, flow control, and yields properly to format the lines correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have refactored the condition-checks for `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `is_decorator` functions using appropriate helper functions. We have updated the condition-checks to ensure they are correctly handling different line types and prefixes, resulting in a corrected and more robust implementation of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
