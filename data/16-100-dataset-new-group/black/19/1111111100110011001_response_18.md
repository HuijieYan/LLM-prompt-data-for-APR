The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is related to the incorrect assignment of the variable `max_allowed`, the incorrect initializations and updates to the `self.previous_defs` list, and the mishandling of different types of lines.

The variable `max_allowed` should be assigned based on the condition `current_line.depth == 0` which should always be true.
The list `self.previous_defs` is being manipulated incorrectly. It should be updated when necessary, and it should store the depths of previous lines to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines.
The logic for handling different types of lines (decorators, flow control, imports, and yields) is incorrect, leading to the wrong number of empty lines being inserted.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made:
1. Ensure that `max_allowed` is always assigned with the correct value based on the condition `current_line.depth == 0`.
2. Update `self.previous_defs` correctly to handle the different types of lines.
3. Modify the logic for handling different types of lines to correctly count and return the number of empty lines to be inserted.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    # Update the previous_defs list based on the depth of the current line
    if current_line.depth < len(self.previous_defs):
        self.previous_defs = self.previous_defs[:current_line.depth]
    elif current_line.depth > len(self.previous_defs):
        self.previous_defs.extend([0] * (current_line.depth - len(self.previous_defs)))

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs[current_line.depth - 1] = 1  # Update previous_defs
        return 2 - current_line.depth, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, before), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, before), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

The above correction includes updating the `previous_defs` list based on the depth of the current line, and correctly handling the different types of lines to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted. This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output values.
