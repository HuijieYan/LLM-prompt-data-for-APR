### Bug Diagnosis:

The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It appears to be designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. However, there are various issues with the logic inside this function that are causing it to produce incorrect output, leading to test failures.

1. `before` variable is set to incorrect value:
   In the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the `before` value is incorrectly calculated. The calculation of extra newlines for `before` is not being done properly, leading to the incorrect value contributing to the final result.

2. Incorrect comparison for flow control and import:
   The conditions for flow control and import are constructed using incorrect comparisons and conditions, which result in wrong outcomes.

3. Incorrect usage of `depth` and `previous_defs` lists:
   The conditions where `depth` and `previous_defs` lists are being used to determine the need for inserting empty lines contain logic issues. They are not being handled accurately as intended.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:

1. Review the logic for calculating the extra newlines (`before` variable) and ensure it fits the expected behavior.
2. Correct the conditions for flow control and import comparisons.
3. Ensure proper usage of the `depth` and `previous_defs` lists.

### Corrected Version:

```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union

# Rest of the functions and class definitions remain unchanged.

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version includes fixes for the identified issues in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Now it should provide the expected behavior based on the conditions and correctly calculated extra newlines.
