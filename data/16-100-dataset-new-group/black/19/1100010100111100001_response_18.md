The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic controlling the insertion of empty lines. The function accepts a `current_line` and checks various conditions to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before the `current_line`.

In analyzing the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it seems that for certain cases, the function fails to correctly determine the number of empty lines to be inserted. This results in the `assertFormatEqual` comparison failing.

The main cause of the bug is related to the conditional checks inside the function, which are not taking into account all the necessary conditions when defining the number of empty lines to be inserted.

The strategy to fix the bug is to carefully analyze the conditional blocks in the function and ensure that they cover all cases correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (1 if current_line.depth else 0), 0
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (1 if current_line.depth else 0), 0
    else:
        max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
            return before, 0
        else:
            return 0, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with the conditional blocks, ensuring that all necessary cases are covered and the number of empty lines is determined correctly.
