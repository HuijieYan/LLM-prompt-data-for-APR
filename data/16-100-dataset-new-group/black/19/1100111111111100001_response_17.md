The behavior of the function `_maybe_empty_lines` suggests that it returns a tuple of integers, where the first value represents the number of empty lines to insert before the current line, and the second value represents the number of empty lines to insert after the current line.

The function seems to have issues with the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert before and after the given line. The input parameters and function return values in the runtime cases suggest that the issue may be with the conditions and calculations involving the `before` variable.

A potential cause of the bug may be related to the conditional logic used to determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. The incorrect values of `before` variable in case the `is_import` and `is_yield` conditions are satisfied might be leading to the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, one possible strategy is to revisit the conditional logic and variable updates inside the function, especially focusing on conditions related to `is_import` and `is_yield`, and make adjustments based on the expected outcomes.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions related to checking `is_import` and `is_yield` have been updated to better handle the scenarios that could lead to incorrect empty lines being inserted. Additionally, the update also addresses edge cases and ensures the accurate calculation of the `before` and empty line counts.
