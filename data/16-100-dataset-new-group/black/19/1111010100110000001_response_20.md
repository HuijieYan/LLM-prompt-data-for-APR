The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function takes a `current_line` as an argument and is expected to return a Tuple of two integers representing the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, resulting in an incorrect format in the failing test.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions and calculations for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

To fix the bug, the conditions and calculations for determining the number of empty lines need to be logically and accurately specified in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    else:
        before = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before += min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), before)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator and (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.depth:
        after = 1

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        after = 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, after
```

In the corrected version, the conditions and calculations have been redefined to accurately determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
