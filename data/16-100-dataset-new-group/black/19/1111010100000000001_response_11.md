Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- There are multiple conditional statements without proper indentation and grouping, which might lead to ambiguous logic and incorrect behavior.
- The use of variables such as `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line` without proper initialization or definition might result in errors.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the ambiguous logic and incorrect handling of conditions within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Additionally, the usage of `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line` without initialization can lead to unexpected behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Properly group and indent the conditional statements to ensure the correct execution flow.
2. Initialize the variables `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line` before using them to avoid errors.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
