The bug identified in the `EmptyLineTracker`'s `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to its handling of indentation depth and the number of empty lines to insert before and after lines of source code. The bug seems to be introduced by inconsistent logic flow and inadequate updates of object attributes during processing. 

In the given cases, the expected behavior is to correctly calculate the number of empty lines to insert before and after a given line of code based on its indentation level and other surrounding context. 

To fix the bug, it is essential to update the attributes of the `current_line` object correctly and consistently, and to associate the `max_allowed` variable and the `previous_defs` attribute properly with respect to the surrounding context. The conditions and logic control within the function need to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary to ensure the correct calculation of empty lines.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.lstrip("\n")
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function uses consistent logic flow and properly updates the attributes to correctly compute the number of empty lines to insert before and after the lines of source code based on the indentation level and the surrounding context.
