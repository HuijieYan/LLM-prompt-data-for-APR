### Bug Understanding
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is expected to return the number of empty lines to be inserted before the given `current_line`. It checks various conditions like if `current_line` is a decorator, definition, flow control, etc., and based on those conditions, it determines the number of empty lines to be inserted.

The bug seems to be causing incorrect behaviour as evidenced by the failing test. The test fails when it expects no empty lines before the first line in the file. Additionally, it also fails when it is expected to insert empty lines between comments within a decorator.

### Bug Analysis
After analyzing the input types and values, and the variables' values at the time of the function's return, we can see that the conditions for certain checks are causing unexpected behaviour.

1. The `max_allowed` value does not seem to be properly utilized for inserting or removing empty lines in some test cases.
2. Previous definition lines are not being handled accurately, leading to incorrect decisions about empty lines insertion.
3. The conditions related to decorators are not aligning with the expected behaviour.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Ensure that the `max_allowed` value is used consistently to control the number of empty lines inserted or removed.
2. Properly handle the logic related to previous definitions, ensuring that it accurately represents the state for inserting empty lines.
3. Review and update the conditions related to decorators to guarantee that empty lines are inserted or omitted correctly.

### The Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 0
        return max_allowed - newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the calculations for empty lines insertion and removal have been modified based on the identified issues. The logic for handling definition and decorators has been adjusted to align with the expected behaviour. This corrected version should address the identified bug and pass the previous failing test cases.
