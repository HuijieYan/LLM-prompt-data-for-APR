The bug seems to be caused by incorrect logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is expected to return two integers which represent the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

In analyzing the cases, we can see that the `before` variable is being overwritten by various conditions. This results in the incorrect output for the expected cases. Additionally, there is a condition that sets `newlines` to 2 without regard for the other conditions.

To fix this bug, the logic within the function needs to be thoroughly reviewed. The conditions for setting the `before` and `newlines` variables should be considered to ensure that the correct values are assigned based on the specific cases. The use of `before` and `newlines` should be independent of each other, and their values should be calculated based on the different conditions provided in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    for depth_value in self.previous_defs:
        if depth_value >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.remove(depth_value)
            before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
        
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
        
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions for setting `before` and `newlines` have been organized based on the specific requirements of the function. This revision should produce the expected output for all the provided cases.
