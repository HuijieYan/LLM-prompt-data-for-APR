The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` from the `EmptyLineTracker` class has been identified with the problems:

1. The logic inside the function is complex and difficult to follow, which makes it prone to errors.
2. There are incorrect conditional checks within the buggy function that are leading to incorrect newlines.
3. The actual requirements for the function are not clearly documented, and assumptions may have been made regarding its behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should be refactored to simplify the logic and improve readability. Additionally, the actual requirements for the function should be clarified.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    
    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    
    newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    
    return 0, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic is simplified for better readability and testability. The conditional checks are modified to correctly reflect the requirements for adding empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The actual behavior for each condition has been clearly indicated.
During the refactoring process, clarity in the requirement of each condition is critical in order to produce a reliable and readable function.
