## Bug Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to suffer from the following issues:
1. The first `if` block does not account for when the `current_line.depth` is 0.
2. The variable `newlines` is not always updated with the correct value.
3. The check for the `is_adjusted` flag is missing in the `if` block.
4. The logic for updating the `before` variable for decorators, defs, classes, and flow control is not aligning with the expected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the first `if` block to handle when `current_line.depth` is 0.
2. Update the variable `newlines` to correctly represent the number of newlines required.
3. Include a check for the `is_adjusted` flag in the relevant logic.
4. Revise the logic for updating the `before` variable to align with the expected behavior for decorators, defs, classes, and flow control.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_adjusted = False
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        is_adjusted = True
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if not is_adjusted:
        return before, 0
