The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple conditional statements, and it's unclear which code path should be followed for a given input. This can lead to incorrect variable assignments and return values, causing the function to fail the test cases.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional statements that determine the values of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines`, as well as the manipulation of `previous_defs` and `first_leaf.prefix`.

The cause of the bug is that the logic of the conditional statements and variable assignments is not handling all the possible cases correctly. This leads to incorrect return values and failure in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to re-evaluate the conditional statements and variable assignments to ensure that each case is handled correctly, and the expected values are returned based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have adjusted the conditional statements and variable assignments to ensure that the function handles all possible cases correctly and returns the expected values based on the input parameters. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
