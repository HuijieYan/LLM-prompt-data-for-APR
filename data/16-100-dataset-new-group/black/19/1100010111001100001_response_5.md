The buggy function contains a logic issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method. The issue seems to stem from the incorrect handling of `before` and `max_allowed` variables. When trying to consume the extra newlines in `first_leaf`, the logic doesn't properly align with the conditions for different code structures such as decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields.

The correct handling of `before` and `max_allowed` for different code structures is essential to ensure the correct number of empty lines before the current line.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Refactor the logic of handling `before` and `max_allowed` variables based on different code structures such as decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields.
2. Ensure that the logic is properly aligned with the conditions for different code structures to determine the correct number of empty lines before the current line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        return 1, 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the logic issues and pass the failing test cases.
