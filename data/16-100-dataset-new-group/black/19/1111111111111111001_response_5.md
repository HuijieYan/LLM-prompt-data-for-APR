The cause of the bug is that the function does not return the correct number of newlines in certain conditions. Specifically, in the case of a decorator block, the function should return newlines based on certain conditions. However, the wrong number of newlines is returned in some cases, leading to incorrect formatting.

To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the correct number of newlines is computed and returned based on the conditions specified for each case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 0
        if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 1
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```
This corrected version of the function should address the issues identified and ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the specified conditions for each case.
