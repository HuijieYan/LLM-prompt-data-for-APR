The root cause of the bug is that the first leaf's prefix is being set to an empty string, which affects the `before` value. The expected behavior is to compare the prefix count of newlines with the `max_allowed` value, but by setting the prefix to an empty string, this comparison is incorrect and results in a bug.

To fix the bug, you should avoid setting the prefix of the first leaf to an empty string, as this will lead to an inaccurate `before` value. Instead, the prefix should be left unchanged as the original prefix count should be compared with the `max_allowed` value.

Additionally, there is a conditional check missing for updating the `self.previous_defs` list when not a decorator. This might cause an issue in updating the previous definitions list based on `depth`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```
