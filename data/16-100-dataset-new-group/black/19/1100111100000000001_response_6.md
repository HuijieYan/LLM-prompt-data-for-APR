The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to the classes and functions it calls from the same file, such as `is_import`, `append`, `is_decorator`, `is_class`, `is_def`, `is_flow_control`, and `is_yield`.

One potential error location in the function could be the use of conditions and comparisons within the if-statements, as well as the handling of the previous line.

The cause of the bug could be the incorrect logic in determining the number of newlines to be returned based on the current line and the previous line's properties.

To fix the bug, we should review the conditions and comparisons used in the function and ensure that the logic accurately determines the number of newlines based on the requirements.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I've revised the conditions and comparisons to ensure that the logic for calculating the number of newlines is accurate based on the current and previous line's properties. Additionally, some of the conditions have been adjusted to better handle the cases mentioned in the original function.
