The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a function `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are several issues with the current implementation, such as:
1. Some variables, such as `newlines`, are not declared before being used.
2. The logic for setting and using `newlines` is unclear and could lead to incorrect results.
3. The conditional statements are not well-structured and may not cover all edge cases.

To fix these issues, the following steps can be taken:
1. Declare all variables before using them to prevent any NameError or UnboundLocalError.
2. Refactor the logic to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line to ensure correctness and consistency.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
