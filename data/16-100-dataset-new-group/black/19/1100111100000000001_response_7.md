To fix the bug, we need to address the following issues in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

1. There are multiple functions with the same name `is_import`, `append`. We need to ensure that these functions are correctly called as part of the class they belong to.
2. The use of `self.previous_defs` requires the previous definition to be checked and handled appropriately.
3. The conditional statements need to be evaluated and corrected to ensure they return the correct values based on the conditions.

To address these issues, we need to make the following changes:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def() or current_line.is_class():
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control():
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. Updated `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, `is_yield` to include the `()` to ensure that the appropriate function from the class is being called.
2. Adjusted the condition for `self.previous_line` to correctly check if it exists or not.
3. Made sure that `self.previous_defs` is handled appropriately within the `while` loop to update `before` as per the required logic.

By making these changes, the issue with calling the correct functions and conditional logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be resolved.
