Given the complex nature of the provided buggy function and the high level of specificity in the expected input and output values, fixing the bug requires a thorough understanding of the purpose of the function and the broader context in which it is used. It is crucial to ensure that the corrected function satisfies the expected input/output values across all test cases.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the algorithm has been updated to reflect the expected behavior based on the test cases provided. The max_allowed value is set based on the condition for the current_line.depth. The before calculation has been simplified and updated, and the handling for various conditions within the function has been adjusted accordingly. However, to ensure the code is correct, the function should be thoroughly tested with a full suite of input data.
