In the `maybe_empty_lines` function, in some cases when calculating line breaks and indents, the logic has some inconsistencies. This causes the actual output to differ from the expected output.

From the given test and the error message, it seems that the issue is due to extra newlines and incorrect prefix handling. The test is failing because the function is not producing the expected output. In the failing test, the expected output is compared to the actual output, and the test fails due to differences in the number of empty lines and the presence of unnecessary newlines.

To fix this bug:
1. Identify the logic errors in the `maybe_empty_lines` function contributing to the discrepancies in the output based on the differences observed in the runtime values and types of variables as per the failing tests.
2. Review and refactor the conditionals and assignments related to `before` and `newlines` in the `maybe_empty_lines` function in order to ensure accurate handling of empty lines and prefixes.
3. Ensure that the function follows the correct indentation and newline rules for different types of code blocks.

The corrected version of the `maybe_empty_lines` function is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if not self.previous_line or current_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line, between decorators or within decorators.
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or self.previous_line.depth != current_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the logical inconsistencies and produce the expected output while passing the failing test.
