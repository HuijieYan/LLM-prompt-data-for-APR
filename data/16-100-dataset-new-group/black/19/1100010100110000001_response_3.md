Looking at the error message, it seems that the bug might be related to the insertion of empty lines before and after decorators, which is not producing the expected output.

Based on this understanding, the potential error locations within the buggy function could be the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after decorators, as well as the logic for handling the indentation depth.

The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect logic for inserting empty lines before and after decorators, leading to unexpected output. 

To fix the bug, we need to review the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after decorators, and update the logic for handling the indentation depth based on the requirements specified in the error message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] < depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return before, 0

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue with inserting empty lines before and after decorators, ensuring that the output aligns with the expected result from the test case.
