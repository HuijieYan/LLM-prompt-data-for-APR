The bug is in the part of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function where it computes the number of newlines before the current line based on various conditions. It fails to account for decorators and the handling of beginning of file. When handling the presence of decorators, the function correctly tracks the depth of previous decorators but mistakenly fails to properly handle the previous line being None.

To fix the bug, we should add a check to return `0, 0` if the previous line is None, since we should not insert empty lines before the first line of the file. Additionally, the function should return `0, 0` if the current line is not a decorator.

Bug Fixed Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if not is_decorator or self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or if current line is not a decorator.
            return 0, 0
        if (
            self.previous_line.is_decorator
        ):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
```
