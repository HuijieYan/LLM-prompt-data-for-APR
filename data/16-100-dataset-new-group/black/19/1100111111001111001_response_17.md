The bug in the given function seems to be related to the value of the `newlines` variable not being properly considered in certain conditions, and the incorrect manipulation of `self.previous_defs` list. The `newlines` variable is expected to affect the function's return value, but it's not handled consistently in the code. The manipulation of `self.previous_defs` list also seems to be inconsistent and could lead to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should consider how the `newlines` variable should affect the function's return value based on different conditions. Furthermore, we need to ensure proper handling of the `self.previous_defs` list in all relevant cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            if depth not in self.previous_defs:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)  # Add current depth to previous_defs
            if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.depth == 0:
                # Don't insert empty lines in certain cases
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function, I have included more informative comments and made changes to the handling of `self.previous_defs` and the return values based on different conditions. The `self.previous_defs` list is now updated correctly within different conditions. The `newlines` variable is also consistently handled based on various cases before returning the output values.

The function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values for various possible input conditions.
