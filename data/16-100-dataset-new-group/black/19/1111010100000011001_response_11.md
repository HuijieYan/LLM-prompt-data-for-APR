The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the `before` variable is being updated incorrectly, causing the wrong value to be returned in some cases. The expected behavior of the function suggests that the `before` variable should only be updated in the absence of `first_leaf`, so a strategy to fix the bug is to make sure that the `before` variable is assigned the correct value based on the presence of `first_leaf`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        if not self.previous_defs:
            is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
            if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
                if not is_decorator:
                    self.previous_defs.append(depth)
                if self.previous_line is None:
                    # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                    return 0, 0
        
                if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                    # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                    return 0, 0
        
                newlines = 2
                if current_line.depth:
                    newlines -= 1
                return newlines, 0
        
            if current_line.is_flow_control:
                return before, 1
        
            if (
                self.previous_line
                and self.previous_line.is_import
                and not current_line.is_import
                and depth == self.previous_line.depth
            ):
                return (before or 1), 0
        
            if (
                self.previous_line
                and self.previous_line.is_yield
                and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
            ):
                return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function, `before` is assigned based on the presence of `first_leaf` and is not updated when the condition for `self.previous_defs` is met. This ensures that `before` contains the correct value for the return statement.
