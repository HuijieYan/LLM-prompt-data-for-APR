After analyzing the buggy function, its relationship with the class, test code, and the provided runtime input/output values, it is clear that the bug is occurring due to the incorrect calculation of the `newlines` value and the position of the return statement within the function. The current `newlines` calculation logic is flawed, leading to incorrect returns in some specific cases.

The buggy function logic focuses on determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line based on the state of the `current_line` and `self.previous_line`. There are several checks for different line types, depths, and previous line attributes that need to be evaluated correctly for the function to return the expected results.

To fix this bug, it's crucial to revisit the criteria for evaluating the number of empty lines required before and after the currently processed line. This involves closely examining the line type, depth, and previous line attributes to determine the correct `newlines` value. Additionally, ensure the return statement always returns the expected values based on the calculated `newlines` value.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function, taking into account the fix strategy:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
The corrected function revises the logic for calculating the `newlines` value and ensures that the return statements are positioned correctly to provide the expected results for different cases. This approach addresses the root cause of the bug and should make the function pass the failing test.
