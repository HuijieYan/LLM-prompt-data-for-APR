The issue with the function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears to be at the `if` conditions using the variables `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, and `current_line.is_class` to make decisions that don't seem to be correctly reflected in the test cases. The specific condition involving `is_decorator` is using incorrect logic for appending `depth` in `previous_defs` if it is not a decorator.

To fix the bug, use the following steps:
1. Update the `if is_decorator` block by separating the logic for decorators and other cases by removing the nested `if` statement and handling the case of a decorator separately.
2. Update the `if` conditions involving `is_import`, `is_yield`, and combinations of these conditions by evaluating the check for `self.previous_line` and the respective conditions using both `self.previous_line` and `self.current_line`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return (before or 1), 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
