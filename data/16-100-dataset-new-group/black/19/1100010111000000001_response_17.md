The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is supposed to handle various cases and return the number of empty lines to insert before the current line and after the previous line. However, there are potential error locations within the function that may cause it to fail the test. 

The potential cause of the bug could be the incorrect handling of certain conditions, such as `is_decorators`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. The function may not be returning the correct number of empty lines based on these conditions, causing the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for each condition in the function and ensure that it correctly returns the appropriate number of empty lines based on the conditions specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
This corrected version should address the potential error locations and fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. It provides proper handling for each condition and should pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
