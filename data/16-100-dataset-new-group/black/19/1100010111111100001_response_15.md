The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing the failing test. The issue is identified in the logic of the function when setting the appropriate number of empty lines before the current line. The function should consider the maximum allowed empty lines and the previous definitions.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the `before` variable, which should keep track of the number of empty lines before the current line. The function also erroneously overwrites `before` with a hardcoded value of `1` in the `while` loop, causing incorrect output for cases where there should be 2 empty lines.

To fix this bug, the `while` loop should correctly calculate the number of empty lines before the current line based on depth and previous definitions. Additionally, make sure that the `before` variable is not overwritten with a fixed value within the function.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This updated version should correctly handle the calculation of the number of empty lines before the current line and solve the bug causing the failing test.
