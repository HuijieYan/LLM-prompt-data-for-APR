The bug in the provided function seems to be related to how it handles the `before` value. The function is intended to calculate the number of empty lines and indents based on various conditions related to the current line and the previous line. The `before` value is calculated based on the condition, and it seems that it might not be set accurately in some test cases.

The issue could be due to a faulty update of the `before` value based on certain conditional branches, causing it to not reflect the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, ensure that the `before` value is appropriately set based on the conditional branches. Review and update the logic in the function for setting the `before` value so that it accurately represents the number of empty lines or indents required based on the conditions specified in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for setting the `before` value has been reviewed and updated to ensure accurate representation. After making these changes, re-run the failing test to verify that the corrected function passes the test.
