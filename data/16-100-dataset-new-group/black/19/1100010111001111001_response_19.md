The bug seems to be related to the logic inside the function `_maybe_empty_lines` and the conditions it uses to decide how many newlines to return. Based on the given inputs, the function is not correctly handling the conditions for when to insert empty lines before specific types of lines, such as decorators, yield statements, and imports. It is also not properly handling the onset of a new function definition. The use of `before` is inconsistent and may need to be adjusted.

To fix the bug, you can adjust the `if` statements and the conditions within the function `_maybe_empty_lines` to correctly handle the cases where the function is expected to insert empty lines.

Here's a corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        if first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") > max_allowed:
            first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.lstrip("\n")

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield and self.previous_line.depth != current_line.depth:
        return 0, 0

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

    # A new function definition, don't insert empty lines here
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0

    # No special cases, return the default before value, with no previous definition of empty lines
    return 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else max_allowed, 0
```

This modified version of the function should correctly handle the insertion of empty lines for various types of lines and appropriately handle the conditions where they are required to be inserted or not. This should resolve the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
