The current logic of the _maybe_empty_lines function appears to have multiple conditions to determine the amount of empty lines to insert, but the expected output for these conditions doesn't match the actual output observed in the failing tests. The conditions are not correctly updating the necessary variables such as `before`, `is_decorator`, and `newlines`. In some cases, `newlines` is expected to change to 2, but the current implementation doesn't guarantee this.

Based on the provided test cases and their runtime values, it seems that the only condition where 'newlines' should be equal to 2 is when `is_decorator` is equal to True and `self.previous_line` is None. Also, there is inconsistency in setting `before` and `newlines`. It seems like the expected behavior in setting `before` and `newlines` isn't matching the actual implementation.

A potential fix for this would be to refactor the function to clearly set the values of `before` and `newlines` at each of the conditional paths ensuring they are correctly set as per the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return newlines, newlines
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
            return newlines, newlines
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return newlines, newlines
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        return newlines, newlines
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        before = 1 if before else 1
        return (before, newlines)
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        before = 1 if before else 1
        return (before, newlines)
    else:
        return (before, newlines)
```

In the refactored function, the values of `before` and `newlines` are consistently and clearly set based on the different conditional paths.

This proposed implementation directly sets the values of `before` and `newlines` based on specific conditions, which should align with the expected behavior derived from the failing test cases. This refactoring aims to make the function clearer and more consistent in its output based on the input conditions.

Before integrating the corrected function, it should be thoroughly tested with the provided failing test cases to ensure that it now passes all of them.
