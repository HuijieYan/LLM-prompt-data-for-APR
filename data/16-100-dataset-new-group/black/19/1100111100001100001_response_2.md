Looking at the buggy function and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue lies in the logic used to determine the number of newlines to insert before the current line.

The function checks various conditions in the input line and the previous line and modifies the `before` variable accordingly. However, in some cases, the modification of the `before` variable might not align with the intended logic, leading to incorrect insertion of newlines.

One potential issue is the use of the `self.previous_defs` list to track the depth of previous lines. In some cases, this list might not be updated correctly or might not reflect the actual depth of previous lines, leading to incorrect calculations for the number of newlines to insert.

To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic used to determine the number of newlines to insert before the current line. Ensuring that the tracking of previous line depth and the conditions for inserting newlines are accurate will be crucial.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we have made adjustments to how the `before` variable is calculated and updated. We also revised the conditions for inserting newlines, ensuring that they align with the intended logic based on the input and previous lines.
