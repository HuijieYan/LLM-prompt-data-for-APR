The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing an assertion error in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test. It seems that the function is not handling empty lines and decorators correctly, as indicated by the error message.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the logic for handling decorators and empty lines. It seems that the function is not properly determining when to insert empty lines, especially in cases involving decorators and their comments.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling decorators and empty lines needs to be reviewed and updated to ensure that empty lines are inserted in the correct places and at the correct times, especially around decorators and comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    # Insert empty lines for comments
    if current_line.is_comment:
        return 2, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I've added a condition to handle comments and insert empty lines before and after them, so that they are formatted correctly.

This change should address the bug and ensure that the `test_comment_in_decorator` test passes without assertion errors.
