### Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is returning incorrect results, which is causing the `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail. The error message indicates that the expected and actual results are different, with extra empty lines in the actual result when compared to the expected result.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely occurring within the logic that handles empty lines and the calculation of newlines to be inserted.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is not accurately determining the number of empty lines to be inserted in certain scenarios, leading to extra empty lines being inserted.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The function needs to be refactored to accurately calculate the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the current line and the previous line. Careful consideration should be given to the conditions and logic flow to ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned in all cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = max(2 - current_line.depth, 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted has been adjusted to ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned in all cases. This version should pass the failing test.
