The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be related to the logic used to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function relies on several conditions and checks specific to different types of lines and the previous line.

Based on the provided failing test and runtime values, it seems that part of the buggy function is expecting some dynamic pattern of the line and whether it is a decorator, import, flow control, etc. However, the logic and if-else conditions in the function are not correctly capturing all the required scenarios and calculations to determine the correct number of empty lines needed.

To fix this bug, a strategy can be to review and revise the logic used in the function. This can involve redefining and structuring the logic using clearer conditions and branching based on all the context variables and scenarios that the function should handle.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    # Determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the current and previous lines
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    else:
        before = 0
        if self.previous_line:
            if current_line.is_import and not self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                before = 1
            elif self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
                before = 1
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions are simplified and restructured to cover all the possible scenarios and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the logic related to the current line and the previous line.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
