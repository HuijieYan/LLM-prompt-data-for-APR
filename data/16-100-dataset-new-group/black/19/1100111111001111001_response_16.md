Based on the provided information, the bug in the `maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be related to the handling of `is_decorator` condition, as well as the updating of `previous_defs` list. The expected behavior is to check whether the current line meets certain conditions and return appropriate values based on those conditions.

The bug seems to be occurring when checking the `is_decorator` condition, updating the `previous_defs` list, and not inserting empty lines where necessary.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `is_decorator` condition, handle the update of the `previous_defs` list properly, and ensure that empty lines are inserted based on the specified conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this corrected version, the `maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
