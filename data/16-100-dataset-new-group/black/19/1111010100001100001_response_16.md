Based on the runtime values and types of input parameters and variables right before the buggy function's return, it appears that the `-maybe_empty_lines` function is not returning the correct output based on the program logic and input values. The issue seems to be related to the computation of the number of potential empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The max_allowed variable does not seem to be computed correctly and may cause inconsistencies in the output.

A comprehensive strategy to fix this bug would involve reviewing the program logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensuring that it correctly computes the number of potential empty lines based on the current line, previous line, and other conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or self.previous_line.is_import):
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    else:
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        elif (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return before or 1, 0
        elif (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the function has been refactored to ensure that the logic flows correctly and returns the expected number of potential empty lines before and after the current line based on the input conditions.
