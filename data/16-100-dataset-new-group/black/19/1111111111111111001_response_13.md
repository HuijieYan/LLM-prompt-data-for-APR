The bug appears in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class in the `black.py` file. The function is not returning the expected output in several cases, which is leading to test failures. The expected output of the function in all cases should be:
- `max_allowed`: an integer representing the maximum number of empty lines allowed.
- `first_leaf`: the first leaf from the currently processed line.
- `before`: an integer representing the number of empty lines needed before the currently processed line.
- `depth`: an integer representing the depth of the currently processed line.
- `is_decorator`: a boolean indicating whether the currently processed line is a decorator.
- `newlines`: an integer representing the number of newlines to be inserted.
- `self.previous_defs`: a list representing the depths of the previous definitions.

Based on the given function and expected values, it looks like the function is not correctly determining the number of newlines and max_allowed values. The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect conditions inside the function or incorrect manipulation of variables. The function should be modified to ensure that it correctly calculates the number of newlines and max_allowed values.

To fix the bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be updated to accurately calculate and return the expected values for each of the input cases.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0] if current_line.leaves else None
    if first_leaf:
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.replace("\n", "")
    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - current_line.depth
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield:
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```
This updated function should now correctly calculate the number of newlines and max_allowed values, addressing the bugs identified in the original function.
