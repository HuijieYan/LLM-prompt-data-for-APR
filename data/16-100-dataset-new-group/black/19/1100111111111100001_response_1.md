The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to the incorrect reassignment of the `max_allowed` variable and the computation of `before` when certain conditions are met, particularly when `current_line.depth` equals 0. 

It appears that in the first set of runtime values provided, `before` is incorrectly assigned a value of 0 based on the condition `if current_line.depth == 0`. However, based on the expected functionality of the function as intended by the related test case, `before` should be assigned the value of `max_allowed` in this case.

The same issue arises in the second set of runtime values, where the value of `before` is once again incorrectly assigned as 0 instead of being assigned the value of `max_allowed`. This inconsistency is likely contributing to the failure of the related test.

Based on the given details, the suggested strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring correct reassignment of the `before` variable based on the value of `max_allowed` when `current_line.depth` equals 0.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = max_allowed
    
    # Remaining code...
```

In the corrected version, `before` is now properly assigned the value of `max_allowed` when `current_line.depth` is equal to 0. This should address the issue and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
