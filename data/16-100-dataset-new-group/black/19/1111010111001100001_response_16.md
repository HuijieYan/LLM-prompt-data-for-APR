#### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by incorrect logic surrounding the conditions for handling empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly computing the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on various conditions.

1. The logic for handling `before` and `depth` calculations is incorrect in some cases.
2. The logic for handling the insertion of empty lines before and after the current line based on specific conditions is also incorrect, leading to incorrect return values.

#### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the logic for handling `before` and `depth` calculations should be corrected, and the logic for inserting empty lines based on specific conditions should also be corrected. It is important to ensure that the correct conditions are used to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

#### Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```
I have corrected the inaccuracy in how the `before` value is being computed, and also adjusted the logic for inserting empty lines based on specific conditions.
