The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic is not correctly handling the cases for different line types and the conditions involving `current_line`. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the function to properly evaluate the current line type and conditions. Specifically, the function should consider different line types such as decorators, `def`, `class`, flow control, and imports, and use them to determine the number of empty lines to insert.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return 2, 0
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line:  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file
            return 0, 0
        return 2, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    else:
        return 0, 0  # Default case, no empty lines
```

In this corrected version, we use separate `if-elif` conditions to handle different types of lines and enforce the logic based on each line type.

With this correction, the function should properly determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line based on different line types and conditions. This should address the bug by ensuring the correct number of empty lines is produced in each case.
