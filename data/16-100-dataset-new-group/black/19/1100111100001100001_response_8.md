The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be caused by incorrect assignment to the `before` variable and inconsistencies in the use of the `depth` and `is_decorator` flags. The function is expected to return a tuple in the format (int, int), representing the number of newlines before and after the current line.

The following steps can be taken to fix the bug:

1. Adjust the calculation of the `before` value to correctly handle the conditions for inserting newlines.

2. Ensure that the `depth` and `is_decorator` flags are used consistently to determine the number of newlines to be returned.

3. Address the cases where the previous line is an import or a yield statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the `before` value is determined using the `min` function to handle the `current_line.depth` condition correctly. Additionally, the conditions involving `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` are organized to ensure consistent and correct handling of the different scenarios.

This corrected function should now return the expected number of newlines before and after the current line based on the specified conditions.
