The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it does not properly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function doesn't return the expected output due to incorrect logic in some parts of the implementation. The process mediated by the conditional statements need to be closely reviewed.

To fix the bug, I would recommend re-implementing the function to consider various cases in the input lines and leaves to determine the correct number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the line. The implementation should follow the logic specified in the function's description.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    # Counter for the number of empty lines needed before the currently processed line
    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    # Implementation specific to the 'depth' and 'previous_defs'
    for depth in reversed(self.previous_defs):
        if depth >= current_line.depth:
            before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2
            self.previous_defs.pop() 

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        # Additional conditions specific to decorators, defs, and classes
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 1
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines += 1
            return newlines, 0

    # The remaining cases specific to flow control, imports, and yield handling
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected implementation now includes proper handling of different cases for the input line and leaves, aligning with the expected functionality.

Be sure to use the corrected function in your application to replace the buggy behavior. After updating the code with this corrected function, the failing test cases should produce the expected output.
