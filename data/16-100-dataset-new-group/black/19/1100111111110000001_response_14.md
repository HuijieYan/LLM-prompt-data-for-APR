The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to incorrectly handle the situation of the previous line being a decorator. The failing test seems to have comments in a decorator that are not handled correctly by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. When a line is a decorator, the function should not insert any empty lines.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly handle the case of a previous line being a decorator.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines before/after a decorator.
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version, when `current_line` is a decorator, the function immediately returns 0, 0, indicating that no empty lines should be inserted. This should address the issue in the failing test.
