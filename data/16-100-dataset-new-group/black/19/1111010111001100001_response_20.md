The function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class appears to have several issues that are causing it to fail the test. The function contains multiple conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions.

Some of the potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The logic to calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is complex and depends on multiple conditions.
2. The use of mutable self.state in the function can lead to unexpected behavior.

An explanation of the cause of the bug can be derived from analyzing the runtime input/output variable values. In each of the analyzed cases, the max_allowed variable is being explicitly set to either 1 or 2, but it is not being used correctly in the subsequent logic. Additionally, the process of modifying the prefix of the first leaf could potentially be causing issues with maintaining consistent state.

Based on the analysis, a strategy for fixing the bug would be to simplify the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. Additionally, avoiding the use of mutable state could help to improve the predictability of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        before = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return before, after
    elif current_line.is_decorator:
        return before, after
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        after = 1
        return before, after
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        before = 1
        return before, after
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        before = 1
        return before, after
    return before, after
```

This fixed version simplifies the logic by categorizing the cases based on the type of the current line and then directly computing the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the conditions. This should provide a more predictable and maintainable behavior for the function.
