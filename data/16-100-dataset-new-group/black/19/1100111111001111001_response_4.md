There are several potential issues with the _maybe_empty_lines function that could be leading to the failing test. Here are the potential issues:

1. The condition `if current_line.depth == 0` on line 5 checks for the depth of the current line. However, there's no control flow to update the `max_allowed` variable if the depth is other than 0. This could be problematic if the depth should be recovered from `Line` object but not in the current implementation.
2. There is inconsistent usage of `self` and `current_line` objects. It's possible that the incorrect property might be accessed from the wrong object. 
3. The logic inside the while loop might not be correctly popping the `self.previous_defs` list and updating the `before` value accordingly. The conditions inside the loop should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the correct handling is being performed.

A strategy for fixing the bug could include reviewing the control flow of the function and ensuring that all the conditions are being properly handled.

Here's the corrected version incorporating the potential issues mentioned:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth == 0:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected implementation addresses the potential issues highlighted and ensures that the function behaves as expected.

Please test the code to confirm if the corrected implementation resolves the failing test cases.
