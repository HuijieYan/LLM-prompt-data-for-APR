The potential bug in the function is that the logic could be incorrect for calculating the number of before lines to be returned for different types of lines and scenarios.

The expected output values and types for each test case indicate that the `max_allowed`, `before`, `first_leaf`, `depth`, and `is_decorator` variables need to be updated and handled differently based on the input parameters.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the logic that calculates the values for the before lines based on different conditions. There should be separate handling for different types of lines such as decorators, def, class, flow control, import, and yield lines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
        else:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions for decorators, def, class, and special cases such as import and yield lines have been handled appropriately based on the test cases. This should fix the buggy behavior and ensure that the function passes the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output values.
