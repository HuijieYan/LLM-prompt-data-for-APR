Based on the failing test cases, it's evident that the _maybe_empty_lines function is not returning the expected results. The function is used to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. We need to ensure that the function returns the correct number of empty lines based on various conditions as specified in the failing test cases.

The failing test cases include scenarios where the following information is passed to the _maybe_empty_lines function:
- The depth of the current line
- The leaves in the current line
- The previous_defs list
- Information about the previous line, such as whether it was a decorator, def, or import, its depth, etc.

The expected outcomes for the test cases point to inconsistencies in the actual return values of the _maybe_empty_lines function, highlighting cases where the function fails to return the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line.

Based on the analysis, we can observe that the function's logic is quite complex and dependent on various conditions. To address the issue, we may need to review the logic within the function to ensure that it accurately covers all the edge cases and returns the correct number of empty lines based on the input parameters.

Here is a corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function based on the analysis:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        before = 0  # Initialize the count of lines before the current line
        after = 0   # Initialize the count of lines after the current line
        
        # Logic to determine the number of empty lines based on the current line
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            before = 1
            if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
                before = 2
            else:
                before = 1
        
        # Additional logic based on the type of the current line (e.g., decorator, def, import, etc.)
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line is None:
                after = 0  # No empty lines after the first line in the file
            elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                after = 0  # No empty lines between decorators
            else:
                after = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1
        
        # Additional conditions
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            before = 0
            after = 1
        elif (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            before = 1  # Adjust the number of empty lines based on the import conditions
        elif (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            before = 1  # Adjust the number of empty lines based on the yield conditions
        
        return before, after
```

In the corrected version, I reviewed the logic within the _maybe_empty_lines function and adjusted it based on the expected behavior specified in the failing test cases. Additional checks and conditions were added to ensure that the function accurately returns the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line.

This corrected version should address the issues and pass the failing test cases.
