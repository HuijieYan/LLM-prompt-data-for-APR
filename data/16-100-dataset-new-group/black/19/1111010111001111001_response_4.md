The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class is that it incorrectly handles the `before` variable when there are no previous definitions at the same depth. 

The bug occurs when there is no previous definition at the same depth, so it should set `before` to 1 if `depth` is truthy (i.e. not 0) and to 2 if `depth` is 0. However, the code fails to account for this condition, leading to incorrect outputs in these cases.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the code that handles the `before` variable based on the condition where there are no previous definitions at the same depth. Additionally, a check for `depth` being truthy or not is done to appropriately set the value of `before`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Corrected _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if not self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

        if not self.previous_defs:
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should handle the `before` variable correctly even when there are no previous definitions at the same depth.
