## Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function takes a `current_line` as an input and returns a tuple of integers. It calculates the number of empty lines that can be inserted before the `current_line` based on certain conditions. The function seems to have multiple conditional checks based on the type of `current_line` and the preceding line.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Assigning `before` multiple times without using it.
2. Incorrect logic for calculating the number of empty lines to be inserted.
3. Conditional checks that may not be accurately identifying the type of `current_line` or the previous line.

## Bug Cause
The bug might be caused by incorrect logic when determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the `current_line`. This could be due to inaccurate conditional checks and inconsistent handling of the `before` variable.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Review and update the conditional checks to accurately identify the type of `current_line` and the previous line.
2. Refactor the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to be inserted before the `current_line` to ensure consistent and accurate results.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - current_line.depth if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

After making these changes, the function should be able to accurately determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before the `current_line`. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
