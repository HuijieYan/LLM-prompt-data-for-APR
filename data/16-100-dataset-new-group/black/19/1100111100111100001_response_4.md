The bug in the provided function seems to be due to incorrect handling of the indentation depth and newline count. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions. However, there are multiple issues with how the function handles the indentation depth, previous lines, and specific line types.

The strategy to fix the bug is as follows:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the cases for decorators, imports, yields, flow control, and class definitions.
2. Ensure that the logic for handling indentation depth and previous lines is accurate.
3. Fix the conditions and returns to align with the expected behavior for empty line insertions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    # Check if the current line is a decorator, def, class, or flow control
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_def = current_line.is_def
    is_class = current_line.is_class
    is_flow_control = current_line.is_flow_control
    is_import = current_line.is_import
    is_yield = current_line.is_yield

    if is_decorator or is_def or is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
            return newlines, 0

    if is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should fix the issues with the original function and align its behavior with the expected logic.
