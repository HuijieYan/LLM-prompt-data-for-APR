Based on the error message, the failing test is related to formatting issues within the `maybe_empty_lines()` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is responsible for returning the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. This indicates that the issue lies in the logic of handling empty lines in the source code.

It appears that the `maybe_empty_lines()` function is incorrectly handling the insertion of empty lines before and after the lines in the source code, leading to the formatting mismatch between the expected and actual results.

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of empty lines, misinterpretation of the logic for inserting empty lines, and potential issues with identifying imports, decorators, classes, and flow control statements.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the logic for identifying and handling empty lines, imports, decorators, classes, and flow control statements. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function properly accounts for the insertion of empty lines before and after the lines in the source code, based on the defined logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `maybe_empty_lines()` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        depth = sum(1 for _ in filter(lambda leaf: leaf.prefix.endswith("\n"), current_line.leaves))
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This correction includes a more accurate calculation of `before` and `depth`, proper handling of empty lines, and correct identification of decorators, classes, and flow control statements. It aims to ensure that the function behaves as per the intended logic, addressing the formatting mismatch issue.
