The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method is related to the `newlines` and `is_decorator` variables being assigned incorrect values based on the conditionals. The logic is complex with several nested conditional statements which makes it difficult to follow and debug.

The potential error locations are:
1. The conditional statements that assign values to `newlines` and `before` variables.
2. Incorrect calculation and assignment of `newlines` and `before` variables.
3. Incorrect manipulation of `first_leaf.prefix` value.

The cause of the bug is due to incorrect handling of the conditional statements which assigns values to the `newlines` and `before` variables which results in inconsistent and unexpected outputs.

To fix the bug, we should simplify the logic and conditional statements. We can also separate the conditional logic into different cases to handle each case separately, thus reducing complexity and chance of errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""  # this line must be executed for both cases
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0  # don't insert empty lines between decorators
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0  # don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0  # don't insert empty lines between decorators
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version changes the conditional statements and simplifies the logic. By separating the cases of handling different conditionals, the function becomes more readable and the chance of error is reduced.
