The bug in the _maybe_empty_lines function results in incorrect handling of empty lines when certain conditions are met. The function is intended to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line, based on various criteria such as the depth of the current line, the presence of leaves, and the type of the current line (e.g., decorator, def, class, flow control, import).

One potential error location is the logic for setting the value of 'before' where it is updated multiple times based on different conditions. This can lead to incorrect values being assigned to 'before' when multiple conditions are met.

Another potential error location is the conditional statements that handle different types of lines (decorator, def, class, flow control, import). The logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted in each case may be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the logic for setting the value of 'before' and determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line should be revised to ensure correct handling of different conditions. Additionally, the conditional statements for different line types should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned in each case.

Here's the corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and 
        current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

After applying the above corrections, the _maybe_empty_lines function should pass the failing test.
