The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises as it does not correctly handle the conditions for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. This has led to the failing test case, specifically the `test_comment_in_decorator` test.

In the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, there are multiple condition checks and logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on various attributes of the line. The reason for the failing test is due to incorrect computations in the logic, resulting in an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual values.

To fix this bug, it is important to review and update the logic of determining the number of empty lines based on the line attributes. Correct handling of conditions and initialization of variables, especially `max_allowed` and `self.previous_defs`, should be implemented to ensure the accurate computation of before and after empty lines.

Based on the analysis, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function addresses the incorrect computations and conditions, aiming to accurately determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

It should be noted that further testing and validation is required to ensure the comprehensive correctness of the corrected function.
