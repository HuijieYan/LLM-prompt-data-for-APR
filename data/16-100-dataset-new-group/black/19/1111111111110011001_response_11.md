The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` contains several issues. The critical problems are related to the handling of indentation depth, tracking of the previous line, and the flow control conditions.

To fix the bug:
1. It is crucial to determine the correct max_allowed value based on the code context.
2. Properly track the previous line and elements to determine whether to insert empty lines.
3. Address the issues with is_decorator, along with other conditions that impact the decision to insert empty lines.

Below is the fixed version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the newlines of the first leaf's prefix.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
