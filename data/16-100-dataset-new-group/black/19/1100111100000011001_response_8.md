The bug in the provided function seems to stem from incorrect logic and the handling of function parameters. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the necessary number of empty lines before a given current line. The function has a series of conditional checks where specific values are modified based on certain conditions.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional logic and ensure that the function parameters are handled correctly to produce the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    
    # Perform checks for different line conditions
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    # Check if line is a decorator, def, or class
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    # Check for flow control
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Check for import and yield conditions
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have:

1. Modified how `max_allowed` is assigned based on the condition `current_line.depth > 0`.
2. Changed the logical flow for handling different line conditions. This includes setting `newlines` based on different depths and using conditional checks for import and yield conditions.
3. Addressed the handling of different cases for setting `before` and returning the expected tuple of integers.

The corrected function should now provide the expected output based on the cases provided.
