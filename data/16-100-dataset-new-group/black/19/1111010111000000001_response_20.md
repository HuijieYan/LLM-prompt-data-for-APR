Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, and it is designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

Potential error locations:
1. The variable `depth` is being used without being initialized.
2. The `while` loop condition involving `self.previous_defs` seems to be causing an issue.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of the `depth` variable and the `while` loop logic. When the function tries to access `depth` without initializing it, it can lead to unexpected behavior, and the `while` loop condition also seems to have an issue.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize the `depth` variable in the function before using it.
2. Review and modify the `while` loop condition to ensure it behaves as intended.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    depth = current_line.depth  # Initializing the depth variable
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
This corrected version initializes the `depth` variable and revises the `while` loop condition to correctly handle the `previous_defs` list.
