## Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function defines rules for inserting empty lines in the formatted code. In this case, the failing test is related to an issue with inserting the correct number of empty lines in the formatted code.

### Error Location
The bug might be located in the logic for inserting empty lines based on specific line types (e.g., decorators, flow control, imports, etc).

### Cause of the Bug
The failing test indicates that the number of empty lines inserted is incorrect. This points to the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on certain conditions. The error message reflects a situation where the number of empty lines inserted does not match the expected output, and this could be due to logic errors within the function.

### Fix Strategy
1. Review the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, focusing on the conditions for inserting empty lines based on different line types.
2. Check for any missing or incorrect conditions that might result in the wrong number of empty lines inserted.
3. Ensure that the logic correctly identifies the line type and depth to determine the appropriate number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix
The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not self.is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not self.is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for identifying import and yield lines have been updated to call the corresponding functions instead of directly accessing the attributes, which were found to be associated with separate functions. This ensures that the correct logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted is used.
