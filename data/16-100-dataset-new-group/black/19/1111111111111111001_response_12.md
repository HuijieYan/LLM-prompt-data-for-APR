The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could be caused by the conditional blocks within the function that do not return values as expected. It's also possible that some conditions may not be triggered correctly, leading to incorrect outputs. Additionally, incorrect handling of the `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` attributes of the `current_line` object could be causing the function to produce an unexpected result.

To fix the bug, we should restructure the function to better handle the conditional logic. We should also verify that the conditions for each attribute of the `current_line` object are being correctly set and evaluated.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return (0, 0)

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return (0, 0)

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return (newlines, 0)

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return (before, 1)

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import \
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield \
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should be able to handle the conditional logic effectively and produce the expected outputs. Additionally, it should resolve the failing test case.
