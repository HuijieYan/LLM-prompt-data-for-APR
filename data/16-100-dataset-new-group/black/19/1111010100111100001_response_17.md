Given the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the variables right before the buggy function's return, it looks like there is no significant issue with the input parameters and the variables within the function.

The bug is likely caused by the faulty conditions and calculations within the function that determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

Looking at the function's logics, it seems that there are some inconsistent or incorrect conditional checks related to the number of allowable empty lines. Additionally, the manipulation of `before` and other variables within the function might not be correct, leading to the incorrect number of empty lines or incorrect handling of the decorators, imports, yields, and flow control blocks.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review and correct the conditional checks, variable manipulations, and logic related to the number of empty lines and their placement. This involves verifying the conditions and updating the variable values accurately based on the logic explained in the class docs and the requirements for the number of empty lines around different types of code blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if not is_decorator and (self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator):
        return 0, 0
    
    if is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditionals and variable manipulations have been updated to correctly handle the different scenarios based on the type of code block and the depth of the line, as per the requirements explained in the class docs.
