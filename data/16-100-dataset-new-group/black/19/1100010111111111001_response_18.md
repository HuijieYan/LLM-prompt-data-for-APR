The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely due to the incorrect processing of the `before` value within certain scenarios, causing the output to not match the expected values. This results in an incorrect count of newlines and incorrect formatting of the resulting string.

The logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be updated to handle cases where decorators and yield statements are detected, as well as to handle the processing of the `before` value in a manner consistent with the expected output.

To fix this bug, I suggest the inclusion of additional conditional checks for the scenarios in which the `before` value should be determined differently, particularly for decorators and yield statements. Additionally, the logic for handling import statements should also be included as part of the fix.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these changes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function attempts to handle the scenarios related to decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yield statements more accurately.

This corrected version should help address the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output values.
