Issue:
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to contain a logical error causing incorrect behavior during the runtime analysis.

Explanation:
When we analyze the runtime values based on the function's parameters, the program seems to not always return the expected values based on the inputs and conditions. Specifically, the instances where 'max_allowed' could be 1 or 2 are not being correctly managed.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic related to managing 'max_allowed' and 'before' within the function to accurately reflect the expected return values based on the input parameters and conditions.
2. Update the logic to handle the 'is_decorator', 'is_yield' and other condition handling to ensure the expected return values.
3. Consider refactoring the function for better readability and maintainability.

The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed) if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth == 0:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 2 if depth else 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` has been modified with updated logic to handle 'max_allowed', 'before', 'is_decorator', 'is_yield', and other conditions to ensure the return values match the expected output based on the input parameters and conditions provided. This update should resolve the logical error that caused inconsistent behavior.

Please note that this is a suggested correction based on the information provided, and further testing may be required to ensure the correctness of the updated logic.
