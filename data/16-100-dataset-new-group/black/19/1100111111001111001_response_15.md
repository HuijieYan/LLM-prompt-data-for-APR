The bug in the given function involves misinterpretation of the input parameters and incorrect return values. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is expected to perform checks based on the input `current_line` and determine how many empty lines to return before or after the current line. The function takes into account the depth of the line, whether it's a decorator, a definition, a class, flow control, or an import. 

The possible issues identified with the function are:
1. It incorrectly recalculates `before` and `max_allowed` values without considering previous calculations.
2. The assignment for `before` value inside the while loop takes into account minimum of either `before` or `max_allowed` instead of increasing it.

To fix this issue, the flow control and `if` conditions need to be reviewed. There might be some overlapping or conflicting logic.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    before = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if any([current_line.is_decorator, current_line.is_def, current_line.is_class]):
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the updated version, some of the variables such as `before` and `max_allowed` are recalculated correctly, and the order of checking the conditions takes into account the previous checks. This revised version should fix the issues in the previous version of the function.
