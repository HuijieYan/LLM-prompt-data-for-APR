The bug occurs due to the incorrect assignment of the variable `before`. The value of `before` is being reassigned inside the `while` loop, but the effect of this reassignment is not clear. Additionally, in some cases, the return statements seem to be returning incorrect values. The `newlines` variable is being set to a hardcoded value in one case, which may not be appropriate for all cases.

It appears that this function is supposed to calculate the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line and whether to insert empty lines after the current line based on the previous line and the current line's attributes.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully evaluate the conditions inside the function and ensure that the correct values are being assigned to the `before` variable according to the defined logic.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for calculating `before` has been simplified by using the `min` and `max` functions where necessary. Also, the return statements have been adjusted to follow the defined logic for the different cases.
