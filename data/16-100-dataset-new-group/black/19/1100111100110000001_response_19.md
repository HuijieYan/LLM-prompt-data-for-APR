The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be part of a larger codebase that is used for formatting Python code. It checks various conditions related to indentation, decorators, imports, flow controls, and yields to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted in the code.

The function checks the depth of the current line and modifies the `before` variable based on various conditions. It also handles cases related to decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to adjust the number of empty lines to be added.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected and actual formatted code is not the same, specifically in an area related to comments and decorators.

The function may have several issues that could lead to the incorrect formatting, such as:
1. Incorrect handling of indentation levels and conditions related to decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.
2. Inaccurate adjustment of empty lines based on the previous and current lines.
3. Inconsistencies in handling the different cases that may require empty lines.

For fixing the bug, the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be thoroughly reviewed and revised to ensure that it accurately determines the number of empty lines based on the specific conditions of the code. Additionally, the handling of comments, decorators, imports, and indentation levels should be carefully evaluated.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1
    
    if self.previous_line is None or current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return max_allowed, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max_allowed, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max_allowed, 0

    return max_allowed, 0
```

In this corrected version, the specific conditions for adjusting the number of empty lines have been simplified and modified to ensure proper formatting of the code. This version incorporates more straightforward logic to handle decorators, flow control, imports, and yields, and to maintain the correct indentation in the code.
