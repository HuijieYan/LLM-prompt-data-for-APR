Based on the provided code, the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The purpose of this function is to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

There are multiple potential errors within the function. Some of the issues include:
1. Incorrect usage of depth variable, specifically in the condition checks.
2. Inconsistent handling of empty lines before and after the current line.
3. Unclear logic for determining the number of new lines to be inserted in different scenarios.

The cause of the bug may be due to the inconsistent logic to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. Additionally, the handling of depth and previous line conditions seems to be ambiguous.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve:
1. Clarify the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.
2. Ensure that the depth variable and previous line conditions are appropriately used to handle different scenarios.
3. Simplify the function to improve readability and maintainability.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    # Logic for handling previous definitions
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Logic for handling import and yield conditions
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield
            and depth != self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version, the logic for handling previous definitions, decorators, and various line types has been improved and simplified for better understanding and accuracy.
