The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the way it computes the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. Based on the provided test cases and the analysis of the function's behavior, the bug arises due to incorrect logic for determining the number of empty lines in certain conditional branches.

The bug stems from the incorrect handling of the `is_decorator` and `current_line.depth` conditions. When `is_decorator` is True or `current_line.is_def` or `current_line.is_class` are True, the function does not correctly calculate the number of empty lines.

The fix involves revisiting the logic for handling `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` conditions to ensure that the number of empty lines is correctly calculated based on these conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With the corrected logic, the function should now correctly compute the number of empty lines required before and after the currently processed line for the test cases provided.
