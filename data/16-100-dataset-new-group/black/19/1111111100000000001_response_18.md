There are multiple issues that need to be addressed in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

1. The function calls attributes that are not defined in the `EmptyLineTracker` class such as `current_line.depth`, `current_line.leaves`, `current_line.is_decorator`, etc. This suggests that these attributes have to be part of the `Line` class but are not being accessed properly within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

2. The logic for setting the `before` value and modifying the `first_leaf.prefix` seems to be incorrect, as it is working with the assumption that certain attributes exist in the `current_line` variable.

3. There is a mix of functional and object-oriented approaches within the function. It seems that the function should be either part of the `Line` class, making use of its attributes, or more of a standalone function that takes parameters explicitly.

The recommended action to fix the bug includes:
- Move the `_maybe_empty_lines` function inside the `Line` class as a method, and modify the arguments accordingly. This will allow access to the class attributes without raising an exception.
- If the function is intended to be part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, pass the `current_line` variables as arguments to the function when calling it.
- Correct the logic within the function so that it no longer relies on attributes that are not directly accessible from the scope it's in.
- Ensure that the code is consistent with either functional or object-oriented programming style.

The fixed version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is as follows:

```python
class Line:
    # ... Define attributes and class methods for Line class ...

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    # ... Define other methods and attributes for EmptyLineTracker class ...

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```
This code assumes that the `Line` class has been defined elsewhere and its methods and attributes are accessible within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
