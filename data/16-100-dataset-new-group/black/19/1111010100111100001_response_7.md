1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes in a `Line` object named `current_line` and is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

2. The potential error locations are within the logic blocks and conditions, particularly around the computation of `newlines` and the conditions for returning the tuple `(before, 1)`.

3. The cause of the bug may be due to improper handling of cases where the depth of the current line is 0 and the conditions for returning values where `current_line.is_decorator` or `self.previous_line.is_decorator`.

4. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the conditions and logic blocks to ensure correct handling of cases based on the depth of the current line, whether it is a decorator, and the previous line attributes.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now handle the various conditions and return the correct tuple based on the input `current_line` and the attributes of the current and previous lines.
