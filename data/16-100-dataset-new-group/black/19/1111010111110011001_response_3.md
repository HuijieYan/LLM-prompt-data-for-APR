I noticed that the test case captures a lot of different conditions that lead to the failure of the buggy function. It's also reporting the expected values based on the behavior that the test expects.

Therefore, after fixing the buggy function based on these expected values and code comprehension, the improved function is as follows. This function contains the necessary improvements to pass the test cases:

1. Set the `max_allowed` value based on the `current_line.depth`.
2. Updated the condition for checking if `is_decorator` when inserting empty lines.
3. Added the condition to consider the case when a line is a flow control.

These changes should fix the issues that cause the failing test, thereby improving the function.
