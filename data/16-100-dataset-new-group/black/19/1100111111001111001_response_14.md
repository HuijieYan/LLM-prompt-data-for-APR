The bug in the given function is related to the handling of newlines and indentation in the input lines. Based on the failing tests and expected outputs, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation depth, previous lines, and various types of code lines (decorators, def, class, yield, flow control, and import). Without the actual implementation details of related classes (Line, Leaf, EmptyLineTracker, BracketTracker), it is difficult to provide a precise fix for the bug. However, based on the provided information, it's clear that the affected variables at the return of the function need to be adjusted according to the expected values.

Considering the details provided, here is a corrected version of the given buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

It's important to note that the accuracy of this corrected version heavily relies on the actual implementation details of the related classes and functions (e.g., Line, Leaf, EmptyLineTracker, BracketTracker). Therefore, the corrected version may need additional adjustments based on these details.
