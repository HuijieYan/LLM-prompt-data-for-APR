The issue with the provided _maybe_empty_lines function seems to be related to the conditionals and the value of the variables `newlines` and `before`.

Explanation:
- The input parameters of the function are `current_line` of type `Line`, and `self` of type `EmptyLineTracker`.
- The function checks if the `current_line` is a decorator, def, class, or a flow control statement and updates `newlines` and `before` accordingly.
- However, the buggy function is not aligning with the expected logic. The conditions that update `newlines` and `before` are not covering all possible cases. This results in unexpected behavior and the failing tests.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Reduce the complexity by breaking the logic into multiple self-contained conditions.
- Identify all possible cases and ensure that the conditions cover them appropriately.
- Make sure that the assignments to `newlines` and `before` are correct for each case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    newlines = 0
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This should fix the logic and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all possible cases.
