The potential error locations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function are as follows:

1. The if condition `if current_line.is_flow_control:` followed by `return before, 1` suggests that an empty line will be added before the current line and 1 empty line will be added after the current line if it is a flow control.
2. The if condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:` will add an empty line before the current line under the given conditions.
3. The if condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):` will add an empty line before the current line under the given conditions.

The potential error in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by incorrect logic and conditions that lead to the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to modify the conditions and logic used to calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before_empty_lines = 0
    after_empty_lines = 0

    if not self.previous_line:  # First line in the file, no empty lines needed
        return before_empty_lines, after_empty_lines

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before_empty_lines = 2
    else:
        before_empty_lines = 1

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before_empty_lines, after_empty_lines

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth
    ):
        before_empty_lines = 1

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or self.previous_line.depth != current_line.depth)
    ):
        before_empty_lines = 1

    return before_empty_lines, after_empty_lines
```
In the corrected version, the logic for counting the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line has been simplified and corrected based on the original intention of the function. Additionally, the conditions for adding empty lines have been adjusted and properly evaluated.
