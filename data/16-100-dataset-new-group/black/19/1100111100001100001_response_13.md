Looking at the buggy function and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue is related to how the `max_allowed` value is determined and assigned. The buggy function is supposed to look for certain conditions in the `current_line` object and set the `max_allowed` value based on those conditions. However, there are inconsistencies in how the `max_allowed` value is used.

The main cause of the bug seems to be the inconsistent use of `max_allowed` to determine the count of newlines. In some cases, `max_allowed` is set to 2 but then re-evaluated, leading to unexpected newlines being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditions for setting `max_allowed` are properly checked and the correct value is used consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version, we ensure that `max_allowed` is properly set and consistently used throughout the function. This should resolve the inconsistencies and fix the buggy behavior.
