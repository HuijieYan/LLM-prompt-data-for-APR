The bug is caused by incorrect indentation logic. When generating newlines, the function does not properly assess the need for them based on the context and the previous line's attributes. 

The function `_maybe_empty_lines` receives a `current_line` as input and determines whether empty lines should be inserted before it based on various criteria. The goal is to correctly identify where indentations and newlines are needed in a code snippet.

The buggy function has a faulty logic when determining the value of `newlines` and does not account for all scenarios when deciding whether to insert empty lines before the `current_line`. The cases that need to be addressed include decorators, flow control, imports, yields, and empty lines in the file.

To fix the bug, the function will use the values of `is_decorator`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` to determine the correct number of newlines to insert before `current_line`.

A corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is provided below:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version, the function correctly sets `max_allowed` based on `current_line.depth`, uses `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, and `current_line.is_yield` to calculate the number of newlines, and ensures that the correct number of newlines is inserted.
