The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class appears to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The root cause of the bug seems to be incorrect handling of empty lines and a flawed logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted.

Upon analyzing the function, the following potential error locations are identified:
1. Improper handling of the `depth` and `is_decorator` properties of the `current_line`.
2. Flawed logic for determining the number of newlines based on the current line type.
3. Incorrect comparison of `current_line` with `previous_line` properties for different scenarios.

The `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to have issues with properly updating the `before` and `newlines` counters based on different conditions. Additionally, the conditions and comparisons used for `current_line` and `previous_line` properties might not be accurate, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, a strategy would involve carefully reviewing the logic of the function and identifying the conditions for different types of lines (e.g., decorators, imports, flow control, etc.). Ensuring proper handling of the `depth` and `is_decorator` properties would be crucial. Additionally, validating the comparisons with the `previous_line` property and updating the `before` and `newlines` counters based on the specific scenarios would help in resolving the bug.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    newlines = 0

    # Check the type of the current line and update counts accordingly
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 2 if depth else 1
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines = 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        newlines = max(before, 1)
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        newlines = max(before, 1)

    return before, newlines
```

In the corrected version, the logic for updating `before` and `newlines` counts is simplified and adjusted based on the type of the current line. This should address the issues with the original version and the failing test.
