The bug appears to be caused by the `is_decorator` attribute not being checked properly. This leads to issues when computing the number of empty lines required before and after the currently processed line.

To fix the bug, it's important to correctly handle the case when `is_decorator` is True, and to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted. Additionally, we need to check if `current_line` is the first line in the file to avoid inserting empty lines before it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if not current_line.leaves:
        return 0, 0
    
    # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
    before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
    before = min(before, max_allowed)
    first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should handle all edge cases and pass the failing test.
