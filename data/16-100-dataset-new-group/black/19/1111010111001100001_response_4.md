### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be incorrectly calculating the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function has multiple conditional statements to determine the number of empty lines, but the logic appears to be complex and error-prone.

### Causes of the Bug
The bug might be caused due to incorrect calculations inside the function, leading to incorrect returning of the number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Simplify the logic of the function to determine the number of empty lines.
2. Ensure that the conditional statements cover all possible cases and provide correct calculations.
3. Update the logic to properly handle cases where empty lines need to be inserted or skipped.

### Bug Fix
The code provided for the bug fix simplifies the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to calculate the correct number of empty lines required before and after the current line.

```python
# Buggy function fixed
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    newlines_before = 0
    newlines_after = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_line:
        prev_depth = self.previous_line.depth
        if depth > prev_depth:
            newlines_before = 1
        if depth < prev_depth:
            newlines_after = 1
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator:
            newlines_before = 0
            newlines_after = 0

    self.previous_line = current_line
    return newlines_before, newlines_after
```

This fix simplifies the logic to calculate the required newlines before and after the current line based on the depth and type of the current and previous lines. It ensures that the necessary number of empty lines is returned based on the specific conditions.

After implementing this fix, re-run the failing test to verify that the corrected function provides the expected results.
