The issue with the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is that it is not computing the correct number of empty lines that should be inserted before and after the currently processed line. This is resulting in a failed test case where the expected and actual output do not match due to incorrect empty line formatting.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function calculates the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. It appears to be incorrectly handling the cases of decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be rewritten to correctly calculate the number of empty lines based on the context and type of the currently processed line. This involves revising the logic for calculating `before` and `newlines` based on the conditions specified in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines for decorators
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines between decorators
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1  # Insert 1 empty line after flow control statements
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0  # Insert 1 empty line after import statements
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0  # Insert 1 empty line after yield statements
    else:
        return 0, 0  # Default case: don't insert any empty lines
```

The corrected function applies the correct logic for handling various types of lines and their corresponding empty line insertions. Additionally, it resolves the incorrect handling of empty lines for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

After applying the fix, the `assertFormatEqual` test case should pass without any assertion errors.
