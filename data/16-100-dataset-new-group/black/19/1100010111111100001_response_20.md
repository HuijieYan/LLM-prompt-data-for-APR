The potential error location occurs when determining the number of newlines to insert before the current line. This includes checking conditions like the depth of the current line and the presence of leaves in the current line.

The cause of the bug is that the calculations for the number of newlines to insert before the current line are not correctly taking into account the nesting level of decorators and other structural elements, leading to incorrect insertion of newlines in the formatted output.

To fix the bug, we should revise the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before the current line based on the presence of leaves, the previous line's characteristics, and any structural elements like decorators, definitions, imports, and flow control.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    def is_empty_line():
        if current_line.depth:
            return 1
        return 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        return 0, 0

    if not self.previous_line or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator):
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return is_empty_line(), 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return is_empty_line(), 0
```
