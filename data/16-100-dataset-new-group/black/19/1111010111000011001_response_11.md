The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises due to the mishandling of the `before` variable and the `newlines` variable. The expected outputs for these variables are not being generated due to incorrect value assignments.

To address the bug, the following steps can be taken:
- Ensure that the `before` variable is correctly assigned by adding conditions or logic as necessary.
- Properly calculate and assign the value of the `newlines` variable as per the conditions specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        elif (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        elif (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
    else:
        before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
            is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
            if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
                if not is_decorator:
                    self.previous_defs.append(depth)
                if self.previous_line is None:
                    # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                    return 0, 0
                if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                    # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                    return 0, 0
                newlines = 2
                if current_line.depth:
                    newlines -= 1
                return newlines, 0
            elif current_line.is_flow_control:
                return before, 1
            elif (
                self.previous_line
                and self.previous_line.is_import
                and not current_line.is_import
                and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
            ):
                return (before or 1), 0
            elif (
                self.previous_line
                and self.previous_line.is_yield
                and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
            ):
                return (before or 1), 0
            return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now produce the expected outputs as per the defined test cases.
