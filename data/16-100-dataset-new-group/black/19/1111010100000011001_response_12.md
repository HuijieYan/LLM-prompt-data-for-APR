To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it's important to first understand the expected behavior. The function is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It also has to consider various conditions such as whether the current line is a decorator, import, def, class, flow control, or yield.

After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the `EmptyLineTracker` class, I have identified the potential error locations:

1. The logic for setting `max_allowed` and `before` variables seems to be incorrect.
2. There are multiple return statements within the function, which might cause unexpected behavior.
3. The conditions for checking different line types (decorator, import, def, class, etc.) need to be revisited.

The cause of the bug could be related to incorrect handling of the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` variables, as well as the conditions for different types of lines. Additionally, there is inconsistent variable usage within the function.

To fix this bug, the function should be refactored to have a clearer and more structured flow. We need to revisit the conditions for decorators, imports, defs, classes, flow control, and yields, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is returned in each case.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle the different cases for the input parameters and satisfy the expected input/output variables as specified.
