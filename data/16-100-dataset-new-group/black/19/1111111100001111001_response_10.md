The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that need to be addressed for each case.

In the first case, it incorrectly returns newlines as 2 when it should be 0, and before as 0 when it should be 2.

In the second case, it again incorrectly calculates the before and newlines values.

In the third case, it also incorrectly returns the newlines as 2 and before as 0, when it should be 0 and 1 respectively.

In the fourth case, it has the same issues as the third case.

In the fifth case, it incorrectly returns newlines as 2 when it should be 0, and before as 0 when it should be 2.

In the sixth case, it repeats the same issues as the third and fourth cases.

In the seventh case, it doesn't return the expected previous_defs list and incorrectly returns the before and newlines values.

In the eighth case, it returns the wrong max_allowed and incorrectly calculates the before and newlines values.

To fix these issues, the conditions in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should be updated. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before, 0
    return before, 0
```
