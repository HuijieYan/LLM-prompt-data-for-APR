The potential cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to the incorrect calculation of the `before` value and the improper handling of conditions for adding empty lines. The function is not correctly handling the `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `is_decorator` conditions, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, the conditions for empty lines insertion should be revised to accurately capture the intended logic flow, aligned with the requirements of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    # logic for handling previous_defs and insertion of empty lines
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    # condition for return value based on line properties
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the handling of `before` value is adjusted for consistent calculation. Additionally, the conditions for inserting empty lines are updated to align with the class requirements.

These changes should address the potential bugs in the previous version of the function.
