The buggy code seems to contain several issues. Let's analyze each one by one and correct them:

1. The max_allowed variable is always set to 1 during the initialization but should be set to 2 initially and then later on changes to 1 in certain cases. This is causing the functions to return the wrong values.

2. The first_leaf variable is not being initialized properly. Its assignment seems to be inconsistent, and the expected types and values of variables are not met for certain cases.

3. The before variable, which represents the number of lines before the leaf, is assigned a value of 0 every time and should be initialized based on the condition. It might not be capturing the correct preceding lines.

4. The newlines variable is being set within an if condition but should be set unconditionally.

5. The previous_defs list is being manipulated and should be handled carefully.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have fixed the initialization of variables along with proper assignment and handling of variable values based on conditions. This should now meet the expected values and types for all the test cases.
