The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several errors. The major issue is the logic to handle empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This logic seems to be incorrect, as it is not producing the expected output. This is leading to a failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` with an `AssertionError`.

The `AssertionError` is indicating that the `assertFormatEqual` method in the test case is failing. This method is used to compare the expected and actual formatted code and verify that they are equal. The error message shows that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted code.

The cause of the bug is an incorrect computation of the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for this computation, and it's not functioning as expected.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be adjusted to correctly calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines = max(0, newlines - 1)
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I've made adjustments to the computation of the `newlines` variable to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the conditions specified in the function. Additionally, I've updated the logic for handling the depth of the current line to fix potential issues with empty lines in certain scenarios.
