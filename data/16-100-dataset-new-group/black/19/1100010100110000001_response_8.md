## Analysis
The error message suggests a formatting issue with empty lines. The `assertFormatEqual` function is failing, indicating that the expected and actual outputs differ, specifically in terms of empty lines.

## Identified potential error locations
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be the source of the bug, where it determines the number of empty lines to insert before a given line of code.
2. The conditionals within the function that calculate the number of empty lines may not be handling all cases correctly, resulting in the mismatch in empty lines observed in the error message.
3. The logic for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields might be causing unexpected insertion of empty lines.

## Explanation of the bug
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is incorrectly determining the number of empty lines to insert before a given line of code. This incorrect calculation is leading to a formatting mismatch, which is evident from the failing test and the error message.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Review and modify the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is determined for each case.
2. Pay particular attention to cases involving decorators, flow control, imports, and yields, as these appear to be potential areas of incorrect empty line insertion.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
After fixing the logic within the function, run the failing test case again to ensure that the correction has resolved the formatting issue.
