The cause of the bug is likely due to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function not correctly accounting for the presence of comments within decorators. This causes the test `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail with an AssertionError indicating a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be modified to handle comments within decorators properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        # Handle comments within decorators
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Count the number of empty lines in the previous line and add 1 more
            empty_lines_count = self.previous_line.suffix.count('\n') + 1
            return empty_lines_count, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, a specific handling for comments within decorators is added to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the presence of comments. This should address the issue with the failing test.
