The error message is indicating that there is a difference between the expected and actual output when the `assertFormatEqual` function is called. This suggests that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not properly adding or removing empty lines in the output, leading to a formatting difference.

The potential error locations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function can be identified by examining its logic and the conditions under which it modifies the number of empty lines before and after the current line. It seems that the logic for handling empty lines before and after decorators, flow control, imports, and yields might be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of empty lines before and after certain types of lines in the code. This results in the formatting difference between the expected and actual output, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that it correctly calculates the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the specific conditions mentioned in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines_before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        newlines_after = 0
        return newlines_before, newlines_after

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, the logic for handling empty lines before and after decorators, flow control, imports, and yields has been reviewed and adjusted to ensure correct formatting. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
