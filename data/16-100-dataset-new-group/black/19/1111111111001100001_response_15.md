The buggy function has multiple issues related to its logic and variable use. One potential cause of the bug in recognizing the correct number of empty lines is the improper initialization of the `max_allowed` variable before using it to set the number of empty lines.

Another issue is the incorrect handling of the `before` variable, which is likely not updating properly, leading to incorrect results in determining the number of empty lines.

To fix the bug, the `max_allowed` initialization should be corrected and the update logic for the `before` variable should be adjusted to reflect the intended behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the `max_allowed` value is calculated based on the condition `if current_line.depth == 0`, and the `before` variable is updated appropriately based on different conditions.

After applying these fixes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should pass the failing test cases.
