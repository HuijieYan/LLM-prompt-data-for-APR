The bug is located in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The issue is that the method is not calculating the potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line correctly, which leads to failing tests. 

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly computing the potential extra empty lines needed before and after the processed line. This error arises from not properly updating the state of variables when evaluating the conditions for the different types of line elements.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review and update the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the different types of line elements and update the state of variables accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.depth:
        newlines = 1
    else:
        newlines = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected function should now correctly handle the different conditions for the line elements and update the state of variables accordingly. This should address the issue with failing tests and make the `_maybe_empty_lines` function function correctly within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
