The issue with the buggy function is that the return values in various conditional branches are not being calculated properly. This is causing the function to return incorrect values in some cases, leading to test failures.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the return values are correctly calculated based on the input conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if not self.previous_line:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should satisfy the input/output expectations for the failing test cases. Any additional details required for fixing the bug can be further discussed.
