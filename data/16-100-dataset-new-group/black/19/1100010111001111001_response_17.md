The issue with the function is the incorrect calculation of the `before` variable. The `before` variable should be calculated based on conditions, but the existing implementation does not cover all scenarios. Furthermore, there is an issue with the logic implementation as the `depth` variable is also affected and does not properly account for all cases. To fix this, we need to revise the logic for the `before` and `depth` variables.

Based on the failing test cases and the expected results, the following changes need to be made:
1. The max_allowed condition needs to be handled consistently.
2. Calculate the depth and before values based on specific conditions.
3. Adjust the values of the `depth` variable to ensure accurate representation of the depth.
4. The code also needs to consider the insertion of empty lines in various scenarios based on the current and previous line settings.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        if before > max_allowed:
            before = max_allowed
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    if (self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator) and \
       (current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class or current_line.is_decorator):
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
          (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```

With these corrections, the function should now behave as expected with the given test cases and meet the expected outcomes.

Please test and confirm how it works with the past failing test cases. Let me know if you encounter any further issues.
