The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is used to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It takes a `Line` object as input and returns a tuple of integers.

The potential error locations within the function could be related to the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be inserted. This is indicated by the failing test's assertion error, which suggests that the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines.

The cause of the bug might be due to incorrect condition checks and logic flow within the function. The failing test message indicates that there are discrepancies in the number of empty lines inserted, which means that the function is not correctly calculating the required empty lines based on the input `Line` object.

To fix the bug, we need to review the parts of the function where it determines the number of empty lines to be inserted and ensure that the logic aligns with the intended behavior. This may involve adjusting condition checks, variable assignments, and the final return values to accurately reflect the expected number of empty lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line:
            return 0, newlines

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

In this corrected version of the function, the conditions and logic for determining the number of empty lines have been adjusted to correctly handle different scenarios based on the input `Line` object.
