The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several potential errors that could be causing it to fail. Here are some potential causes of the bug:
1. The logic for calculating `before` and `newlines` might not be correct, leading to incorrect calculations of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
2. The conditions for checking `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` might not be working as intended, leading to incorrect behavior based on the type of the current line.
3. The use of `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs` might not be updating correctly or being accessed improperly, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, you should carefully review the logic for calculating `before` and `newlines`, as well as the conditions for checking the type of the current line and the handling of `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def() or current_line.is_class():
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control():
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` are called as methods on `current_line`. We also update the logic for calculating `before` and handle `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs` updates correctly.

After applying the above changes, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should pass the failing test.
