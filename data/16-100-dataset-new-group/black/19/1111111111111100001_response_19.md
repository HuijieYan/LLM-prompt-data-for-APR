The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class is related to the incorrect handling of empty lines. The code is not correctly handling cases where decorators, definitions (def), classes, and other control flow statements are present. As a result, the function fails multiple tests and produces incorrect output for various cases. The runtime analysis of the function's input and output values indicates that the issue seems to be with how the conditional statements are structured, leading to improper handling of different types of lines.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements handling the various types of lines and their corresponding handling of empty lines need to be restructured.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Corrected version of _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if not current_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_def and not current_line.is_class and not current_line.is_flow_control and not current_line.is_import and not current_line.is_yield:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_defs and current_line.depth <= self.previous_defs[-1]:
            before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_defs and current_line.depth <= self.previous_defs[-1]:
            before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
```

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function provides appropriate handling for different types of lines including decorators, definitions, classes, and control flow statements. This revised version addresses the issues identified in the previous runtime analysis and is expected to fix the bug.

With this corrected function, the failing test case should now pass.
