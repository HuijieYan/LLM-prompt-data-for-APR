The bug in the function is that the variables `before` and `newlines` are being incorrectly calculated based on the conditions within the function. Additionally, there are issues with the manipulation of the `self.previous_defs` and `first_leaf.prefix` variables. 

To fix the bug, we will:
1. Correct the calculation of `before` and `newlines` based on the conditions provided.
2. Address the manipulation of `self.previous_defs` and `first_leaf.prefix` variables to ensure they have the intended and correct values.


Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        if before > max_allowed:
            first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.replace("\n", "", before - max_allowed)
            before = max_allowed

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
By correcting the calculation of `before` and `newlines` and addressing the manipulation of `self.previous_defs` and `first_leaf.prefix`, the corrected function is expected to satisfy all the given cases.
