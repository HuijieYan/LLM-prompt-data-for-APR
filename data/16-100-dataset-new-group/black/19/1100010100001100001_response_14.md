The bug within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused due to incorrect logic and conditions leading to the wrong output.

The incorrect logic for setting the `max_allowed` variable for empty lines and the handling of decorators is leading to the buggy behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, the logic for setting `max_allowed` needs to be adjusted and the conditions for both decorators and empty lines need to be correctly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0 and not current_line.is_decorator:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, before), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(1, before), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions and logic for setting `max_allowed` are adjusted and the handling of decorators and empty lines is properly addressed to fix the buggy behavior of the function.
