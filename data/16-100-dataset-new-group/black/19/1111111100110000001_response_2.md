The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, which is responsible for managing state related to the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function takes a `Line` object as input and is expected to return a tuple of integers representing the number of empty lines before and after the line.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the actual output of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function does not match the expected output. This discrepancy is causing an assertion error in the test.

Based on the error message and the comparison of the expected and actual output, it can be inferred that the bug lies in the behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in handling the insertion of empty lines. The incorrect handling of empty lines, as well as the conditions for defining when to insert empty lines, is causing the mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, a review of the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is needed, with special attention to the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the current line. Additionally, the handling of various attributes of the `current_line` and `self.previous_line` objects should be thoroughly examined to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if any([current_line.is_decorator, current_line.is_def, current_line.is_class]):
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not any([current_line.is_import, current_line.is_yield]) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the handling of prefix newlines, insertion of empty lines, and the conditions for different line types are fixed to ensure that the function returns the correct number of empty lines before and after the line. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.
