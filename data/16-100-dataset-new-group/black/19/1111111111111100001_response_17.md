Looking at the buggy function and the failing test case, it seems that the `self.previous_defs` list is not being used properly. This list is used to track the depth of previous def statements encountered, and it is being updated based on certain conditions. However, the update logic seems incorrect, as it is not properly handling the insertion of new values and their removal in certain scenarios.

The issue seems to be related to the usage of `self.previous_defs` list for tracking the depth levels. When appending a new depth level, it does not consider the current depth value properly. It's updating `self.previous_defs` without considering the depth values, leading to unexpected behavior when checking against the previous depth.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic of appending and removing elements from the `self.previous_defs` list based on the current `depth` value to handle the empty line logic properly. This will allow the function to accurately track and calculate the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs = [d for d in self.previous_defs if d < depth]
        before = 1 if depth else max_allowed
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version, the previous depth levels are now properly adjusted when appending and removing, ensuring that the correct behavior is maintained based on the current depth value.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test case pass.
