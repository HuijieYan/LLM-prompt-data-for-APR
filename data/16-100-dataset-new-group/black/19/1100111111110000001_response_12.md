The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the condition `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` is being checked incorrectly, resulting in the wrong number of newlines being returned. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual output, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition and then ensure that the correct number of newlines are returned based on the conditions for different types of lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
        and not current_line.is_import(self)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
        and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` is checked with the correct logical operator 'or'. Additionally, the calls to `is_import` and `is_yield` functions are updated to pass the `self` parameter.

After making these changes, the updated `_maybe_empty_lines` function should pass the failing test without any assertion errors.
