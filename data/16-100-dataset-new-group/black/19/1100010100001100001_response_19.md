The bug occurs because the "before" variable is being overwritten by different conditional blocks, such as the `if current_line.leaves` block and the `while self.previous_defs` block.

To avoid overwriting "before," the program should use other variables to store intermediate values. Additionally, it seems the program was intended to return `newlines, 0` when `current_line.is_flow_control` is True, but it currently returns `before, 1`.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before_leaves = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before_leaves = min(before_leaves, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before_leaves = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    previous_defs_checked = False
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        previous_defs_checked = True

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before_leaves, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before_leaves or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before_leaves or 1), 0

    return before_leaves, 0
```
