The main issue with the buggy function is that the logic and conditionals inside the function are not correctly handling the rules for inserting empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The various conditional statements and comparisons are leading to incorrect calculations of the number of empty lines to be inserted.

The main correction strategy would be to review and correct the conditional statements and comparisons within the function. Proper rules need to be established for when to return the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This should be based on the type of line being processed, the depth, and the previous line's type and depth.

Considering the runtime values and types of input parameters and the variables within the function, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is not None and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return min(before or 1, max_allowed), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return min(before or 1, max_allowed), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditional statements and comparisons have been properly adjusted based on the provided runtime values and types of input parameters and the variables within the function. This should address the issues and provide the expected behavior for the function.
