The bug in the provided function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to the inconsistent handling of the `before` and `newlines` variables based on the different conditions. The definition of the `before` and `newlines` variables is denoting the number of empty lines before and after the current line, respectively. The logic and conditions for calculating and returning these values are not aligned properly, leading to incorrect output.

The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` contains several conditional blocks that determine the values of `before` and `newlines` based on the properties of the `current_line` and `previous_line`. However, the combination of conditions and the inconsistencies in updating the values of these variables appear to result in incorrect computations.

The root cause of the bug is likely the incorrect calculation of `before` and `newlines` based on the conditional checks for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` properties, as well as the depth of the lines and the state of the `previous_line`.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and the update of `before` and `newlines` need to be aligned properly with the expected behavior according to the given logic. Also, the conditional blocks related to the previous line's attributes need to be reviewed for consistency and correctness.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# Updated and fixed version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = min(current_line.prefix.count('\n'), max_allowed)
    current_line.prefix = ''
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    is_decorator_or_definition = current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class
    if is_decorator_or_definition:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    return newlines, 0
```

In this corrected version, the calculation of `before` and `newlines` has been modified to ensure proper alignment with the conditional checks, and the state of the `current_line` and `previous_line`. The conditional blocks have been revised to avoid inconsistencies and produce the correct output based on the function's expected behavior. This should resolve the issues and make the function pass the failing test.
