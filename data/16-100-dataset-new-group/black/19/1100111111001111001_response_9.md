The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic for determining the number of newlines in certain conditions is flawed, causing the function to not return the expected values. The logic for setting the `newlines` variable should be reviewed and corrected to accurately reflect the expected behavior.

The corrected version of the function can be implemented by updating the logic for setting the `newlines` variable and adjusting the conditions for returning the correct number of newlines. Based on the provided expected values, the logic should be as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    # Determine the depth and set is_decorator flag
    depth = current_line.depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected logic, the value of `max_allowed` is correctly set based on the depth of the current line. Additionally, the conditions that determine the number of newlines are updated to align with the expected behavior for the test cases.

This implementation should address the issues and ensure that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function passes the tests and returns the expected results for the provided cases.
