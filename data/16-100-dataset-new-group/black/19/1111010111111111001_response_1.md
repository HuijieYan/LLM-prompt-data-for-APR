The cause of the bug is that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` returns an incorrect output. Since the function calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line, and it does not efficiently handle these calculations.

At the return of the function, the variables `max_allowed`, `first_leaf`, `before`, `depth`, and `is_decorator` all have incorrect values for at least one of the input cases. The function does not seem to effectively calculate the needed empty lines based on the input parameters.

To fix the bug, limit the number of condition checks involving variable assignments within the function. Instead, change the approach to more directly handle and return the exact required number of empty lines before and after the current line.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

The corrected function includes reorganized conditions for different cases, ensuring that the calculation of empty lines is done accurately based on the input parameters.

In addition to the corrected function, it's important to run the failing test cases to confirm that the corrected function now returns the expected values. This would validate that the bug has been successfully addressed.
