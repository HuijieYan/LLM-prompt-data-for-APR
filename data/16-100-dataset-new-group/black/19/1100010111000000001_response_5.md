The potential error location in the buggy function could be in the logic where it determines the number of newlines to be inserted based on different conditions like `is_decorator`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to incorrect handling of the conditions that determine the number of newlines to be inserted. Specifically, the conditions for `is_decorator` and `before` calculation may not be properly handled, resulting in incorrect newline insertion.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review the conditions for determining the number of newlines to be inserted and ensure that they are properly handled. Additionally, the logic for handling `is_decorator` and `before` variables should be thoroughly checked and corrected if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling `is_decorator` and `before` variables has been revised to properly handle the conditions and ensure correct newline insertion. Additionally, the conditions for inserting empty lines before the first line in the file and between decorators have been updated to prevent incorrect newline insertion.
