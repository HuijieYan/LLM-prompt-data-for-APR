The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be causing incorrect handling of empty lines between blocks. After analyzing the function and the test cases, it appears that the main issue is with the logic used to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted between certain types of lines.

Based on the input parameters and the runtime values and types of variables, it is clear that the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert is flawed. The runtime values and types of variables right before the function's return do not seem to be consistent with the expectations based on the input parameters. This leads to incorrect decisions about the number of empty lines to be added before certain types of lines, resulting in failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before certain types of lines needs to be revised. This might involve changes to the conditions and their corresponding operations in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
    
    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth
    ):
        return newlines, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or self.previous_line.depth != current_line.depth)
    ):
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return max_allowed, 1

    return max_allowed, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling different types of lines has been adjusted, and the conditions have been revised to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the context of the current and previous lines.

By using this corrected version of the function, it is expected that the failing test cases will be resolved. However, it's important to thoroughly test this corrected version to ensure that it accurately handles different scenarios.
