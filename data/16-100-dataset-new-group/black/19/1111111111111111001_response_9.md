The analysis of the buggy function indicates that the error is likely caused by incorrect handling of whitespace before and after certain leaf objects, and conditions returning incorrect values. In particular, the `max_allowed` variable, the assignment of the `before` variable, and the use of the `is_decorator` variable appear to be potential error locations. The `before` variable is being calculated based on the count of newline characters in the `prefix` attribute of `first_leaf`, but the subsequent application of the `min` function to the `max_allowed` variable suggests that the `before` variable should be constrained by the `max_allowed` value. Additionally, the conditions for returning `newlines` and `before` variables are not accurately capturing the intended logic.

To fix the bug, the `before` variable should be constrained by the `max_allowed` value, and the logic for returning `newlines` and `before` variables needs to be adjusted to return correct values based on the specific conditions outlined in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    # If it's a decorator, def or class
    if any(v for v in [current_line.is_decorator, current_line.is_def, current_line.is_class]):
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    # If it's a flow control
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    # If it's an import
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    # If it's a yield
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

The corrected function includes changes to correctly constrain the `before` variable based on the `max_allowed` value, and adjusts the logic for returning `newlines` and `before` variables based on the specific conditions within the function. This should ensure that the function passes the failing test cases and satisfies the expected input/output values.
