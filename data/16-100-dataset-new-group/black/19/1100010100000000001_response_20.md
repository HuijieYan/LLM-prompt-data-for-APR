## Analysis
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes a `current_line` as input and returns a tuple of two integers. The function analyzes the structure of the code and determines whether to insert empty lines before the current line. However, there are potential errors in the logic of the function that may lead to incorrect behavior.

## Potential Errors
1. Inconsistent handling of `max_allowed` based on the `depth` of the `current_line`.
2. Inconsistent updates to the variable `before`.
3. Use of `else` statement with conditionals that may lead to incorrect logic.
4. Incorrect return values for certain conditions.

## Bug Cause
The bug may be caused by inconsistent handling of the variables `max_allowed` and `before`, leading to incorrect identification of when to insert empty lines.

## Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the variable `max_allowed` is updated correctly based on the `depth` of the `current_line`.
2. Update the variable `before` consistently based on different conditions.
3. Refactor the conditionals and return statements to ensure correct logic and return values.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # Count the number of newlines before the first leaf
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    # Handle the depth of the current line
    depth = current_line.depth

    # Check if it's a decorator, def, or class
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)  # Update previous_defs
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines for special cases
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    # Check for flow control
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Check for imports and yields
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
