The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing a formatting error when comparing the expected and actual outputs, leading to the failing test with the given error message. The function is not handling the empty lines and prefixing properly, resulting in extra newlines being added or not being removed as expected.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic for handling `before` and `newlines` variables based on various line conditions.
2. The handling of `depth` and `previous_defs` while removing extra newlines.
3. The conditions for returning the number of empty lines and prefixes.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly removing or adding empty lines and prefixes according to the specific line conditions, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs. This leads to a failing test with an assertion error.

To fix the bug, we should carefully review the logic inside the function and ensure that the `before` and `newlines` variables are handled correctly, taking into account different line conditions and properly removing or adding empty lines and prefixes as needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    # Add a check to ensure proper handling of empty lines and prefixes
    if not current_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_def and not current_line.is_class:
        return before, 0

    return 0, 0
```

By explicitly adding a check to handle the situation when the line is neither a decorator, def, nor class, and returning the appropriate values for empty lines and prefixes, we can ensure that the function handles all line conditions correctly and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
