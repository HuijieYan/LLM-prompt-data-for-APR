The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears to have an issue where the value of `max_allowed` is not correctly determined and applied. This results in incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines to be inserted in certain scenarios.

The issue seems to be with the logic determining the value of `max_allowed` based on the depth of the `current_line`. The first if condition checks if `current_line.depth == 0`, and if true, sets `max_allowed` to `2`. However, it is not guaranteed that this will be the correct value for `max_allowed` in all scenarios.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to reconsider the conditions under which the value of `max_allowed` should change. It appears that `max_allowed` should depend on other factors rather than solely on the `current_line.depth`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        # Increase max_allowed based on certain conditions
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            max_allowed = 2
        else:
            max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the value of `max_allowed` is based on the presence of decorators, definitions, and classes, as well as the depth of the current line. These conditions should result in a more accurate determination of `max_allowed` and fix the bug.
