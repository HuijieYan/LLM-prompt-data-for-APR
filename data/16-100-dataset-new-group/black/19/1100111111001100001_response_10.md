Based on the provided buggy function and the failed test cases, it seems that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not handling certain branching logic properly. The function appears to be responsible for handling the insertion of empty line characters based on the type and depth of the current line and the previous line.

Upon analyzing the test cases, it is evident that the current implementation of `_maybe_empty_lines` is failing to account for certain conditions, leading to incorrect behavior. Some of the issues identified are related to the handling of decorators, imports, and yields, as well as incorrect handling of previous line type and depth checks.

To address the identified issues, it is recommended to modify the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to accurately account for the different line types and their interactions. Specifically, the branching conditions involving decorators, imports, yields, and line depths need to be revisited to reflect the expected behavior.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the identified issues:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditions involving decorators, imports, and yields have been revised to properly check for the presence of specific line types and depth levels. Additionally, the handling of previous line type and depth checks have been adjusted to ensure accurate behavior.

Please note that the provided corrected version might be a starting point for further refinement based on additional requirements or edge cases.
