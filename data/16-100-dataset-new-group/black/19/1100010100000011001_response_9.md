The bug was caused by the assignment of values to `max_allowed` and `before` outside of a condition that checks for `current_line.depth == 0`. This allowed for the erroneous values to be retained under certain conditions. So, the fix is to set `before` to 0 initially, and then perform specific conditional assignments based on `current_line` and `self.previous_line`. Additionally, the condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` is modified to include a check for `before` to handle the case when `before` is 0.
