The main issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it does not always return the expected value for the `newlines` and `before` variables. Looking at the input and expected output, it is clear that the function is determining the number of newlines for a given line based on specific conditions. However, due to inaccuracies in these conditions, the function is not always returning the correct result. The cause might be in the conditionals that check for certain properties of the `current_line` and `self.previous_line` objects. 

An example of incorrect output given by the failing test:
- Input: 
    - `current_line.depth` = 0
    - Previous line: `None`
- Expected Output:
    - `newlines` = 0
    - `before` = 0
- Actual Output:
    - `newlines` = 2
    - `before` = 1

Given these findings, a potential strategy for fixing the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is to review each conditional and ensure that the logic accurately reflects the expected behavior. This would involve carefully examining the properties of `current_line` and `self.previous_line` as well as the expected output for different scenarios. Once the faulty conditionals are identified, adjustments can be made to align the function's logic with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0 and current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 2
    elif current_line.depth == 0 and current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), 1)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and not current_line.is_import and self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

It's essential to carefully test the corrected function to ensure that it produces the expected output for various input scenarios. After thorough testing, it can be integrated back into the application codebase.
