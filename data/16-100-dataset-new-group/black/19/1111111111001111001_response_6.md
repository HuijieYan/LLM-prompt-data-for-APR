The bug with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it is not returning the expected empty lines values under certain conditions. While the expected values are not specified, it is clear that the logic and conditions in the function need to be revisited and corrected. The function should return the proper values based on the conditions specified.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to accurately determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on the conditions and input parameters. This requires understanding the specific cases and conditions under which the function should return the expected output.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the provided information:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Check if the line is a decorator
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return max_allowed, 0
    
    # Check if the line is a def or class
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            if current_line.depth == 0:
                self.previous_defs = [0]
            else:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            else:
                newlines = 2
                if current_line.depth:
                    newlines -= 1
                return newlines, 0
    
    # Check if the line is a flow control
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    # Check if the line is not an import and previous line was an import
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    
    # Check if the line is not a yield and previous line was a yield with different depth
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    
    # By default, return the calculated before value and 0
    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function should now return the expected number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the set conditions.

Please note that the corrected version is based on partial information from runtime and expected values. The exact conditions for determining the number of empty lines and specific expected values are not provided, so the logic may need further adjustment based on specific instructions.
