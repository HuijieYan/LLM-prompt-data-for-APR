The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that need to be fixed:

1. There are several methods called within the function such as `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, `current_line.is_class`, `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`, `self.previous_defs.pop()`, `self.previous_line.is_decorator`, `self.previous_line.is_import`, and `self.previous_line.is_yield` that are not defined within the given `Black` class. This can cause errors when calling these methods.

2. There is an issue with the logic in the function that is causing incorrect newlines to be inserted in the output.

3. The logic for handling comments within decorators, yield statements, and imports seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, we need to:
- Define the methods that are called within the `Black` class or ensure that they are properly defined and accessible.
- Correct the logic for inserting newlines based on different conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def() or current_line.is_class():
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control():
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have added parentheses `()` to the method calls such as `current_line.is_decorator()`, `current_line.is_def()`, and `current_line.is_class()` to ensure that they are properly called as methods. Additionally, we have added a check for `self.previous_line` before using it, and also modified the logic for handling different conditions to correctly insert newlines.
