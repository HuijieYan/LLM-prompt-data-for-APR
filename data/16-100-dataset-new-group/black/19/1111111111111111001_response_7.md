The bug in the function is causing discrepancies with the expected output. To address this, we need to update the function to rectify the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if len(current_line.leaves) > 0:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    if len(self.previous_defs) > 0:
        while self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = any(leaf.is_decorator for leaf in current_line.leaves)
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and any(leaf.is_decorator for leaf in current_line.leaves):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and any(leaf.is_import for leaf in self.previous_line.leaves) and not any(leaf.is_import for leaf in current_line.leaves) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and any(leaf.is_yield for leaf in self.previous_line.leaves) and (not any(leaf.is_yield for leaf in current_line.leaves) or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

You can use this corrected function to address the issue with the failing tests and ensure that correct output is generated.
