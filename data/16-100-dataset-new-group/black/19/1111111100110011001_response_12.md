The existing bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely causing it to return incorrect results, leading to an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual output. Given the expected input/output behaviors, the bug appears to be related to the logic of handling newlines, prefixes, and conditions related to `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.

One potential cause of the bug could be the inconsistent usage of variables related to newlines and depth, leading to incorrect calculations and comparisons. Additionally, the nested conditions for various properties such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, etc. might be incorrectly modifying the state of the method, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review and revise the logic for handling newlines, prefixes, and the conditions related to different property types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the expected input/output behaviors:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2

    before = self._consume_extra_newlines(current_line.leaves[0], max_allowed) if current_line.leaves else 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    # Check if the current line is a decorator, def or class
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self._update_previous_defs(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    # Check for flow control
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Check for imports and yields
    if (self.previous_line and
        self.previous_line.is_import and
        not current_line.is_import and
        depth == self.previous_line.depth) or \
       (self.previous_line and
        self.previous_line.is_yield and
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0

def _consume_extra_newlines(self, first_leaf: Leaf, max_allowed: int) -> int:
    before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
    first_leaf.prefix = ""
    return before

def _update_previous_defs(self, depth: int) -> None:
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
```

In the corrected version, we have split some of the logic into separate methods to improve readability and maintainability. We also ensured that the calculations for newlines and prefixes are handled consistently and accurately, addressing the potential issue that could lead to incorrect results. This function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
