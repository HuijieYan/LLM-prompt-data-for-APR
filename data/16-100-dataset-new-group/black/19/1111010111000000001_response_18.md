The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` which is causing the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is not implemented correctly.
2. The conditions for checking decorators, flow control, imports, and yields are causing unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for handling empty lines before and after the currently processed line is not properly accounting for different scenarios. Additionally, the conditions for checking decorators, flow control, imports, and yields are not correctly updating the number of empty lines.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be:
1. Rewriting the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line to be more accurate and aligned with the intended behavior of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. Adjusting the conditions for checking decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to ensure they correctly update the number of empty lines based on the context and previous lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return before, after

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return before, after

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        before = 1

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (
        not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        before = 1

    return before, after
```

In the corrected version, the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line has been simplified and restructured based on the intended behavior. The conditions for checking decorators, flow control, imports, and yields have been adjusted to correctly update the variables `before` and `after` based on the context and previous lines.
