The `maybe_empty_lines` function is used to determine the formatting of empty lines in a Python file being formatted. However, there are a few issues with the logic in the function that need to be addressed.

1. The function contains multiple references to `current_line`. However, you have not defined the `Line` class or the `Leaf` class. These classes are being used in the function, so it's crucial to properly define them and include them in the function.

2. The function has several conditions and comparisons based on `current_line`, `previous_line`, and their attributes like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. Without the proper definition of these attributes and classes, the comparisons and conditions will fail.

3. The usage of `if self.previous_line is None:` should ideally be checked after verifying if `self.previous_line` exist to avoid errors.
   
A strategy to fix the bug would involve:

- Defining the classes and attributes that are being used within the function.
- Ensuring that all the comparisons and conditions are valid by providing the necessary definitions.

Here's a corrected version of the `maybe_empty_lines` function after assuming relevant classes are provided:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def() or current_line.is_class():
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is not None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control():
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version:
- The `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` functions are being called with the appropriate parenthesis to invoke them as methods instead of attributes.
- Checks for `self.previous_line` are verified before using it to avoid NoneType errors.
