The buggy function is designed to handle empty lines in Python code and return the number of empty lines to be added before and after the current line. However, the function contains several potential issues where it may fail to return the expected values. 

First, the function uses a condition block to update the `max_allowed` variable based on the value of `current_line.depth`. This change should be reflected in all subsequent segments involving `max_allowed`.

Second, within the first `if` block, the variable `self.previous_defs` is being modified through the `pop` function. When this variable is later modified within the block following this `if` statement, it should be handled carefully to ensure consistency.

Third, the conditional statements contain complex logical relationships between the variables such as `is_decorator`, `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `depth`. The handling of these conditional statements may lead to incorrect return values for the function.

To address these issues, the potential solution is to carefully revise the logical flow and conditional checks to ensure that the correct values are assigned to the variables. Furthermore, tracking the state of the class's internal variables throughout the function's execution is necessary to ensure consistent behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_import_check = self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if is_import_check and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version, the conditional statements have been simplified to ensure that the state of the variables is correctly evaluated to return the expected values. Additionally, the modifications made to the class's internal variables are managed consistently to avoid unexpected behavior. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
