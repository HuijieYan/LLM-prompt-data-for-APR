The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be that the return values are incorrect for many of the conditions being checked. The cases where previous line is not None and the current line is a decorator, `def`, or `class` and the previous line was a decorator are not being handled correctly. Additionally, the cases for flow control, import, and yield are also not returning the correct values.

The strategy to fix the bug is to carefully analyze each condition and ensure that the correct values are being returned based on the input parameters and other relevant variables in the program. It may also be necessary to adjust the conditions themselves to account for all possible scenarios.

Here is an attempt to fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, various checks and conditions have been modified to return the correct values based on the input parameters and other relevant variable values. It also incorporates better handling of different scenarios to ensure correctness.
