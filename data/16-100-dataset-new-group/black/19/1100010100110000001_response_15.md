The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is causing an issue with the formatting of the output. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be added before the current line based on various conditions.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The condition `if current_line.depth == 0` might not be handling the case properly.
- Modifying `before` variable inside the while loop might lead to unexpected results.
- The logic for determining the number of empty lines based on different conditions might not be accurate.

Cause of the bug:
The function is not handling the indentation and empty lines before the current line accurately, resulting in incorrect formatting.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the condition `if current_line.depth == 0` is handled properly.
2. Evaluate the logic inside the while loop to correctly determine the value of `before`.
3. Review the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on different conditions to ensure accuracy.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    initial_before = before  # Store the initial value of before

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = initial_before  # Restore the initial value of before if necessary

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function takes into account the initial value of `before` and restores it after the while loop. Additionally, the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on different conditions has been reviewed to ensure accuracy.
