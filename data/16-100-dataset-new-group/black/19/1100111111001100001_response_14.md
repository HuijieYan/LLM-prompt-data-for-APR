The cause of the bug:
The issue with the code appears to be a logical inconsistency between the conditions and operations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. In each case, the variables `max_allowed`, `before`, `depth`, and `is_decorator` appear to affect the return values differently, leading to an undesired outcome.

# Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Update the logic inside the function `_maybe_empty_lines` to ensure that the variables `max_allowed`, `before`, `depth`, and `is_decorator` are correctly applied to generate the correct number of newlines and a boolean flag for insertion.

2. Consider refactoring the conditions and assignments within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the correct number of newlines and the boolean flag is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By using the updated code provided above, the issue within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be resolved.
