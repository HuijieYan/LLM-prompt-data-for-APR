## Buggy Function Analysis

The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It is used to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function starts by setting `max_allowed` to 1, then checks if the `current_line.depth` is 0 and updates `max_allowed` to 2 accordingly. Based on various conditions related to the content and structure of the `current_line`, the function computes and returns the number of empty lines required before and after the line.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not producing the correct output, leading to a failed assertion. There are multiple potential error locations within the function:
1. Handling of the `bleaves` attribute of `current_line` may not be functioning correctly.
2. Possible incorrect updating of the `self.previous_defs` list.
3. Mishandling of cases based on the attributes of `current_line` such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.

The expected input/output values are provided for 8 different cases, detailing the expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return for each case. This gives a comprehensive understanding of the expected behavior in various scenarios.


## Bug in the Function
The bug in the function is caused by incorrect handling of various conditions and attributes of the `current_line`. This leads to incorrect computation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the line. As a result, the function fails to produce the expected output, leading to a failed test assertion.


## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the various conditions and attributes of the `current_line`. This involves ensuring that it correctly updates the `max_allowed` value, handles the `bleaves` attribute of `current_line` appropriately, and maintains the `self.previous_defs` list based on the depth of the lines processed.


## Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected function addresses the issues with handling `current_line.leaves`, updating `max_allowed`, and maintaining `self.previous_defs` based on the depth of the lines processed. It should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
