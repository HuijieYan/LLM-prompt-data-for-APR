Here is the corrected version of the buggy `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        empty_lines_before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if first_leaf.prefix else 0

        if not current_line.depth:
            max_allowed = 2
        else:
            max_allowed = 1

        if empty_lines_before <= max_allowed:
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
            before = empty_lines_before
        else:
            before = max_allowed

        depth = current_line.depth

        if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
                self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        newlines = 0
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

        if not current_line.is_import:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                newlines = 0
            else:
                newlines = 1
        
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, before
```

The primary changes made to the function are:
1. Moved the check for `max_allowed` and `before` inside the if-else condition to handle the depth.
2. Removed unnecessary checks by updating the logic to have better flow and conditions.
3. Handled the counting of empty lines before the line.

This should resolve the issues in the previous implementation and allow the test case to pass.
