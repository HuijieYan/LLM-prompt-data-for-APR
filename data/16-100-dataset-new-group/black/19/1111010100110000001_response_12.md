The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines` and it is within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

The potential error locations in the function include the logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The logic for handling the `before` variable and the conditions for returning the number of newlines seem to be the main points of interest.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly computing the number of newlines needed before and after the currently processed line, leading to incorrect formatting of the output. This is evidenced by the AssertionError returned when running the test, which indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we should carefully review the logic for computing the number of newlines and its conditions. This includes the checks for various line types and the handling of the `before` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return 0, newlines

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I have adjusted the return statement for lines where a decorator, def, or class is encountered, as well as the handling of the `before` and `newlines` variables to reflect the intended logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
