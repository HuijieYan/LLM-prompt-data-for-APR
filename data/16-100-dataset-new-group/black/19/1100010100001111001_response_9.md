The bug present in the provided function '_maybe_empty_lines' is that the variable 'newlines' is not being returned as a Tuple as specified in the return type of the function. Additionally, the 'newlines' value is only being computed for specific cases and should be computed for all cases.

Furthermore, it is unclear why the 'self.previous_defs' value is being set to [0] in the expected case 7. Since it does not match the runtime input/output values or the expected input/output values, this assignment is considered inappropriate.

An appropriate fix for this bug would include ensuring that 'newlines' is computed for all cases, and the return statement should return both new values for 'before' and 'newlines'. Additionally, it would also involve addressing the incorrect assignment of 'self.previous_defs'.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return before, newlines

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
