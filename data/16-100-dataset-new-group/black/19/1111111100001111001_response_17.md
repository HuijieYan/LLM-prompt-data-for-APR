The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be related to the handling of newlines and the logic for consuming them and updating their count. It also seems to be related to the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Given the analysis of the bug, it's suggested that the strategy for fixing the bug would involve rewriting the logic for consuming newlines, updating their count, and inserting empty lines based on the current and previous lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    newlines_before = 0
    newlines_after = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return newlines_before, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return newlines_before, newlines_after

        newlines_after = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines_before, newlines_after

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        newlines_before = 1
        return newlines_before, newlines_after

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        newlines_before = 1
        return newlines_before, newlines_after

    return 0, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for consuming newlines and inserting empty lines has been restructured and improved. The conditions for different line types have been updated to handle the insertion of newlines more accurately.
