The bug in the given function is likely due to incorrect manipulation of the `before` variable, which represents the number of potential extra empty lines needed before the currently processed line. The `before` variable is modified in the function based on different code block conditions, but these modifications may not accurately reflect the intended logic.

Here are the potential issues in the function:

1. Incorrectly resetting the `before` variable within the while loop: The while loop logic involving `previous_defs` and the depth of the current line may not be correctly handling the resetting of the `before` variable. The logic in the while loop might be resetting `before` incorrectly to 1 or 2 based on certain conditions.

2. Misinterpretation of the current line's attributes: The conditionals that check whether the current line is a decorator, def, class, flow control, or import and yield statements might not be evaluated correctly, leading to incorrect computation of `newlines`.

3. Unclear logic related to the state and transition of previous lines: The function makes reference to the `previous_line` and `previous_defs` attributes, and it is not entirely clear how these attributes are expected to behave and how they relate to the computation of `before` and `newlines`.

To fix the bug, it is essential to review and refine the logic for handling newlines and empty lines before and after a line. We can consider refactoring this complex logic into separate methods with clear responsibilities for improved readability and maintainability.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with updated logic:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the refactored version, we have simplified the conditional statements and handled the computation of `max_allowed` and `before` based on the current line's attributes and depth. This refactoring reduces the complexity and improves the readability of the function.

Additionally, it's important to call this function with the correct parameters and handle the return values as needed based on its usage within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
