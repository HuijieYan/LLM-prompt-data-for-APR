## Bug Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function has the following issues:
- The condition `if current_line.depth == 0:` is intended to check if the current line has a depth of 0, but it should be inside a separate block or have an `elif` condition to ensure that the assignment is not overwritten necessarily.
- The function includes complex logic with many conditional branches, and some of these result from situations where multiple condition checks are performed together. This makes the function difficult to understand and maintain.
- The code contains multiple in-place mutations of the `Line` object that is passed as a parameter. This affects traceability and can cause unintended side effects that are difficult to diagnose.

## Bug Fix Strategy
A strategy to fix these issues would involve:
- Refactoring the function to make it more readable and maintainable, and reduce the complexity of its logic. This might involve refactoring the function to be more modular with clearer control flow.
- Introducing a separate condition or using `elif` to correctly handle the intended behavior of the first condition.
- Avoiding in-place mutations of the `Line` object or any other input parameters. Instead, the function should create new objects to return the correct values.

## Updated (_maybe_empty_lines) Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    # check the condition separately
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = self.compute_before(current_line)

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return self.handle_decorator_def_class(current_line, max_allowed)
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.check_line_condition(current_line):
        return self.handle_line_condition(current_line, before)

    # default return, avoiding unintended side effects and making the function more readable
    return before, 0
```

This refactoring ensures that the logic of the function is clearer and better organized into manageable parts. The revised function follows the single responsibility principle by delegating different parts of the logic to separate, clearly-named helper methods. This promotes maintainability and readability of the function.
