Based on the provided information, it appears that the cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the computation of the variable `before`. The logic for limiting `before` to `max_allowed` is incorrect, and it affects the number of empty lines to be returned before the current line. After analyzing the runtime values and types, it is clear that the logic for determining the number of empty lines is faulty.

A more appropriate strategy for fixing the bug could be to introduce new variables to properly handle the calculation for `before` and modify the conditional logic to accurately return the number of empty lines. Additionally, it is essential to consider the conditions for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` in determining the number of empty lines to be returned. Lastly, the logic for tracks of previous definitions needs to be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles the indentation depth.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    if current_line.depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        self.previous_defs = [d for d in self.previous_defs if d < current_line.depth]

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
