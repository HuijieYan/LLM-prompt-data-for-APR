The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function causes the incorrect calculation of the newlines before and after the currently processed line. The issue is related to incorrect handling of the `depth` variable and improper updates to the `previous_defs` and the newline variables.

To fix the bug, first, use the current line's depth to determine the `max_allowed` newlines. Then, handle the previous definitions correctly and use the `depth` variable to update the `before` newline value. Also, consider the specific conditions in the code and ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: black.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    # The corrected function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

With these corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
