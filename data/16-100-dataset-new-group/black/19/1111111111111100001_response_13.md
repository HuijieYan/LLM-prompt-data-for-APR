The bug in the provided function lies in the logic that determines the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The `max_allowed` value is not being set correctly. Also, when checking for specific attributes of the `current_line`, the logic seems to be inconsistent and is not producing the expected results when comparing `self.previous_line` and `current_line` attributes. 

The `max_allowed` value is not being set correctly based on the condition `if current_line.depth == 0`. Additionally, the logic to check for attributes such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, and others, seems to produce incorrect results when comparing `self.previous_line` and `current_line` attributes.

To fix this bug, the condition `if current_line.depth == 0` should correctly set the `max_allowed` value. The logic for checking various attributes like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, etc., should be re-evaluated to produce the correct return values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    if len(self.previous_defs) > 0 and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the `max_allowed` value is being set correctly based on the condition `if current_line.depth == 0`, and the logic for checking various attributes has been reassessed and modified to produce the expected return values.
