The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely due to the manipulation of the `before` variable, as well as the manipulation of the `first_leaf`'s `prefix`. It also seems that there's an issue with the condition checks regarding the previous lines and decorators.

The function should compute the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the current line. To fix this bug, first, reinitialize the `before` variable inside each conditional block. Then, make sure to remove unwanted mutations of the input object `current_line`. Finally, adjust the conditional checks based on the requirements provided in the `EmptyLineTracker` class docstring.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0  # reinitialize before inside the function

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        if first_leaf.prefix:
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf = first_leaf._replace(prefix='')

    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    else:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    if depth == 0:
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.depth > 0 and (current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class):
        return 1, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function better aligns with the requirements specified in the `EmptyLineTracker` class docstring. It reinitializes the `before` variable as required, removes unwanted mutations of the `current_line` object, and adjusts the conditional checks to properly calculate the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the current line.
