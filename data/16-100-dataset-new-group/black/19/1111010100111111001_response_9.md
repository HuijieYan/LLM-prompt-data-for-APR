The issue with the buggy function identified is related to the calculation of the before and newlines values. The code logic doesn't accurately account for the specific cases when to insert empty lines before and after the processed line.

The specific issues within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The code doesn't properly handle certain conditions for when to insert empty lines before and after the processed line. This results in incorrect before and newlines values being returned.
2. There are inconsistencies in processing certain elements such as decorators, imports, and yield, which affect the logic for calculating newlines.

To fix these issues, the logic for handling different cases, such as decorators, imports, and yield, needs to be reviewed. Additionally, a more structured approach is needed to set the before and newlines values based on these cases.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return 2 - min(1, depth), 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for determining before and newlines values is restructured to handle different cases more accurately. Additionally, the comparison with previous lines and conditions for inserting empty lines is revised. With these modifications, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
