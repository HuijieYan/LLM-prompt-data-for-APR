The potential location of the error in the _maybe_empty_lines function is the conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines to be returned. The cause of the bug may be the incorrect handling of the conditions and the logic for determining whether to insert empty lines.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the conditions and logic used to determine the number of empty lines to be returned based on the current line properties and the previous line properties. This involves adjusting the conditions and ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the specific cases outlined in the function.

Here is a corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        before = min(before, max_allowed)

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to be returned have been adjusted based on the requirements specified in the function. Specifically, the handling of the maximum allowed empty lines, consuming leaf extra newlines, and the conditions for different line properties have been updated to address the potential bug.
