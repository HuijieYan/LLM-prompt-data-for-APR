The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the initialization and handling of the `max_allowed` variable, as well as updating `before` inside the `while` loop. The function should correctly handle empty lines and prefixes for different line types, but in some cases, it is not updating `before` and `max_allowed` correctly, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

The `max_allowed` variable seems to be used to determine the maximum number of empty lines allowed, based on the depth of the current line. However, in the second if statement, `max_allowed` is conditionally updated to 2 when `current_line.depth` is 0, which causes the `max_allowed` value to remain set to 2 when it shouldn't.

The `before` variable also appears to be incorrectly updated inside the while loop, which could be causing unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `max_allowed` is updated properly based on `current_line.depth` and that `before` is set correctly inside the while loop. Also, we should check the conditions and calculations related to the return values to ensure they are correctly handling different line types.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else max_allowed

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the updated function, the conditions and update of `max_allowed` and `before` are fixed based on the analysis. This corrected version should address the issues and make the tests pass.
