The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic to determine the number of empty lines to return is incorrect. The function is designed to return a tuple containing the number of empty lines and the number of spaces to insert before the next line. However, the logic for this calculation is not handling all the cases correctly, leading to unexpected outputs.

To fix the bug, the following potential error locations can be identified:
1. The calculation of `before` and `newlines` within the function.
2. Conditions based on the type of the current line and some previous line properties.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be suggested to revise the conditional logic and the calculation of `before` and `newlines` based on the specific requirements of different scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0
    
    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This revised version addresses the issues by simplifying the calculations and adjusting the conditional statements based on the specific cases. It is designed to handle different scenarios and correctly determine the number of empty lines and spaces to insert before the next line.
