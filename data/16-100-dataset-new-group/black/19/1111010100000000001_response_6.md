The potential issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it is not returning the correct values based on the conditions and logic in the function. The function is intended to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, but it may not be doing so correctly due to conditional checks and variable assignments.

The cause of the bug can be identified from the conditional checks and the expected behavior documented in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function should consider all the conditions specified in the documentation and return the appropriate number of empty lines based on the current state and line type.

To fix the bug:
1. Review and update the conditional checks to ensure that all the edge cases and conditions are properly handled.
2. Adjust the variable assignments and returns to accurately reflect the intended behavior described in the class documentation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the function's conditional checks and return values align with the intended behavior of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and the `maybe_empty_lines()` method.
