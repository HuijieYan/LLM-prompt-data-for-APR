The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be having issues with correctly determining the number of newlines to insert based on the conditions provided. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to add before the next line based on the current line and the previous lines.

Based on the function and its related functions, the potential error locations are in the conditional statements and the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to insert.

The cause of the bug is likely the incorrect evaluation of conditions and the incorrect calculation of the number of newlines to insert based on various scenarios.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to carefully analyze each conditional statement and ensure that the logic for determining the number of empty lines is correct. Additionally, the usage of related functions such as `is_import`, `is_decorator`, `is_yield`, etc. should be checked to ensure they are providing the correct information.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditional logic and the calculation of newlines have been adjusted to address the potential issues. Additionally, the usage of related functions and conditions have been re-evaluated to ensure they provide the correct information for determining the number of empty lines to insert.
