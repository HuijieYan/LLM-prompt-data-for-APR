The bug in this function seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The code has several conditional checks that determine the number of empty lines and there are multiple return statements based on these conditions.

Potential error locations:
1. The logic used to determine the number of empty lines before and after the line.
2. Condition checking for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.
3. Accessing and modifying values of `current_line`, `self`, and `self.previous_line`.

Given the expected input/output values, it looks like the bug is causing incorrect values to be returned for the number of empty lines needed before and after the line in various cases.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the line needs to be carefully reviewed and modified. It seems that the conditional checks and the logic within each condition may need to be updated based on the expected values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the potential issues identified and should now pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
