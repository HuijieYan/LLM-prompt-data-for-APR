## Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be responsible for formatting the output of the test, leading to the `AssertionError`.

The function checks the conditions of the current_line and the previous_line to determine the number of empty lines to be added. However, the logic for determining the number of empty lines seems to be incorrect.

## Bug
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could be in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be added based on the current line and the previous line. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the logic to determine the number of empty lines.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Analyze the logic used in the conditionals and verify if it correctly determines the number of empty lines to be added.
2. Check if the conditional checks for the current line and the previous line are implemented correctly.
3. Verify if the depth of the current line and the previous line is used appropriately to determine the number of empty lines.
4. Ensure that the conditions for different types of lines (import, yield, def, flow control, decorator, etc.) are handled correctly to determine the number of empty lines.

## The corrected version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
        and not current_line.is_import(self)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
        and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, issues related to determining the number of empty lines based on the current line and the previous line have been addressed. The checks for import and yield have been updated based on the correct conditions using the related functions. Furthermore, the conditions for decorator and the correct conditions for not adding empty lines between decorators have been updated.
