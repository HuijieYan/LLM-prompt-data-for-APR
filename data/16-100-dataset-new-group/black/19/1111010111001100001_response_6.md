The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function should consider the `depth` and whether the line is a decorator, definition (def), class, flow control, import, or yield. The function calculates the number of empty lines incorrectly based on these conditions and assigns values to `newlines` and `before` variables incorrectly.

The bug can be fixed by refactoring the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to consider the conditions and input parameters correctly and calculate the expected number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 1, 0
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif current_line.is_import:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_yield:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        return 0, 0
    else:
        return 0, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function checks the condition for each type of line and calculates the number of empty lines accordingly. This refactoring ensures that the logic of the function aligns with the expected behavior based on the input parameters and conditions provided.

By using this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
