The bug occurs within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is intended to return a tuple of integers representing the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function contains several conditional statements to determine the values of the two elements of the tuple based on various conditions related to the current line and the previous line.

The conditional statements are intricate and involve multiple factors, such as `depth`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. However, based on the input and expected outcomes provided, it seems that the conditional logic is incorrect and is not producing the expected results.

One notable issue in this buggy function is the inconsistent usage with the variable `newlines`. In the branching logic of the function, `newlines` is defined but not consistently returned or updated. 

To address the bug, a more systematic and structured approach to handling the logic of setting the `newlines` variable and modifying `before` is needed.

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below, taking into consideration the factors that determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This version addresses inconsistencies and optimizes the conditional logic to achieve the desired behavior based on the input and expected outcomes.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        else:
            if current_line.depth:
                return 1, 0
            else:
                return 2, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import 
            and not current_line.is_import 
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield 
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```
By implementing the suggested changes, the conditional logic should now cover the cases provided. Testing is advised to ensure the correct behavior of the function.
