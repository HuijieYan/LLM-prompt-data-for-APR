This function is meant to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are several issues present in the current implementation:

1. `self.previous_defs` is used without being defined within the function.
2. `self.previous_line` is used without being defined within the function.
3. The conditions for checking `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, `current_line.is_class`, and `current_line.is_flow_control` are not defined within the function.
4. The `Leaf` and `Line` classes are not defined, so it's not possible to infer the complete behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

To fix these issues, start by defining the necessary variables and classes within the function or passing them as arguments to the function. Additionally, define the conditions necessary to check the attributes of the `current_line` object. Here's a modified version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line, previous_defs: List[int], previous_line: Optional[Line]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while previous_defs and previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = is_decorator(current_line)  # Assuming is_decorator is a function to check if it's a decorator
    if is_decorator or is_def(current_line) or is_class(current_line):
        if not is_decorator:
            previous_defs.append(depth)
        if previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if previous_line and is_decorator(previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if is_flow_control(current_line):
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        previous_line
        and is_import(previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        previous_line
        and is_yield(previous_line)
        and (not is_yield(current_line) or depth != previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In this fixed version, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` now receives `current_line`, `previous_defs`, and `previous_line` as parameters. Additionally, the conditions for attributes like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` are replaced with function calls to check those attributes.
