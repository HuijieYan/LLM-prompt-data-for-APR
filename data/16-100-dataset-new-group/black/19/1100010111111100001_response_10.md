From analysing the buggy function and the failing test, we can deduce that the bug likely stems from the logic where the values of `before` and `newlines` are computed. The return statement for these values may also be incorrectly handling different conditions, resulting in discrepancies in the output when compared to the expected values from the failing test.

The bug is likely causing the function to return incorrect values for the number of newlines and leading spaces before a line, leading to a formatting inconsistency between the expected and actual outputs.

To fix the bug, we should examine the logic used to calculate the `before` and `newlines` variables. We should also carefully consider the conditions under which these variables are modified and the corresponding return statements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth) or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the initial assignment of `max_allowed` to consider the depth of the current line. Additionally, the condition for returning newlines has been revised to match the expectations from the failing test. We have also removed unnecessary lines and improved code readability.
