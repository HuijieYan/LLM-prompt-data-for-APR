The bug in the provided function is related to the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines that need to be added before the current line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes as input the current line and some context variables and is supposed to return the number of empty lines that should be added before the current line, as well as a boolean flag indicating whether a newline should be added after the current line.

Based on the given runtime values of the input parameters and variables at the return of the function, the function logic seems to be flawed in some conditional branches, leading to incorrect calculation and return of the values for empty lines and the boolean flag.

The key potential error locations are identified in the conditional blocks where the function calculates the number of empty lines and the boolean flag based on the context variables and previous line properties.

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of cases where the function checks the properties of the current line against the previous line. In some of these checks, the conditional logic is incorrect, leading to incorrect conclusions about whether to add empty lines or not.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should be carefully reviewed and corrected based on the context variables and the properties of the current and previous lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statements have been reviewed and updated to ensure that the correct logic is applied to determine the number of empty lines to be added and the boolean flag for adding a newline after the current line. This corrected version should address the bug in the original function and provide the expected behavior.
