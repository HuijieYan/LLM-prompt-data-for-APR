The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is attempting to handle empty lines within the Python source code. However, there are several issues with the way the attempts are being made:

1. The condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` does not make logical sense. It seems like the intent is to set `before` to 1 if depth is truthy, and 2 otherwise. However, this is not a meaningful way to handle depth. It seems like it should be just `before = max_allowed`.

2. The handling of `self.previous_defs` and `depth` seems incorrect. Based on the context, it looks like the intention may be to check whether the depth is non-zero in order to adjust the number of newlines, but the logic is not clear and might be incorrect.

To fix these issues, we can:

1. Update the logic for setting the value of `before`.
2. Revise the handling of `self.previous_defs` and `depth` in a way that makes sense for the intended behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version:
1. The calculation of `before` has been updated.
2. The mechanism of handling `self.previous_defs` and `depth` has been adjusted to better match the expected behavior.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
