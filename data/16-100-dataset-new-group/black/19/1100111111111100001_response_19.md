The buggy function is supposed to adjust the number of empty lines to be inserted before a line of code based on various conditions. However, it fails to do so and produces incorrect results, as evidenced by the failing test cases.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the logic for handling different cases at the end of the function before the return statement.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the logic for adjusting the number of empty lines before a line of code is incorrect due to the conditions not being handled properly based on the input parameters.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling different cases at the end of the function needs to be reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is determined based on the specified conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, before), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, before), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the conditions for handling the number of empty lines before a line of code based on various criteria and should pass the failing test cases.
