The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple conditional statements, where the values of `before` and `newlines` can be determined based on the conditions. The issue arises when assigning values to `before` and `newlines` throughout the function. In each case, there is a direct assignment of new values to `before` and `newlines`, causing some logic errors.

The main issue in the function is the inappropriate overwriting of `before` and `newlines` in various blocks, which leads to incorrect values. These incorrect values are then returned and cause the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to rethink the strategy for conditional value assignments. Instead of repeatedly overwriting the `before` and `newlines` variables, consider using specific conditions to adjust the value incrementally. This way, the correct values will accumulate through the conditional blocks and result in the expected output.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            if depth == 0:
                before = 2
            else:
                before = 1
            self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```
In this fixed version of the function, the `before` and `newlines` are assigned values only when their conditions are met. This allows the correct values to be accumulated through the conditional blocks and returned as expected.
