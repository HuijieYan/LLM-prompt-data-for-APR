The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is causing the test `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail. The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output, specifically when dealing with comments, decorators, and properties.

The bug seems to be related to the logic for handling comments, decorators, and properties in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. It is likely that the function is not correctly identifying the presence of comments or decorators and adjusting newlines accordingly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle comments, decorators, and properties, ensuring that the number of newlines before and after these elements is calculated accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly checks for imports using the `is_import` function, and also checks for decorators and other conditions that affect the number of newlines to be inserted before and after the current line.

By ensuring that the logic for handling comments, decorators, and properties is accurate in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the failing test should now pass.
