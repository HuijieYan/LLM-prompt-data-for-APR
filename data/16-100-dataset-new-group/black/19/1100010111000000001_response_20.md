The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple potential error locations. However, the cause of the bug may be related to incorrect conditions and return values, as well as issues with how the function handles different types of lines (decorators, flow control, imports, yield statements, etc.).

The strategy for fixing the bug involves carefully analyzing the conditions and return values in the function to ensure that it correctly handles different types of lines and situations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return (0, 0)

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return (0, 0)

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return (newlines, 0)

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return (before, 1)

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return ((before or 1), 0)

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return ((before or 1), 0)

    return (before, 0)
```

In the corrected version, the conditions and return values have been adjusted to ensure that the function correctly handles different scenarios based on the type of line being processed. Some comparisons and conditions have been fixed to ensure that the correct values are returned based on the logic of the function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
