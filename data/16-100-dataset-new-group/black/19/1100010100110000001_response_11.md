Upon analysis, the bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is likely to be related to the handling of empty lines and formatting issues between statements. The error message indicates an assertion failure between the expected and actual output from the `assertFormatEqual` function. This suggests that there might be an issue with the generation of empty lines and formatting within the function.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be:
1. Improper handling of empty lines for certain types of lines.
2. Incorrect logic for adding or removing empty lines between different types of lines.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect logic for adding or removing empty lines. This could result in incorrect spacing between statements and could lead to assertion failures in the tests.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review and modify the logic for handling empty lines based on different types of lines and their contexts. Additionally, ensuring consistency in adding or removing empty lines based on specific conditions will help in generating correct formatting.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adding or removing empty lines based on specific conditions has been carefully reviewed and modified to ensure correct and consistent formatting between different types of lines. This version should pass the failing test.
