## Analysis
This function is supposed to return a tuple of integers, but there are multiple conditional statements that could potentially cause the function to return incorrect or unexpected values. The condition checks and assignments are not being handled properly.

## Errors
1. The condition checks for `is_decorator`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` seem to be incorrect and may lead to incorrect return values.
2. There are multiple inconsistent assignments to the `newlines` variable.
3. The handling of `before` and `newlines` is not consistent across different conditions.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks and assignments are not being handled consistently and accurately. This has led to unexpected or incorrect return values for the function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Review the conditional checks to ensure they are accurate and cover all necessary cases.
2. Reassign the variables `newlines` and `before` consistently to ensure a correct return value.

    if current_line.leaves:

        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = 0 if before < max_allowed else max_allowed
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

        before = 0
