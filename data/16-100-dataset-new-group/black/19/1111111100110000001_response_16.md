The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have an issue with handling the insertion of empty lines in the code. The function is used to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It makes decisions based on various conditions such as the depth of the current line, the presence of leaves, the type of the current line, and the properties of the previous line.

One potential error location in the function is the conditional statements that determine when to return the number of newlines. The function tries to handle multiple scenarios and conditions for inserting empty lines, which may lead to incorrect decisions.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected and actual outputs of the test are not equal. This could be due to the incorrect insertion of empty lines as a result of the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function need to be carefully reviewed and revised to ensure that the correct logic is applied for handling empty lines in different scenarios. Additionally, the function should be thoroughly tested with various input cases to ensure that it produces the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0
    
    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version simplifies the conditional logic and properly handles the insertion of empty lines based on the type and depth of the current line, as well as the properties of the previous line. After making these changes, the function should be thoroughly tested with different scenarios to ensure it produces the correct output.
