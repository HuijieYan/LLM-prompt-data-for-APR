The cause of the issue seems to stem from the handling of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The code performs several computations and checks based on the properties of the current line and the previous lines. The issue may be related to the logic used in determining the number of empty lines to insert.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to closely analyze the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the line, and ensure that the correct conditions are being evaluated and correctly handled to avoid any unnecessary insertion of extra empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed_before = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed_before = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed_before)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 0
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        return 0, newlines

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield and current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for computing the number of empty lines to insert before and after the line has been modified to better handle the different cases based on the current line and previous lines. This should address the issues observed in the failing tests while also ensuring the correct computation of empty lines based on the conditions provided.
