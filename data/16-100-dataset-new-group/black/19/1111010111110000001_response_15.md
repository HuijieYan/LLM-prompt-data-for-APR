The error in the `maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class is causing a failure in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test. The error message shows that the expected and actual outputs do not match, indicating a problem with empty lines in decorators and comments.

The cause of the bug could be related to the handling of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. It seems that the function is not correctly determining the number of extra empty lines needed in certain cases, especially when dealing with decorators and comments.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line needs to be carefully reviewed and adjusted based on the specific conditions and context.

Here is the corrected version of the `maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (1 if current_line.prefix else 0), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    # Default case
    return (1 if current_line.prefix else 0), 0
```
In the corrected version, the logic for handling decorators, flow control, imports, yields, and the default case has been adjusted to ensure the correct determination of empty lines. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
