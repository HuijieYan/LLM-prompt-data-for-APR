The bug in the provided code occurs in the return statements where the calculated values do not match the expected output when tested. The logic implemented in the _maybe_empty_lines function is incorrect and needs to be modified to ensure that it returns the correct values for the given input.

To fix the bug, I suggest checking each of the conditions for adding empty lines and ensuring the correct value is returned based on the condition. Additionally, the prefix of the first leaf should be adjusted to reflect the consumed state of newlines.

Here is the corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
  max_allowed = 1
  if current_line.depth == 0:
      max_allowed = 2
      
  if current_line.leaves:
      # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
      first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
      before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
      before = min(before, max_allowed)
      first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.replace("\n", "", before)
  else:
      before = 0
  
  is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
  if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
      if not is_decorator:
          self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

      if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
          return 0, 0
      else:
          newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
          return newlines, 0

  if current_line.is_flow_control:
      return before, 1

  if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
      return max(before, 1), 0

  if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
      return max(before, 1), 0

  return before, 0
```

This corrected version should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test cases will pass.
