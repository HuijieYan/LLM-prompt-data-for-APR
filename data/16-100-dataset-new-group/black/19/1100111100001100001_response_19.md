The issue with the function appears to be in the handling of the `max_allowed` variable and its subsequent use to modify `before`. 

Based on the runtime input/output scenarios, it seems that `max_allowed` is assigned a value based on a condition, and then that value is meant to be used to limit the value of `before`. However, in some cases, the value of `before` is not being correctly adjusted based on the value of `max_allowed`, leading to unexpected results.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the value of `before` is correctly modified based on `max_allowed`. Additionally, we should ensure that the conditions and assignments related to `max_allowed` and `before` are correctly evaluated.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before if before <= max_allowed else max_allowed), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before if before <= max_allowed else max_allowed), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I ensured that the `before` variable is properly adjusted based on the value of `max_allowed` in the relevant cases. Specifically, I used `before if before <= max_allowed else max_allowed` to make sure that `before` does not exceed the `max_allowed` value. This should prevent unexpected behavior and resolve the issues observed in the failing test cases.
