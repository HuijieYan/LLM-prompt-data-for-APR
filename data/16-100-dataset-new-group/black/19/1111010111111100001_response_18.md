The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect calculation of empty lines both before and after the currently processed line. This results in the incorrect number of newlines being returned, leading to the failing test cases.

The issue arises from the incorrect handling of empty lines in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, specifically with the logic around the `before` and `newlines` variables.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves adjusting the conditional logic for calculating the number of empty lines based on different line types and restructuring the logic for handling `before` and `newlines`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(len(first_leaf.prefix) - len(first_leaf.prefix.lstrip('\n')), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.lstrip('\n')
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the conditional logic and handles the calculation of empty lines more accurately based on different line types and previous line conditions. It also ensures that the correct number of newlines is returned as expected by the tests.
