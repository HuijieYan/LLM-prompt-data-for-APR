The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not adding the correct number of empty lines in certain cases, causing a test to fail. The error message from the failing test indicates that the actual output is missing empty lines compared to the expected output.

Upon analyzing the function, potential error locations are identified in the conditional branches where the number of empty lines is returned.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in certain scenarios, resulting in the mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to carefully review each conditional branch and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# The corrected version of the function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 1  # Fixed: return the correct number of empty lines in the default case
```

By correcting the conditional branches and ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is returned in each case, the updated function should now pass the failing test.
