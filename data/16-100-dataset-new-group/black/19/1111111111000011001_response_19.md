The bug seems to be occurring within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, and it appears to be related to the `first_leaf` and `is_decorator` variables. The bug may be causing incorrect conditions to be met, leading to unexpected values of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines`, which are crucial to the return values. A potential strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing the conditions that determine the values of these variables, verifying that they align with the expected behavior, and ensuring that the correct values are assigned to `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` based on the input parameters.

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:  # Changed condition
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditions and variable assignments have been reviewed and adjusted based on the expected behavior for the input parameters. The corrections include updating the relevant conditions, handling the `self.previous_line` condition, and ensuring that the correct values are assigned to `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` before the return statement. These adjustments are made in alignment with the information provided about the expected input/output values and the failing test cases.
