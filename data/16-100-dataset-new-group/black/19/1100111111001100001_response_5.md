The bug seems to be caused by incorrect behavior in handling newlines and depth of code elements. In the given test cases, the code elements differ in their characteristics such as decorators and flow controls. The _maybe_empty_lines function incorrectly assigns newlines and other parameters based on these characteristics, leading to incorrect output. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the logic of calculating newlines and other parameters based on the characteristics of the code elements, considering the different possible cases of current_line and self.previous_line combinations.

Here's the updated and corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not current_line.leaves:
        return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines for blank lines
    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines for decorators

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1  # Insert empty lines after flow control statements

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines after decorators
        depth = current_line.depth
        if depth > self.previous_defs[-1]:  # Increase empty lines for higher indentation
            return 0, depth - self.previous_defs[-1]
        return 0, 1  # Default behavior for def and class lines

    if current_line.is_import:
        if self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines for consecutive imports at the same depth
        return 1, 0  # Insert 1 empty line for imports

    if current_line.is_yield:
        if self.previous_line.is_yield and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines for consecutive yields at the same depth
        return 1, 0  # Insert 1 empty line for yield statements

    return 0, 0  # Default behavior for other cases
```

The corrected function is now updated to handle different cases such as decorators, flow control, def and class lines, imports, and yields separately while calculating the number of newlines and other parameters. This should address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
