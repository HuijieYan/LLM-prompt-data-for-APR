The bug is causing the returned `newlines` value to be 2, when it should only be 1 when `current_line.depth` is not `0`. This overlooks the possibility of indentation, resulting in unnecessary newlines before the function definition in the failing test case.

To fix this, we need to update the logic for calculating the appropriate number of newlines to add before the current line, which depends on whether the current line is a decorator, function definition, class definition, or import. We also should consider the indentation rules when determining the required number of newlines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if depth == 0 and not is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator) or (current_line.is_decorator):
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected number of newlines and handle the different types of lines appropriately, thus resolving the failing test cases.
