The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted based on various conditions. The function is attempting to handle indentation and grouping related to certain code structures like decorators, definitions, classes, imports, yield, and flow control.

The main issues observed are:
1. Inconsistent handling of `max_allowed` value when `current_line.depth` is `0`.
2. Deviating behavior based on the `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` attributes.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. To ensure the correct handling of `max_allowed` value, assign `max_allowed` to `2` at the beginning of the function, and then adjust it if `current_line.depth` is `0`.
2. Refactor the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted based on code structure conditions, such as decorators, definitions, classes, imports, yield, and flow control.

Below is a possible fix for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 3  # Adjusted based on the depth

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
This fix includes adjustments to the handling of conditions and variable assignments to ensure that the logic behaves correctly. However, further testing and validation are required to confirm this fix.
