## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs because the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not properly handling the logic for inserting empty lines before decorators and the first line in the file. The function does not return the expected values based on the current line attributes and the previous line's attributes.

The output variable `newlines` does not consider the condition for `is_decorator`, and the logic to insert empty lines before the first line in the file is not handled properly. The conditions for `current_line.is_decorator` and `self.previous_line` are not being checked correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. The logic for inserting empty lines before decorators and the first line in the file needs to be checked and handled correctly.
2. The conditions for `is_decorator` and `self.previous_line` should be accurately evaluated and appropriate return statements should be provided accordingly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line, previous_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth and self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator and (previous_line is None or previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 1
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines += 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (previous_line and previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (previous_line and previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function, the conditions for `is_decorator` and `self.previous_line` have been properly checked and handled for the return statements. Additionally, the logic for `newlines` has been updated considering both `is_decorator` and `current_line.depth` conditions.
