The bug seems to be caused by the function `_maybe_empty_lines` not properly handling the conditions to calculate the values of `newlines` and `before` based on different comparisons with the `current_line` object and the `self` object.

One potential cause of the bug is that the conditions in the function are not properly evaluating the cases for `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` while setting the values of `newlines` and `before`.

The method `_maybe_empty_lines` from the `EmptyLineTracker` class appears to handle the calculation of empty lines and is dependent on the state of different lines within the class, and leaf objects within those lines. It checks for the current line's attributes (`is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, for example) and uses these checks and the state of the object's previous lines to determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line.

Based on the descriptions and the test cases provided, the bug might be related to inaccuracies in the detection of specific line types and incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines required.

Based on the input parameters and the runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the function is not setting the values of `before` and `newlines` accurately based on conditions involving `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the conditions for `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` correctly and accurately calculates `before` and `newlines`.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # ... (rest of the code)

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, the conditions for `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` are correctly handled to calculate the values of `before` and `newlines` accurately based on the characteristics of the current and previous lines. This should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected in various test cases.
