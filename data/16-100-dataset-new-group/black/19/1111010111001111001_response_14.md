The problem in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it does not return the expected newlines. Based on the provided cases and their input and expected output values, it is clear that the while loop inside the function does not properly handle the return of `before` and `is_decorator` in all cases.

The fix should involve adjusting the logic inside the while loop to correctly return the `before` and `is_decorator` based on the conditions provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union
from my_module import Line

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2 - int(bool(current_line.depth))
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0

        return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
