The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing the `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail. After analyzing the bug, it seems that the issue arises from incorrect handling of empty lines in certain conditions, which leads to unexpected differences in the output. 

The section of code that seems to be causing the issue is:
```python
if current_line.is_flow_control:
    return before, 1

if (
    self.previous_line
    and self.previous_line.is_import
    and not current_line.is_import
    and depth == self.previous_line.depth
):
    return (before or 1), 0

if (
    self.previous_line
    and self.previous_line.is_yield
    and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
):
return (before or 1), 0
```

The issue is likely due to the logic within these conditions.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug is to review the conditions and logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, especially the conditions for determining whether to insert empty lines before or after a specific type of line. The faulty logic appears to be related to handling of `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, and `current_line.is_yield`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic within the conditional blocks has been reviewed and adjusted to handle the conditions for determining whether to insert empty lines before or after a specific type of line.

The corrected version should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` passes as expected.
