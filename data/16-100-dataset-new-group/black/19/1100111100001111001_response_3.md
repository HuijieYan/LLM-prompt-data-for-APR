The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be that the variable `newlines` is set to 2 in a branch of the code, but no value is being returned using the `newlines` variable at this point in the code. Instead, in the same branch, the function directly returns a tuple `(newlines, 0)`. This suggests that in the if-statement block where `newlines = 2`, the code is expected to return `(newlines, 0)`, but it should instead return just `newlines`. 

Additionally, the variable `before` is being unnecessarily set to 1 or 2 based on nested while conditions, which may be incorrect when the `while` loop block is executed. 

In light of these observations, fixing the bug will involve adjusting the return statements in the function and refactoring the while loop to correct the assignment of `before`. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that addresses the identified issue:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> int:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1)

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1)

    return before
```
