The code provided has issues that need to be addressed in order to fix the bug. We can follow these steps to correct the bug:

1. **Understanding the Bug**: By analyzing the runtime input/output values and the existing related functions in the code, we can have a better understanding of the issues causing the bug.
2. **Potential Error Locations**: The potential error locations seem to be around the conditions for setting `max_allowed`, handling `self.previous_defs`, and the subsequent conditional checks.
3. **Cause of the Bug**: The bug might be due to incorrect handling of previous definitions (`self.previous_defs`), and incorrect conditions for setting `before` and `newlines`.
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: We need to revisit the conditional checks, especially for setting `before` and `newlines`. Additionally, the handling of `self.previous_defs` seems to be incorrect, and we need to ensure its proper utilization.

With this information, we can incorporate the necessary changes to the buggy function and provide a corrected version.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Fix for handling previous_defs
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    else:
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
                not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
                (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return max(before, 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we made changes to condition checks to handle `self.previous_defs` appropriately, and we also made the conditional checks consistent. Additionally, we adjusted the `return` statements based on the conditions for `before` and `newlines`.

By incorporating these changes, we have addressed the identified issues and fixed the bug in the function.
