The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be due to incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The return statement in the current code is problematic and needs to be fixed.

The major issues identified are:
1. The logic to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line is convoluted and prone to errors.
2. Incorrect handling of the condition for decorators, yield statements, imports, and control flow statements.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve simplifying the logic for determining the number of empty lines and ensuring that each condition is properly checked.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    # Conditions for empty lines based on the type of line
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        # For decorators, definitions, and class declarations
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        # For flow control statements
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth:
        # For import statements
        return max_allowed, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        # For yield statements
        return max_allowed, 0

    return max_allowed, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted has been simplified. The conditions for different line types like decorators, definitions, class declarations, flow control, imports, and yield statements have been appropriately handled to ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted before the current line.

Please test the corrected function with the failing test case to confirm that it now passes successfully.
