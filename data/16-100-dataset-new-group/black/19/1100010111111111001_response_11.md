## Solution

### Analysis
The `maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be mistakenly categorizing different cases. The function should determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line and the number of trailing spaces to add. Based on the failing test and the provided runtime/expected values, it seems that there's an issue with the way the function should handle the calculation and insertion of empty lines.

### Bug Identification
The issue seems to reside in the calculation of `newlines`, which should define how many empty lines to include based on specific conditions. Additionally, the computation of `before` can be less error-prone.

### Bug Explanation
Based on the failing test and the calculated output, the `maybe_empty_lines` function is not consistently identifying when and how many empty lines to include in the output. This is causing the assertion error with the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The function needs to be refactored to include appropriate handling of the conditions defined in the failing test cases. By correctly identifying when to insert and how many empty lines to include, the function should ensure the correctness of the calculation and return the expected values.

### Corrected Code
The corrected version of the `maybe_empty_lines` function is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed) if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
   
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This correction ensures proper handling of different conditions and calculation of empty lines and trailing spaces based on the specific requirements of the failing test cases as identified through the provided input/output and expected values.
