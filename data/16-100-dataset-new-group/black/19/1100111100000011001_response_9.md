The bug is that the variable `newlines` is being incorrectly returned as a tuple with two values: `newlines` and `0` instead of just `newlines` as the first value. This is causing a conflict with the expected return type of the function, which is `Tuple[int, int]`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the return statement to ensure that only a single integer value is returned in all cases. We should also make sure that the return statement returns the expected values and types of the variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> int:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1

    return before
```

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all the provided test cases.
