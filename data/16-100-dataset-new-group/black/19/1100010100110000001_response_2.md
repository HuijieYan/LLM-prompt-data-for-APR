## Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not properly handling the empty lines when it comes to Decorators and Import statements. This is causing a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs when the function is called.

## Bug Explanation
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of empty lines before decorators and import statements. The function is not detecting the appropriate number of newlines to insert based on these conditions, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

## Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for inserting empty lines before decorators and import statements to ensure the correct number of newlines is inserted.
2. Verify that the conditionals are correctly detecting decorators and import statements.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 
After correcting the function, it should properly handle empty lines before decorators and import statements, which should fix the mismatch between expected and actual outputs.
