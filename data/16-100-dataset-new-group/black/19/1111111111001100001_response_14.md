The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not working as intended and is causing the test `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail. The function is responsible for returning the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function's decision-making logic, in relation to various attributes of the Line class and stateful attributes of the EmptyLineTracker class, appears to be leading to incorrect computations.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it is observed that the values of `self.previous_defs` and `max_allowed` are not being properly updated, leading to incorrect calculations.

The following issues have been identified:
- In Case 7, when updating the `self.previous_defs` list, the depth is being incorrectly updated to 0 instead of the current line's depth value.
- The handling of `max_allowed` is not consistent with the logic in the conditional statements.

To resolve the issues, the following strategy can be utilized:
1. Ensure that the `self.previous_defs` list is updated correctly with the current line's depth.
2. Revisit the logic used for updating the `max_allowed` variable and adjust it based on different conditional branches.

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if not current_line.leaves:
        before = 0
    else:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the identified issues and resolve the failing test by producing the expected output.
