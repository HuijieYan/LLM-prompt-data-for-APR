After analyzing the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the calculation of the variable `newlines` in a scenario related to decorators. The expected behavior of the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is to correctly calculate the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on its context and the previous line.

Based on the analysis of the cases presented, the variable `newlines` is calculated based on the depth of the current line, where `newlines = 2` if the depth is non-zero, otherwise it should be equal to `1`. However, the previous line's context and type are being ignored, leading to incorrect calculations involving decorators.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of context-based line insertions. Specifically, the function does not take into account the type of the previous line (decorator, import, yield, flow control) or the presence of the original previous line. This results in improper line insertions and erroneous `newlines` calculation when decorators, imports, or yields are involved.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by considering the type and context of the previous line when calculating the number of empty lines to insert. Existing conditions based on the depth for context handling can be replaced or supplemented with cases to consider the type of the previous line. The goal should be to correctly determine the number of newlines to add before the current line based on the type and context of the previous line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the identified issue and the expected functionality, the following corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Existing logic for max_allowed calculation
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    # Logic for handling decorators, imports, and yields
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        if depth:
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    # Default case
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function includes additional conditions to handle decorators, imports, yields, and other line types correctly when determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. These changes address the issues identified in the failing test cases and should provide the expected behavior for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
