Based on the analysis of the buggy function and its runtime input/output variables, the error message from the failing test, it appears that the bug is related to the conditional statements and the updating of the `before` variable. The issue seems to be related to the logic within the conditionals and how they affect `before`. Additionally, the use of `self.previous_defs.append(depth)` seems to have a conflicting impact.

To fix this bug, we can update the conditional logic and the handling of the `before` variable to correctly calculate the empty lines before and after the line. Additionally, the `self.previous_defs` list update logic should be revised.

Below, I've provided a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield:
        if depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues with the conditional logic and the `before` variable update. It also revises the handling of `self.previous_defs` list for better tracking the depth of previous definitions. With these changes, the function should pass the failing test without any assertion errors.
