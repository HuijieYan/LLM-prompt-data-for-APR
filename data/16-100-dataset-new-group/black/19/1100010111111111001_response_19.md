The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be fixed. The function is not fulfilling the expected input/output values, which is leading to a failing test.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect logic within the function where it calculates `newlines`. The `newlines` count should account for whether the code depth is non-zero. Additionally, the `before` condition is leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to adjust the conditions and logic for calculating `newlines` and `before` based on the depth and types of the statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            if current_line.depth == 0:
                newlines = 0
            else:
                newlines = 1
            return newlines, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected function takes into account the depth and type of the statement to accurately calculate `newlines`, `before`, and set the `max_allowed` based on the depth condition.
