The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it is not properly handling the logic for calculating the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. There are multiple conditions and checks in the function that may not be working as expected, leading to incorrect calculations.

One strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review each conditional statement and associated logic to ensure they are correctly handling the cases for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 1
    if self.previous_line is None:
        return before, after

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            before = 0
        else:
            before = 1
        return before, after

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line.is_def or self.previous_line.is_class:
            before = 1
        return before, after

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        after = 1
        return before, after

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        before = 1
        return before, after

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        before = 1
        return before, after

    return before, after
```

In the corrected version, each condition is properly handled to calculate the `before` and `after` values based on the specific requirements.

This corrected version should address the buggy behavior in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and pass the failing test.
