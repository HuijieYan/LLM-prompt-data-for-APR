The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the `before` variable that is being assigned incorrectly as `1` or `2` in some code paths. Additionally, the `self.previous_defs` list is not being used consistently.

The correct strategy for fixing the bug involves:
1. Ensuring that the `before` variable is set appropriately for each code path.
2. Properly using `self.previous_defs` to maintain the depth of previous definitions. 
3. Returning the correct values based on the logic implemented in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines if it exists
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    # Pop previous definitions based on depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    # Check for decorators, defs, and classes
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        # Maintain previous defs list
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    # Check for flow control lines
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Check for imports and yields
    if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_import or self.previous_line.is_yield):
        if (not (current_line.is_import or current_line.is_yield)) and (depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the function consistently updates the `before` value based on the condition for each block of logic. It also uses `self.previous_defs` appropriately when maintaining the previous definition depths. With this fix, the function should behave correctly and pass the failing test.
