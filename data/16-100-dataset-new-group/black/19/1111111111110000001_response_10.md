The error in this buggy function is likely due to incorrect logic for handling empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The failing test "test_comment_in_decorator" indicates that the current implementation of `_maybe_empty_lines` is not producing the expected output.

The cause of the bug, as indicated by the failing test, is that the function is not correctly handling the expected number of empty lines before and after the processed line. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual output, leading to an AssertionError.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to review and correct the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure it correctly computes the number of empty lines before and after the processed line based on the given conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the usage of `is_import` and `is_yield` functions is updated to include parentheses to call these functions (e.g., `self.previous_line.is_import()` and `current_line.is_yield()`).

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
