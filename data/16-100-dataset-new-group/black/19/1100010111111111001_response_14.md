The cause of the bug is the incorrect assignment of the `max_allowed` variable within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. In particular, the `max_allowed` variable is being set to 2 if the `current_line`'s depth is 0, but it is incorrectly being set to 1 if the `depth` is non-zero, leading to inconsistent behavior. 

To fix this bug, the `max_allowed` assignment should only depend on the `depth` of `current_line`, not just when it is 0. Additionally, it appears that initializing `before` within the function may also cause inconsistencies due to its reassignment, which should be handled carefully to maintain consistency.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
       not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
       (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0

```

The corrected function avoids inconsistent behavior by setting `max_allowed` based on the `depth` of `current_line`, and properly handles the `before` variable to ensure consistent return values. This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the failing tests now pass.
