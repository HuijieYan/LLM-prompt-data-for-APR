The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing an assertion error in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test.

The bug appears to be related to the handling of empty lines and the calculation of `before` and `depth` for different line conditions. It seems that the logic used to determine when to insert empty lines is flawed.

The core issue seems to be with the calculation of `before` within the function, which depends on various conditions such as the depth of the current line, the nature of the previous line, and whether the current line is a decorator, import, or flow control statement.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially rewritten to ensure that the calculation of the `before` and `depth` variables is correct for each condition.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 0  # Modified this line

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import()
            and not current_line.is_import()
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return max(before, 1), 0  # Modified this line

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield()
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return max(before, 1), 0  # Modified this line

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, there are modifications in the conditions involving the `before` variable to ensure that it accounts for all relevant scenarios. Additionally, the checks for `is_import` and `is_yield` call the corresponding functions to correctly identify these conditions.

It should be noted that the complete correction is not possible without understanding the entire `Leaf` and `Line` class definitions and other utility functions. Therefore, this solution focuses on fixing the issues related to the initial logic identified in the function. Additional updates may be necessary based on further context.
