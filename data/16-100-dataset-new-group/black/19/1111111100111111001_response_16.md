To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address several issues in the code:

1. The `return` statements within the function are not consistent in terms of the values returned. Some `return` statements return a tuple containing two values, while others return two separate values. We need to ensure consistency.

2. There are uninitialized variables in the function, such as `newlines`, which needs to be defined before it is used.

3. The conditional logic for inserting empty lines seems to be incorrect as per the failing test results. We need to carefully revise the logic and conditions for inserting empty lines based on the context of the current and previous lines.

Given these issues and the expected input/output values in the failing test, here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line:
        newlines = 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return newlines, newlines
        elif self.previous_line.is_yield:
            newlines += 1
            if current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
                return before, newlines
        elif self.previous_line.is_import:
            if not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                return before or 1, newlines
        elif self.previous_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        return newlines, 0
    else:
        return 0, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for checking the context of the previous line has been refactored to determine the appropriate number of empty lines before and after the current line. This should resolve the issues observed in the failing tests.
