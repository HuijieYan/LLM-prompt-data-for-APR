### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is expected to return a tuple of two integers. The function is supposed to handle multiple conditions based on the attributes of the input `current_line`. However, in some test cases, it fails to determine the appropriate behavior based on the input.

Errors in the function could be due to incorrect conditional checks, missed calculations, or improper assignments. The buggy function encountered an assertion error due to improper handling of empty lines between certain lines of code.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The code handling the assignment of `newlines` in the `if` condition checks for `is_decorator` or `is_def` conditions, and the condition block afterward needs to be revisited. Additionally, the code handling `previous_defs` might not be functioning as expected in all cases and needs to be reviewed.

A potential fix could involve revisiting the conditions and how the variables are being manipulated within each condition block to address the incorrect behavior of the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```
The corrected version of the function should address the issues encountered in the failing test cases.
