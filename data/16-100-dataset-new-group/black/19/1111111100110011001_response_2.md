The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is attempting to determine the number of potential empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, the function contains some logical errors that lead to the failing test and assertion error.

The primary bugs in the function can be attributed to the incorrect handling of conditional cases, particularly in the computation of the `before` value and the checks for different line types. The `max_allowed` value is also not being set correctly. Furthermore, it seems that the state of variables like `is_decorator` and `depth` are not properly handled in the conditional checks within the function.

Since the function is relatively complex, the strategy for fixing this bug involves carefully revisiting the conditional logic within the function and ensuring that the state of the variables is appropriately handled.

Below is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)

            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)

            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

        elif current_line.is_def:
            self.previous_defs = self.previous_defs[:-1]

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This fixed version of the function should address the logical errors observed in the original implementation and is expected to pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output values.
