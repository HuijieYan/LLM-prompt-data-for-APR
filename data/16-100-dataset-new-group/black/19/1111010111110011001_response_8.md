To fix the buggy function, it is necessary to update `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class so that it correctly handles the computation of the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The potential errors within the function include:
1. Incorrect computation of `max_allowed`.
2. Modification of the `previous_defs` list during iteration.
3. Inconsistent handling of different types of lines, such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

Based on the failing test, the bug causes incorrect handling of empty lines, leading to differences between the expected and actual output. The primary cause is the inconsistent logic implemented in `_maybe_empty_lines`.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to revise the algorithm used for calculating empty lines based on different types of lines and nesting depth. Refactoring the logic to efficiently handle these scenarios would lead to a more accurate and consistent computation.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator):
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
    return newlines, 0 if current_line.is_flow_control else 1
```

In the corrected version, the computation of `max_allowed` is corrected based on the nesting depth. The algorithm to handle different types of lines and nesting conditions has been refactored to ensure accurate calculation of empty lines.
