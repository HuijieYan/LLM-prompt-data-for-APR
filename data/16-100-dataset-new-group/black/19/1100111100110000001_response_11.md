Looking at the error message, it seems that the formatting of the output is not as expected. This might indicate that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which is responsible for adding newlines, is not functioning correctly.

After analyzing the function, it seems that the issue might be related to the logic for inserting empty lines. Additionally, there are multiple conditions based on the properties of the `current_line` and `previous_line`.

The cause of the bug might be related to incorrect handling of scenarios where newlines need to be inserted based on the properties of the lines. It's also possible that the logic for inserting empty lines is not appropriately checking for all conditions, leading to unexpected output.

To fix the bug, we can review the logic for inserting empty lines and ensure that it covers all necessary cases based on line properties and depth.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # Logic for consuming the first leaf's extra newlines
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Logic for popping previous definitions and updating before
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, we have revised the logic for inserting empty lines based on the conditions provided. We also corrected the calls to `is_import` and `is_yield` functions by adding parentheses to indicate that they are being called as functions. This should address the issues and ensure that the function behaves as expected, passing the failing test.
