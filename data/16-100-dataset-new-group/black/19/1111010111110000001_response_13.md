The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It seems that the function is not properly handling the newlines and empty lines in the input string, causing the test case `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, and it is not properly handling the decorators, imports, yields, and flow control statements.

To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be refactored to correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed and handle decorators, imports, yields, and flow control statements.

I suggested strategy for fixing the bug is:
1. Properly calculate the number of empty lines needed based on the conditions specified in the function.
2. Handle decorators, imports, yields, and flow control statements according to their specific requirements for empty lines.
3. Ensure that the function takes into account the prefix and the depth of the current line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

With this corrected version, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test.
