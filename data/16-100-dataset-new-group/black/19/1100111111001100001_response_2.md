The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic is not considering the cases for adding empty lines properly. 

The issue arises from the fact that when the `is_decorator` attribute of `current_line` is True, it doesn't properly handle the cases of adding empty lines. The code also does not consider all the necessary conditions for adding empty lines before the return.

To fix this, we need to add a check for `is_decorator` when deciding the count of newlines to be added. Additionally, we should consider all the necessary conditions for adding empty lines based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adding the necessary condition checks and adjusting the logic for adding empty lines, the function should now pass the failing test.
