The issue with the buggy function could be due to incorrect handling of the `max_allowed` variable and the logic around determining the newlines to be returned.

The bug appears to be in the logic used to compute the `before` variable that represents the number of potential extra empty lines needed before the currently processed line. The issue with the `before` variable could be causing incorrect handling of the newlines in the returned result.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the incorrect computation and handling of the `before` variable, which is resulting in incorrect numbers of newlines before and after the currently processed line.

A potential strategy to fix the bug would be to review the logic around the computation of the `before` variable and ensure that it accurately represents the number of potential extra empty lines needed before the currently processed line. Additionally, the logic around determining the newlines to be returned should be reviewed to ensure correctness.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues with the original implementation and pass the failing test cases.
