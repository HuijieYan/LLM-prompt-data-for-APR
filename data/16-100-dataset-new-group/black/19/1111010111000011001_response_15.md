The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. There are a few key issues with the logic that need to be resolved:

1. The `before` variable is not correctly updated to 1 if the depth is 0 and there are no leaves.
2. The check for `current_line.is_decorator` is misplaced and does not handle the scenario correctly.
3. The handling of different cases based on different conditions is not properly structured or handled.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines needs to be refactored to handle each scenario correctly and consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2  # Update max_allowed based on current_line.depth
    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With the corrected logic, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
