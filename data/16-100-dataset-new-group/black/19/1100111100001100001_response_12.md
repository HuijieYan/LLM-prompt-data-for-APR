Based on the analysis of the runtime input/output values and types, it is evident that the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by incorrect logic for determining the number of newlines. Specifically, the conditions and logic for setting `newlines` and returning newlines are not consistent, leading to incorrect behavior.

To address the bug, we should ensure that the conditions for determining the number of newlines are properly handled, including handling the edge cases and logic. In particular, the calculations relating to `newlines`, `before`, and the return values should be carefully revised and corrected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to address the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I've adjusted the logic related to `before`, `newlines`, and returned values to ensure consistent and proper handling of the conditions and edge cases. This should resolve the bug and ensure correct behavior of the function.
