The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be incorrectly handling the insertion of empty lines before and after certain types of lines in a file.

The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is testing the formatting of comments within decorators. The error message indicates that the expected and actual formatted output do not match, and this is flagged as an `AssertionError`. The expected and actual outputs contain differences in the number of empty lines in the comments within decorator blocks.

The potential error locations in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function are the conditional branches that determine the number of newlines to insert before and after certain types of lines. There might be issues with these conditional branches that result in incorrect decisions about how many lines to insert.

To fix the bug, it is important to carefully review and correct the conditional branches that determine the number of newlines to insert before and after certain types of lines.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version, the conditional branches are modified to provide the correct calculation of empty lines before and after different types of lines in the code.

After applying this correction, the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` should pass without triggering an `AssertionError`.
