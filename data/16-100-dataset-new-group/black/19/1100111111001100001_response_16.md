Upon analyzing the buggy function, some potential error locations can be detected. The primary cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of whitespace and newlines based on the current line's properties. The code makes decisions about how many newlines to include based on the type of the current line, but due to conditional logic, it can end up including more or fewer newlines than necessary.

The `before` variable is being incorrectly assigned a value within the while loop. The variable `before` is set to 1 if `depth` is `True`, and else 2. This conditional setting can potentially produce unintended behavior. Additionally, the decision making logic for newlines is complicating the flow of the code and might lead to incorrect cases.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to simplify the logic for newlines and enforce a consistent approach based on the type of the current line. The conditional logic and while loop should be streamlined to provide a more straightforward and reliable approach.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 1, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 0, 0
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 0, 0
    else:
        return 0, 0
```

This corrected version should now handle empty lines consistently based on the type of the current line, avoiding potential issues related to incorrect assignment of newlines.
