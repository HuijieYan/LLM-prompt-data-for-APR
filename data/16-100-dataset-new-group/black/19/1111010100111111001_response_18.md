The provided codes suggest a bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which belongs to the `EmptyLineTracker` class in the `black.py` file. Based on the error message and the runtime input/output values, it seems that there is an issue with handling empty lines before and after specific lines.

The problematic logic appears to be in the `while` loop where previous definitions are being popped. This is expected to be 1 when the depth is `0` and 2 for others, but this logic seems incorrect based on failed test case outputs.

To fix this bug, the conditions inside the while loops need to be adjusted and the logic for handling `before` variable needs to be modified to accurately determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

Additionally, based on the inputs and expected outputs provided for the failed case, the correct implementation of `_maybe_empty_lines` returns a tuple `(newlines, 0)` if neither of the if, elif, or last 'if' statements are satisfied by the current_line properties. This tuple represents the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    
    if (
        current_line.is_decorator
        or current_line.is_def
        or current_line.is_class
    ):
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```
This proposed correction of the function is based on an analysis of the existing code, the inputs, and expected outputs given for the failing test. It should allow for the correct number of empty lines to be counted before and after the current line for a wide range of input cases. However, as the function is quite complex and the provided examples are limited, this correction may require further testing to ensure its accuracy in all scenarios.


Therefore the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function attempts to address the identified bugs and return the expected results for the failed test cases. Efforts have been made to improve readability and maintain good coding practices. However, if the issue persists, further adjustments may be necessary.
