The problem with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it is returning incorrect values in certain cases. After analyzing the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the function returns unexpected numbers of newlines and should also maintain or update some state variables. 

Based on the provided analyses, it seems that the bug could be in particular returning a value of `2` when newlines should be subtracted in some cases, as well as improperly handling the `self.previous_defs` list.

To fix the bug, the function should handle these cases properly and adjust the control flows to return the correct number of newlines and update the state variables appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the code:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before - 1 if before > 0 else 0), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return (before - 1 if before > 0 else 0), 0  # Updated to handle default case
```
In the corrected version, I've updated the code using the analysis insights. The relevant updates include properly handling newlines in each control flow condition, as well as adjusting the value of `before` based on the business logic.

The corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
