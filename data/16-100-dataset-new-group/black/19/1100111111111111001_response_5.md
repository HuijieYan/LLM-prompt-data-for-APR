The root cause of the bug is the improper adjustment of `max_allowed` for empty lines. The function does not correctly consider adjustments to max_allowed based on the logical conditions.

To fix the bug, you need to revise how empty lines with depth and other attributes are handled. Additionally, there are some inconsistencies with self.previous_defs. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if (self.previous_line and 
            not self.previous_line.is_decorator and 
            self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth):
            return 1, 0
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line and 
        self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and 
        self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (self.previous_line and 
        self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or self.previous_line.depth != current_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

The modifications made here adjust the handling of `max_allowed` and the conditions for empty lines based on attributes and the depth of the current line.

These changes should ensure the function works correctly and helps pass the failing tests.
