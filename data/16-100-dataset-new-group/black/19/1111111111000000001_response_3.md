The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it is not properly handling the cases for different types of current lines, such as decorators, import statements, flow control, and yields. This is causing the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling different types of current lines and their interactions with the previous line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
        
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
        
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import()
            and not current_line.is_import()
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield()
            and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have added function calls for `current_line.is_import()` and `current_line.is_yield()` to correctly determine the type of the current line. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
