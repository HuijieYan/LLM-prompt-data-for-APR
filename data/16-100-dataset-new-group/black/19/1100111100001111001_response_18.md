The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is used to determine the number of extra newlines to be inserted before the current line of code. Based on the provided expected and runtime values, the bug seems to lie in the last part of the function where the return values are being computed. In particular, the conditions and calculations around `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`, and the subsequent `if` conditions seem to be handling the conditionals and return computations incorrectly.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves analyzing and re-implementing the conditional checks and return logic for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function while considering the correct conditions to check and the intended behavior for extra newlines.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditional checks and return logic have been re-implemented to account for various conditions such as decorators, definitions, classes, flow control, imports, and yields, while also handling the depth of the current line and previous line appropriately.
