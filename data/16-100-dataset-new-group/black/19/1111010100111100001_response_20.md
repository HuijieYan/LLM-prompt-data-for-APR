The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from incorrect logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

1. The function assumes that there may be extra newlines before and after the current line, but the implementation does not always produce the correct number of empty lines.

2. The `max_allowed` variable is set based on the `depth` of the `current_line` and is not always updated correctly.

3. In some cases, the function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines needed for decorators, flow control, imports, and yield statements.

To fix the bug:
- Ensure that the `max_allowed` variable is correctly updated based on the conditions.
- Adjust the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed for decorators, flow control, imports, and yield statements.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues with the original implementation and ensure that the function properly calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
