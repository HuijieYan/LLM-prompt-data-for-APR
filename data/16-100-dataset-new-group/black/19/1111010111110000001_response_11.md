The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is intended to provide a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` in `test_black.py` checks for incorrect formatting.

The potential error locations in the buggy function could be related to the logic for calculating the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The error message from the failing test indicates that the formatting of the source code is not matching the expected output, which suggests that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines.

One potential cause of the bug could be an incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output. This could be due to incorrect condition checks and handling of different scenarios within the function.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve carefully reviewing the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, ensuring that the conditions for inserting empty lines are accurately evaluated and the number of empty lines is calculated correctly based on the requirements defined in the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling different scenarios and calculating the number of empty lines has been reviewed and adjusted to ensure accurate behavior. This corrected version should pass the failing test and correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
