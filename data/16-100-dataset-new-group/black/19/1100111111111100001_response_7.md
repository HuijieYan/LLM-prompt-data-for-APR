The bug in the given function is causing a failure in the `assertFormatEqual` test. The provided function `_maybe_empty_lines` should determine the number of empty lines to be added before the current line based on different conditions. However, the logic inside the function seems to be incorrect, leading to an incorrect number of empty lines being returned, causing the failing tests.

The potential error locations in the buggy function could be in the conditional statements that are supposed to determine the number of empty lines to be added. 

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements inside the function are not being evaluated correctly, leading to incorrect return values for the number of empty lines.

To fix the bug, we need to re-evaluate the conditional statements inside the function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is being returned based on the input conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statements in the function are re-evaluated to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is being returned based on the input conditions. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
