The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the `newlines` value is not calculated correctly. In multiple cases, the function is returning a hard-coded value of `2` for `newlines` instead of calculating it dynamically based on the condition. The hard-coded value often results in incorrect empty lines being added. 

To fix the bug, the `newlines` value should be recalculated for each condition by considering the current line's depth. For instance, whenever `newlines` is being assigned a value of `2`, it can be modified to `newlines - min(current_line.depth, 1)` to make the number of empty lines dynamic.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: black.py

# this is the corrected function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - min(current_line.depth, 1)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this corrected code, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should work as intended and pass the failing test cases.
