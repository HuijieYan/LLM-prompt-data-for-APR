Based on the error message and the expected input/output values, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how it's processing the current line and previous line, as well as the conditions under which empty lines are inserted. The function should also interact with the `Leaf` and `EmptyLineTracker` classes.

The buggy function is over-complicated and contains many potential error locations based on the different if and while conditions. The cause of the bug is likely due to inconsistent or incorrect logic in handling newlines, prefixes, and the previous lines.

Therefore, the strategy for fixing the bug is to simplify the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, short-circuiting for specific cases, and ensuring that the depth, leaves, prefix, and other relevant properties are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        return 2, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    return 0, 0
```

The corrected version simplifies the logic by removing unnecessary checks and focusing on specific conditions related to decorators, imports, yield statements, and flow control statements. This should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
