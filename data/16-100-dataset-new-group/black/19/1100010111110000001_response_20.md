The bug appears to be related to the function `_maybe_empty_lines` and is causing failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` in the file `tests/test_black.py`. The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output.

The cause of the bug could be in the logic of `_maybe_empty_lines`, which is responsible for handling empty lines and preserving the formatting of the code. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the insertion of empty lines in decorators, flow control, and import statements.

To fix the bug, the logic for inserting empty lines in decorators, flow control, and import statements needs to be revised.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling decorators, flow control, and import statements has been modified to ensure the insertion of empty lines is handled correctly. This should resolve the failing test scenario.
