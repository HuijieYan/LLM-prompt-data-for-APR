Based on the error message and the given runtime values, it seems that the issue is due to the incorrect identification of decorators. The current implementation of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function incorrectly handles decorators and determines the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. This results in unexpected output, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, the logic that checks for decorators needs to be reevaluated and adjusted if necessary. Specifically, the conditions to identify decorators and manage related behaviors should be reviewed. Additionally, the logic for handling the insertion of empty lines before and after each line should be carefully analyzed and corrected as needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator or any(leaf.kind == 'AT' for leaf in current_line.leaves)
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the condition of identifying decorators has been modified to better handle cases where decorators are represented by the '@' symbol, which may not be explicitly recognized as decorators in the original implementation. The adjusted logic should now provide the expected output and pass the failing tests.
