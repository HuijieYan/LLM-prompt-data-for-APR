The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely in the logic that decides how many empty lines to add before the current line. It seems that the current code is not handling all the cases correctly based on the provided input/output values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly handle different conditions based on the input parameters and expected output. Specifically, we should ensure that the `before` and `newlines` values are calculated accurately based on the conditions in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] > depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This fix addresses the incorrect handling of newlines before the first leaf and corrects the behavior of the `newlines` and `before` variables to better match the expected conditions and outcomes.
During the fix, the # TODO comments in the input and output values were altered.
