The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is defined within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It takes a `current_line` as input and returns a tuple of two integers representing the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

There are a few potential error locations in the function that could lead to bugs:

1. Incorrect logic for updating `before` variable based on conditions.

2. Improper handling of the `depth` and `previous_defs` attributes.

3. Inconsistent return values based on different conditions.

4. Improper handling of previous and current lines of code.

The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is the incorrect computation and handling of the number of empty lines before and after the current line. This is due to the mismanagement of the `before` variable and improper handling of conditions related to the previous and current lines of code.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be refactored to properly handle the conditions and compute the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
