The error lies in the logic of the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`. When checking for certain conditions and deciding the number of empty lines to return, it is possible that the conditions specified are not being evaluated correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function must be reviewed and corrected to accurately calculate and return the expected number of empty lines. Ensuring proper evaluation and comparison of conditions, as well as handling edge cases, would be essential to address the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(1, self.previous_after), 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (self.previous_after or 1), 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return self.previous_after, 1

    return self.previous_after, 0
```

The corrected version of `_maybe_empty_lines` function should address the issue and produce the expected output according to the provided test cases.
