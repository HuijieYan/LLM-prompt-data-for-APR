The potential error in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be returned based on the conditions. The function has multiple conditions and return statements, and it seems that the logic may be flawed, leading to incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines to be returned.

Based on the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`, it seems that the issue might be related to handling comments within decorators. The failing test could be failing due to incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines when comments are present within decorators. 

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to review the logic within the function and simplify it, ensuring that it correctly handles the cases where comments are present within decorators.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the handling of decorators and depth has been simplified to ensure that comments within decorators are properly handled. The logic for handling import and yield statements has also been adjusted to account for the correct depth comparison.
