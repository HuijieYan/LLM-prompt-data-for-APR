The `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to contain a bug as it returns multiple values in certain conditions, which is not allowed by the specified return type of `Tuple[int, int]`. Specifically, the function returns `(newlines, 0)` in a condition where it is expected to only return a single value. This leads to a return type mismatch error.

Additionally, in cases where `self.previous_line` is None, the function returns two values, while it should only be returning a single value of 0. This is inconsistent with the expected return type of `Tuple[int, int]`.

To resolve this issue, I will recommend modifying the logic of the function to ensure that it only returns a single integer in these cases, consistent with both the specified return type and the expected logic of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return (0, 0)
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return (newlines, 0)
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return (before, 1)
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```
With these changes, the function should now satisfy both the expected input/output values and the specified return type.
