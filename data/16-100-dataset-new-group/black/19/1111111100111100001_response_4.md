The bug appears to be with the logic associated with the conditions inside the while loop and the subsequent conditional block. The `while` loop appears to have a logical flaw due to the condition `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth` as it allows 'before' to be reset regardless of its current value.

A suggested strategy for fixing this bug would be to remove the `while` loop and directly apply the logic inside the loop to the subsequent conditional block. Also, it seems `before` is getting overwritten in multiple places, so we need to ensure that its value is retained for the subsequent condition checks.

Here is the updated and fixed version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0  # default value
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before or 1, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before or 1, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
