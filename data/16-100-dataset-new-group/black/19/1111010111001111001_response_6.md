## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be in how the `before` and `newlines` variables are being manipulated based on the different branches that affect their values. To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic for updates to these variables to ensure that they are being assigned and updated correctly based on the specified conditions.

## Code implementation of the corrected function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if (not is_decorator) and (self.previous_line is not None):
            return 0, 0
    
        if (self.previous_line is not None) and (self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line is not None) and (self.previous_line.is_import) and (not current_line.is_import) and (depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (self.previous_line is not None) and (self.previous_line.is_yield) and (not current_line.is_yield or (depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

With the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected input/output values.
