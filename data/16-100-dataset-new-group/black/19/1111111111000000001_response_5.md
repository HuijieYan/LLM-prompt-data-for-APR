The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function from the `EmptyLineTracker` class is that it fails to correctly calculate the number of newlines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions.

Potential error locations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Incorrect calculation of `before` and `newlines` variables.
2. Inconsistent handling of conditions for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

Cause of the bug:
The bug exists because the function incorrectly calculates the number of newlines needed based on different conditions, leading to incorrect formatting of the code.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review and correct the logic for calculating the `before` and `newlines` variables based on the conditions defined in the function.
2. Ensure consistent handling of conditions for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.
3. Test the corrected function to ensure it passes the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0] if current_line.leaves else None
        before = 0 if first_leaf is None else min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        if first_leaf:
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for calculating `before` and `newlines` has been revised to ensure accurate computation based on the conditions specified. Additionally, the handling of conditions for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields has been made consistent.

With these changes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test.
