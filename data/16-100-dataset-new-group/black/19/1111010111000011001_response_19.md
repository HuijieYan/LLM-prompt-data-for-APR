To fix the buggy function, we'll identify potential error locations based on the failing test case. In the failing test case, we see that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` encounters multiple checks and manipulations related to the `current_line` and other parameters. The expected values and types reveal how certain conditions and values should be handled in different cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't consistently return the expected number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. It seems to have issues related to handling newlines, empty lines, decorators, imports, and flow control. The handling of these conditions is not aligning with the expected values provided in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we can consider refactoring the logic and making sure it aligns with the expected cases. We'll need to ensure that the conditions and comparisons are correctly evaluating the state of the `current_line` and other relevant attributes, and the return values are consistent with the expected output in each case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if "\n" in first_leaf.prefix else 0
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0

``` 

In this corrected version, we have restructured the conditional statements and return logic to align with the expected values in the failing test cases. Additionally, we have adjusted the handling of newlines, decorators, and other conditions to ensure the correct number of empty lines is returned before and after the currently processed line.
