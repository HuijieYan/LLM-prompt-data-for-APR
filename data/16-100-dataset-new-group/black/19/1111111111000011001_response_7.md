The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is most likely due to the incorrect use of conditions and assignments within the function, resulting in unexpected values being assigned to variables. 

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Identify the conditional branches that are not being handled correctly.
2. Validate the conditions and ensure that the correct values are assigned to the variables before the function's return.
3. Make sure that all the cases identified in the failing test are handled properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function based on the explanation above:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: list
    prefix: str
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

@dataclass
class Leaf:
    type: str
    value: str

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: list

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

With this corrected function, all the expected values and types of variables right before the function's return in the failing test cases should match the expected values specified.
