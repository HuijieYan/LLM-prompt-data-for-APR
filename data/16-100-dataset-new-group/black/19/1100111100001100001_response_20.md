The cause of the bug is that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the scenarios with decorators, class, def, flow control, imports, or yields. The function is also incorrect when determining the number of newlines to return based on the previous line.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the function to properly handle these scenarios and determine the correct number of newlines to return based on the logic applied.

Given the buggy function, here's the corrected version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.is_import:
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function properly handles scenarios related to decorators, classes, defs, flow control, imports, and yields. Additionally, it ensures that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the logic applied.
