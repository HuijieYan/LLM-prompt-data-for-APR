The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to occur due to the incorrect handling of conditions and values related to empty lines, decorators, and previous line types. The return values for empty lines, flow control, imports, and yield are not correctly computed, leading to an inconsistency between expected and actual values.

Based on the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue is related to the incorrect assignment and comparison of variables `before` and `max_allowed` within the function.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be adopted:
1. Properly handle the cases for empty lines, decorators, flow control, imports, and yield within the function.
2. Ensure that the correct values for newlines, depth, and before are returned based on the conditions that are being evaluated.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth > 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the necessary adjustments and handling the conditions appropriately, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
