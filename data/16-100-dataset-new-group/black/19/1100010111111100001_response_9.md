The buggy function takes in a `current_line` and returns a Tuple of two integers, `before` and `depth`. The function primarily handles indentation, empty lines, and comments.

Potential Error Locations:
1. The `max_allowed` variable is incorrectly set to 1 before immediately being set to 2 when `current_line.depth` is 0. The inconsistency in this logic may cause unexpected behavior.
2. The block of code involving the condition `if current_line.is_flow_control` has a condition that directly returns `before` and 1 without considering other scenarios.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug appears to be related to the incorrect setting of the `max_allowed` variable and the direct returns of `before` without considering other scenarios, leading to inconsistencies in the empty line handling.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for setting the `max_allowed` variable to ensure it is correctly assigned based on the value of `current_line.depth`.
2. Modify the condition that handles `current_line.is_flow_control` to encompass all relevant scenarios and return the appropriate values based on the input.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth != 0:
            before = 1
        else:
            before = max_allowed

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1 if max_allowed > 1 else 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 0 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```
By correcting the assignment of `max_allowed` based on the value of `current_line.depth` and updating the conditions to handle various scenarios, the corrected function is expected to fix the bug and pass the failing test.
