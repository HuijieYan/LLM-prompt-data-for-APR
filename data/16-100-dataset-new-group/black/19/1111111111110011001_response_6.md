The bug here is that the "current_line" object and its attributes are not being correctly evaluated given the conditions stated in the function. This causes incorrect values for "before" and "newlines" variables that impact the final return values.

The cause of the bug is a misinterpretation of the "current_line" object's attributes, which leads to incorrect decisions within the function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the "current_line" object is accurately evaluated and its attributes are correctly analyzed to make the appropriate decisions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = len(first_leaf.prefix.split("\n"))
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = is_decorator(current_line)
    is_def = is_def(current_line)
    is_class = is_class(current_line)
    is_flow_control = is_flow_control(current_line)
    is_import = is_import(current_line)
    is_yield = is_yield(current_line)
    if is_decorator or is_def or is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not is_import:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and is_yield(self.previous_line) and (not is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the attributes of the "current_line" object are evaluated using appropriate functions (like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, etc.) to determine the state of the line correctly. Additionally, the `before` variable is calculated based on the count of newlines in the prefix of the first leaf. This corrected implementation should fix the bug.
