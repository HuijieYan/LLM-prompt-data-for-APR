The bug in the provided function is causing failing tests and is associated with the class `EmptyLineTracker`. The `_maybe_empty_lines` method inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for returning the number of potential empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The potential errors in this function are:
1. Handling of `self.previous_defs` to determine the number of empty lines before the current line.
2. Calculating the `newlines` variable in the case when the current line is a decorator or a def/class.

Explanation of the cause of the bug for each case:
1. In the failing test, the value of `self.previous_defs` may not be handled correctly. It seems that the value of `before` is always calculated as 0, which might not be the expected behavior.

2. The computation of the `newlines` variable with conditional branching might not be handling the cases correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to:
1. Revisit the logic for handling `self.previous_defs` and ensure that it is handled correctly to calculate the number of empty lines before the current line.
2. Revise the logic for calculating the `newlines` variable based on the conditions provided in the function and the requirements from the failing test cases.

Below is the updated version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` method considering the analysis:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The updated function should now handle the `previous_defs` and calculate the `newlines` variable correctly based on the provided conditions.
