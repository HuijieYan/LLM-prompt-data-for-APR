The issue with the buggy function is that it's not correctly handling the logic to calculate the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line.

The first bug is in the logic for reseting `before` value where the smallest of the two values is being picked but it should be reset to `max_allowed` if it's greater than `max_allowed`. The logic should be changed from 
```python
before = min(before, max_allowed)
```
to
```python
before = min(before, max_allowed) if before <= max_allowed else max_allowed
```

Another issue is that the function needs to use `self` parameter's methods to access functions instead of the global functions defined in the same file, so the `is_import` function should be called as `self.is_import` within the function to resolve potential issues.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed) if before <= max_allowed else max_allowed
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def() or current_line.is_class():
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control():
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
