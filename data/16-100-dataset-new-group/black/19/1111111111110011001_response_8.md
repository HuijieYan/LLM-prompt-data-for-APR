The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` contains several issues that lead to the failing test:

1. The initial value of `max_allowed` isn't set to the correct value, causing issues in the conditional logic that follows.
2. If the condition `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:` is met, the logic inside the block doesn't correspond to the given test case.

To fix these issues, we should assign the correct initial value to `max_allowed` and update the condition blocks and logic accordingly.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    # Fix the conditional statement below to match the expected values
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    # Add an else-if block to fix the conditional statement
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        ):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    # The rest of the original logic remains unchanged
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

With these updates, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
