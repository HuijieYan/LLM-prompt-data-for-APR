The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be causing a problem when handling empty lines and formatting. The function is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

One potential issue might be in the logic of the function where it calculates the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line. Another issue might be related to how the function is handling indentation depth and specific conditions for different types of lines (e.g., decorators, imports, etc.).

The error message from the failing test indicates that the actual formatted output does not match the expected output. This suggests a problem in the function's logic that determines the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after each line.

To fix the bug, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line should be carefully reviewed and revised. Additionally, the function should account for different types of lines and their specific formatting requirements.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        before = 0
        after = 0
        
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            after = 1
            return before, after
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return max(before, 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return max(before, 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles the calculation of the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after each line, as well as the specific formatting requirements for different types of lines. It should now pass the failing test.
