The bug appears to be caused by a incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line based on its attributes. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is expected to return a tuple containing the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

An analysis of the input/output values and expected input/output values shows that the variables `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` are not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect return values in the function.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
1. Update the logic to calculate the correct number of empty lines based on different conditions and attributes of the current and previous lines.
2. Ensure that the correct values of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` are determined for different scenarios.

Based on the expected input/output values, a corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines` could be as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    # Adjust number of empty lines based on conditions
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        return 2 if depth else 1, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions are updated based on the expected input/output values to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned for different scenarios. This should address the issue and make the function return the expected values for various cases.
