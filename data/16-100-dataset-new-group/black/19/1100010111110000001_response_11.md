The provided buggy function is part of the black.py file and appears to be a piece of a larger codebase. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes a `Line` object as input and is expected to return a tuple of two integers.

The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is checking the formatting of the source code, but it fails with an assertion error. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs are not matching. The error points to a discrepancy in the number of empty lines between comments and decorators in the source code.

Upon analyzing the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it seems to be responsible for inserting empty lines based on certain conditions related to the current and previous lines in the source code. The function seems to be overly complex and contains several conditional branches, making it difficult to reason about the exact behavior.

It appears that the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing incorrect empty line insertions, leading to the formatting mismatch indicated by the failing test.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to simplify the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that it correctly handles the conditions for inserting empty lines based on different types of lines in the source code.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return (2 if current_line.depth else 1), 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        return 2, 0

    return 0, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions for inserting empty lines have been simplified to ensure a clearer and more reliable behavior. By cleaning up the logic, it's more likely to address the formatting mismatch causing the failing test.
