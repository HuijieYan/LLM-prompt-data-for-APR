The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing the failing tests due to incorrect newlines being returned. The bugs are as follows:

1. When the function is called with `current_line.is_decorator = True` and `current_line.depth != 0`, it returns (2, 0) instead of (1, 0).
2. When the previous line is an import and the current line is not, and their depths are the same, it returns `(before or 1), 0` instead of `(before or 1), 0`.

To fix the bugs, you need to update the function to return the correct values based on the given input conditions as specified above.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.is_decorator and current_line.depth:
        # Function called with current_line.is_decorator = True and current_line.depth != 0
        return 1, 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        # Previous line is an import and current line is not + their depths are the same
        return (1 if before else 1), 0
    
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

The corrected function should now return the expected newlines values for the test cases provided.
