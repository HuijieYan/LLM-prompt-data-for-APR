The bug in the function _maybe_empty_lines appears to be related to issues with the assignment and initialization of the variable "before", as well as the handling of nested definitions and decorators.

The first case determines the value of "max_allowed" based on the depth of the current line, but the value of "before" is then reassigned irrespective of whether the current line has leaves. Additionally, the handling of self.previous_defs can lead to incorrect results. 

Based on the analysis, a potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve adjusting the conditional checks for deciding the value of "before", ensuring it is only reassigned when necessary. Additionally, proper handling of self.previous_defs while popping elements is needed.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In this version, we've updated the assignment of "before" based on the presence of leaves, ensuring correct handling for different cases. Additionally, the condition for popping elements from self.previous_defs during the while loop has been properly adjusted.
