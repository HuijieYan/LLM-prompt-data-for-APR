To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that all the expected variable values and types are correctly set before the function's return. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function that should pass the failing test:

```python
# import dataclass from the typing module
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: List
    prefix: str

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, leaf_type, value):
        self.leaf_type = leaf_type
        self.value = value

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """


    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line == None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import()
            and not current_line.is_import()
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield()
            and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected function, we fixed the conditions related to calling methods and class attributes, for example, `is_import`, `is_yield`, `is_flow_control`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`. We also handled the `self.previous_line` condition to check if it's `None`. The corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
