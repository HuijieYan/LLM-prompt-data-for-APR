The bug in the provided function is that it does not return the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to provide the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it's been observed that the function does not provide the correct output.

The possible cause of the bug can be traced to the logic within the function. There are multiple conditions and if-else statements that determine the number of empty lines, and it appears that these conditions are not providing the expected results based on the runtime input parameters and variable values.

To fix the bug, we will need to refactor the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that it accurately determines the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the input parameters and variable values.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
        
        # Condition to handle specific cases
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        elif current_line.is_import:
            if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                return before, 0
        elif current_line.is_yield:
            if self.previous_line and current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
                return before, 0
        elif current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line:
                if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                    return 0, 0
                elif current_line.depth:
                    return 1, 0
                else:
                    return 2, 0
        elif not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        # Default return values
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic within the function is refactored to handle specific cases and return the correct number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

This should resolve the bug and provide the correct output based on the input parameters and variable values.
