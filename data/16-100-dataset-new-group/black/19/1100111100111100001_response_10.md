The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not functioning correctly. It is supposed to determine whether empty lines should be inserted before a given line of code, but it is not achieving the expected result. This is indicated by failing test cases with assertion errors. The function consists of various conditional statements based on the properties of the current line of code.

The bug in this function seems to be related to the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert before a line of code. In some scenarios, the function is returning incorrect values for the number of empty lines to be inserted.

The cause of the bug is likely to be the inconsistent handling of edge cases and unexpected scenarios that involve the properties of the current and previous lines of code, as well as the method of modifying the `previous_defs` list.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements and the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before a line of code need to be reviewed and refactored. It is important to address the inconsistency and edge cases that might be leading to incorrect results.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Update the previous_defs list based on the current line
    if current_line.depth and self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        
    # Here, a series of conditional checks to determine the number of empty lines
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        # Additional checks and returns based on the current and previous lines
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (1 if max_allowed == 2 else 0), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (1 if max_allowed == 2 else 0), 0

    return 0, 0
```

In the corrected version, I've addressed the inconsistent handling of scenarios and the method of updating the `previous_defs` list. By adding additional checks and clarifying the conditional statements, the function should provide the correct number of empty lines to be inserted before a given line of code, resolving the bugs encountered in the failing tests.
