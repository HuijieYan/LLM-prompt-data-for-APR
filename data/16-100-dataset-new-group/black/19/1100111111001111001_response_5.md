The bug in the provided function lies in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert based on the current and previous lines. The logic is complex and makes it difficult to determine the expected behavior or fix the bug.

It seems the logic is intended to manage the indentation and presentation of Python code. However, a cleaner way to handle this logic would be to use a different approach that separates the handling of different concerns and simplifies the logic.

Since the function and its related classes are not provided, and the logic is complex, it may require significant refactoring.

Below is an attempt to fix the function based on the provided information:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # The below code is an approximation based on the information provided, it may need adjustment based on the actual class definitions and the intent of the logic.

    if current_line.is_decorated or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorated:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
            return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    elif self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_import:
            if not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                return 1, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_yield:
            if not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
                return 1, 0

    # Default values if no special conditions are met
    return 0, 0
```
The above code attempts to simplify the logic and separate different concerns, ensuring more clarity and easier maintenance.

However, the fix may not accurately represent the intended behavior due to the complexity of the original function and the absence of related class definitions.

To provide a more accurate and reliable fix, access to the full class definitions and a clear understanding of the intended behavior of the function is necessary.
