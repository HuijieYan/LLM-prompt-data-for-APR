## Issue Identification
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple conditional statements that determine the values of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` based on the conditions met within these statements. The incorrect values may be returned due to the complexity of conditional statements and the handling of these variables.

## Bug Causes
1. The conditional statements determining the values of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` are complex and may result in unexpected values.
2. The condition checking mechanisms might not be properly handling multi-parameter conditional statements, leading to incorrect assignments of `before` and `newlines`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Simplify the conditional statements to make the code more readable and maintainable.
2. Ensure that proper boolean algebra rules are followed when combining condition checks.
3. Consider defining the conditions in a more explicit and separate manner to avoid potential issues with assignments and checks.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if not self.previous_line:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
The corrected version of the function includes simplified conditional statements, proper handling of boolean conditions, and explicit identification of conditions and handling of values. This version should address the issues leading to incorrect outputs.
