The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the usage of `self.previous_line` and `current_line` properties. It also involves ensuring that empty lines are inserted before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.

The bug may be caused by how the function handles and compares the properties `self.previous_line` and the conditions set for determining when to insert empty lines.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the properties `self.previous_line` and `current_line` are being handled correctly, and that the conditions for inserting empty lines are accurately evaluated.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I've updated the conditions for checking whether the previous line is an import, by calling the `is_import()` function. I've also updated the condition for checking whether the previous line is a yield, again by calling the `is_yield()` function. I've ensured that the properties `self.previous_line` and `current_line` are being handled properly to accurately determine when to insert empty lines.
