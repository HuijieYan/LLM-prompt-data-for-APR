There seems to be a discrepancy between the code structure and the provided information. It appears that the class name and initialization of some classes are missing in the code and input data. However, I will still provide a fixed version of the function based on the available information.

Based on the provided code and input data, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be returning incorrect results, which causes the failing test cases. The incorrect results are due to the logic of handling and updating the variables `before` and `newlines` in the function.

It seems that the conditions for updating `before` and `newlines` are not properly handling the cases for decorators, flow control statements, and imports. Also, the handling of the `current_line.depth` and the stack `self.previous_defs` seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of updating the variables `before` and `newlines` based on the conditions provided in each case. Additionally, we need to properly handle the `current_line.depth` and update the stack `self.previous_defs` based on the conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with the original implementation and should now provide the expected outputs for the test cases.
