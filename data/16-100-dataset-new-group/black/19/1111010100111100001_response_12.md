The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines` defined within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This function is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function relies on multiple conditional checks and stateful tracking using class attributes.

The cause of the bug is related to the manipulation of the `depth` value and the conditions based on it. Additionally, the nested conditions are making it inefficient to track and update the state in this function correctly.

To fix the bug, a better strategy would be to refactor the function to use simpler conditional checks and to track the state in a more organized manner. By restructuring the logic and ensuring all paths are handled, the function can be refactored for clarity and improved performance.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.depth > 0 and self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    elif not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This refactored version of the function is more organized and covers all the possible execution paths, therefore solving the bug issue. Make sure to adjust and verify this function in your specific environment to ensure its correctness and functionality.
