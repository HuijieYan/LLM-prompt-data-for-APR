The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be adding extra newlines in certain cases, causing the assertion error in the failing test. The error message indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output, specifically complaining about extra newlines being added.


Potential error location:
- The calculation of `newlines` might be incorrect, leading to extra newlines being added in some cases.


Cause of the bug:
1. The `newlines` calculation does not consider all the conditions appropriately, which leads to the addition of extra newlines where it is not expected.
2. The `before` value may not be properly calculated in some scenarios, causing it to be larger than expected.


Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the conditions for calculating newlines and `before` values, ensuring that they are based on the correct logic.
2. Debug the function to identify which conditions are leading to the incorrect addition of newlines and adjust the logic accordingly.


Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, the newlines and `before` calculations have been adjusted based on the correct conditions to avoid adding extra newlines. Now, the function should behave as expected and pass the failing test.
