The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic inside the function does not correctly handle the conditions for adding empty lines and updating the `previous_defs` list. The function has conditions such as `if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` and `if current_line.is_flow_control` that do not accurately capture the necessary behavior for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

In addition, the function uses the `previous_defs` list in a way that is not consistent with the expected behavior, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

To fix the bug, the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be updated to accurately assess the conditions for adding empty lines and updating the `previous_defs` list. This can include adding conditions to handle specific scenarios and ensuring that the `previous_defs` list is updated correctly based on the current line's properties.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth - 1)
        else:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

The updates to the function include refining the conditions for adding empty lines based on the line's properties, as well as ensuring the `previous_defs` list is updated correctly. This corrected version should address the existing bug and pass the failing test.
