The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function might be difficult to identify without access to associated classes and methods. However, based on the given information, it seems that the bug concerns the incorrect computation of `newlines` in the case where `current_line.is_decorator` is true or when `current_line.is_def` or `current_line.is_class` is true. It also seems that it's related to considerations of empty lines and depths.

Given this analysis, it seems that the computation of `newlines` and possibly other conditions within the function `_maybe_empty_lines` need to be revisited and potentially recalibrated based on the input parameters and defined classes.

Here is a possible correction to the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The above correction simplifies the logic for calculating `max_allowed` and `before`, and primarily addresses the erroneous computation of `newlines`. This should address the issues identified in the failing test cases. However, it's important to further verify these corrections with thorough testing.
