The current function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be incorrectly handling the insertion of empty lines based on certain conditions. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` seems to be showing a mismatch between the expected and actual output, specifically related to the placement of empty lines and comments within decorators.

The potential error locations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could be the conditions and logic for inserting empty lines based on the type of line, depth, and previous lines.

The failing test indicates that there is an issue with the placement of empty lines and comments within decorators. The error message includes the specific differences in the expected and actual output, showcasing the incorrect placement of empty lines and comments.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for inserting empty lines and ensure that it correctly handles the placement of comments within decorators and other structural elements in the code.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth:
            before = 1
        else:
            before = 2

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class or current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I've adjusted the logic for handling decorators and ensured that the insertion of empty lines follows the expected behavior as described in the failing test. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
