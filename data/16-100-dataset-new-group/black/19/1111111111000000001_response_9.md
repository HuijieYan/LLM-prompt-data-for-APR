To fix the buggy function, we can follow these steps:

1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code, and the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function by looking for discrepancies between the expected behavior and the actual behavior based on its logic and usage within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
3. Explain the cause of the bug by considering the conditions and comparisons made within the function and how they may affect the returned results. Review the related functions and the failing test to understand the expected behavior.
4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug based on addressing the identified potential error locations and ensuring that the function's logic aligns with the expected behavior.
5. Provide a corrected version of the buggy function.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- Changed the function calls `current_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_yield` to `current_line.is_import()`, `current_line.is_yield()` respectively to correctly call the methods defined within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
- Adjusted the condition checks and comparisons to ensure they align with the intended logic and expected behavior.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should address the potential errors and pass the failing test.
