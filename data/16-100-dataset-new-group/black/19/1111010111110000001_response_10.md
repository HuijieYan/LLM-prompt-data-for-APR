The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be causing an assertion error in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test in the `test_black.py` file. The actual and expected output do not match, and the error message indicates a difference in the number of empty lines.

The potential error locations within the `maybe_empty_lines` function are related to the logic that calculates the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. It seems that the logic for computing the number of empty lines is not accurate, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output in the test.

The cause of the bug could be that the logic inside the `maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the computation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This leads to incorrect formatting of the output, causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be reviewed and updated to accurately calculate the number of empty lines before and after the current line, taking into account different scenarios such as decorators, flow control, import statements, yield statements, etc.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_flow_control or self.previous_line.is_import:
            before += 1
        elif self.previous_line.is_yield and current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            before += 1
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            if current_line.depth > 0:
                before += 1
            else:
                before += 2
        after = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        after = 1
    elif current_line.is_import and (not self.previous_line or not self.previous_line.is_import or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        before += 1
    
    return before, after
```

This corrected version of the function should accurately calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, considering different scenarios and conditions. It should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output.
