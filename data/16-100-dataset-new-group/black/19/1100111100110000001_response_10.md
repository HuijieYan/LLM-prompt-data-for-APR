The cause of the bug:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `current_line` object and its attributes, as well as the incorrect comparisons and conditions for returning the number of newlines and indentation changes. This can result in incorrect formatting of the code, leading to failing test cases.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the usage of the `current_line` object and its attributes to ensure they are being accessed and compared correctly.
2. Review the conditions for returning the number of newlines and indentation changes to ensure they are properly handled for different types of lines (decorators, imports, flow control, etc.).

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def() or current_line.is_class():
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control():
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(0)
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- Correct method calls are made to check if the current line is a decorator, def, class, import, flow control, or yield.
- The conditions for returning the number of newlines and indentation changes are handled with appropriate comparisons and checks for different cases.
