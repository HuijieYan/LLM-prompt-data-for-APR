## Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is meant to determine the number of newlines to insert before a given line of code. It considers various conditions such as whether the current line is a decorator, def, yield, import, flow control or a regular line of code.

The issues in the function might be leading to incorrect determinations of the number of newlines to insert, as detected by the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.

The detected issues include:
1. In case 1, `newlines` is always set to 2, which is incorrect.
2. In case 3, `newlines` is not set, leading to the incorrect return value.
3. In case 7, `newlines` is also not being set correctly.

The strategy for fixing these issues is to review the logic of the function, and correct the determinations of the `newlines` variable based on the specific conditions for decorators, def, and other types of code lines.

## Correction
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        # Corrected logic to set newlines based on the conditions
        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines = 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
