The cause of the bug is that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` does not correctly return the expected output based on the input parameters for the different cases. The function contains multiple conditional statements trying to determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, but the logic inside these conditional statements is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix this, the conditional statements and their logic need to be restructured to accurately determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on its attributes and contextual information.

Below is the fixed version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function has been rewritten based on the original logic, but with adjustments to correctly determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on its characteristics and the contextual information.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        after = 0
        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                before = 0
            else:
                before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        before = 1
        after = 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            before = 1
        else:
            before = 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            before = 1
        else:
            before = 0
    elif current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    return before, after
```

This version should correct the issues of the original `_maybe_empty_lines` function and produce the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line for the given test cases.
