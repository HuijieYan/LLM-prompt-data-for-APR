The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the logic used to determine the empty lines to be inserted in the returned tuple. The expected output is based on certain conditions of the current_line and the self.previous_line variables.

The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple condition checks and assignments that may not handle all possible scenarios correctly. It also modifies the `before` variable based on various conditions, and it may not always reflect the intended behavior.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to review and re-implement the logic used in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, focusing on the condition checks and assignments related to `max_allowed`, `before`, and the conditions regarding `current_line` and `self.previous_line`. Consider using specific test cases to verify the correctness of the function.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version aims to address the issues identified in the original function by simplifying the assignment of the `before` variable and by re-implementing the condition checks based on the expected behavior of `current_line` and `self.previous_line`. This version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
