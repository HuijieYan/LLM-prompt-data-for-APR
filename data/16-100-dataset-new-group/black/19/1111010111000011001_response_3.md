Following are the potential areas for error in the given function:
1. The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator` doesn't appear to have an `else` block associated with it, which could be problematic.
2. The assignment `before = 1 if depth else 2` could be incorrect, as it sets `before` to 1 if `depth` is truthy, and 2 if `depth` is falsy.
3. The logic within the `while` loop seems to have an incorrect ordering.

The cause of the bug is that the logic within the function is not handling the different cases properly, leading to incorrect output values.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Ensure that appropriate `if-else` conditions are used in all places where required.
2. Correctly handle the assignment of the `before` variable based on the conditions being met.
3. Address the ordering issues within the `while` loop and ensure it operates as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before if before else 1, 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before if before else 1, 0
    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version, the conditions for each case are appropriately handled, the ordering within the while loop is adjusted, and the assignment of the `before` variable is fixed. This should resolve the issues and the function is expected to pass the failing test.
