The cause of the error can be identified from the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` from the class `EmptyLineTracker`. Currently, the function does not handle all cases properly, such as decorator handling and inserting empty lines according to certain conditions. This leads to incorrect formatting, and the error suggests that the actual output does not match the expected output.

To fix the error, I would suggest reviewing the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and re-implementing the logic to handle all cases properly to match with the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    # Checks if the current line's depth is 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.update_previous_defs(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected function updates the logic around handling decorators and determining the number of newlines. The `update_previous_defs` function is called to handle the addition of previous definitions. This solution should fix the bug and make the function follow the expected behavior.
