The bug in the provided function is likely related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` contains several conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines based on different conditions related to the current and previous lines. However, the values of the variables `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` and the manipulation of the `previous_defs` list within the function are causing discrepancies in the expected and actual outputs.

The cause of the bug appears to be the incorrect handling of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` variables, and the improper manipulation of the `previous_defs` list based on the given cases.

To fix the bug in the function, we can update the conditional statements and variable assignments based on the conditional checks to accurately compute the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.depth > 0 and self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected function uses proper conditional checks to determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, and minimizes discrepancies in the expected and actual outputs.
