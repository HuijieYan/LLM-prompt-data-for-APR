The issue seems to be in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which is a member of the `EmptyLineTracker` class provided. The function is intended to calculate the number of potential empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. There are several potential error locations that we need to identify.

Reviewing the code and the failing test, it appears that the issue arises from the calculation of newlines and empty lines before and after the currently processed line. In particular, the conditional checks and calculations may not be accurately responding to the type of the current line or the nature of the previous line.

The `before` variable is set based on different conditions, including handling of decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields. The error message from the failing test shows that the formatting is not as expected, which might suggest that these conditions are not correctly handled in the `maybe_empty_lines` function.

To address this issue: 
1. Now that we have identified the potential error locations and the cause of the bug which includes an incorrect conditional check for various properties of the current line and the previous line, we should modify these checks to ensure that the appropriate actions are taken for each condition.
2. We should also ensure that the indentation levels and newlines are handled correctly to match the expected formatting.
3. It appears that the code for updating the `before` variable and subsequent return values could be simplified and handled more accurately.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Set max_allowed based on current_line.depth
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    # Handle previous_defs and depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        
    # Handle decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields conditions
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This updated version of the function now includes corrections to the conditional checks and calculations, ensuring that the appropriate actions are taken for each condition. It also addresses the handling of decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields more accurately while simplifying the logic for updating the `before` variable and returning the correct values.

By implementing these changes, we aim to resolve the issues observed in the failing test cases.
