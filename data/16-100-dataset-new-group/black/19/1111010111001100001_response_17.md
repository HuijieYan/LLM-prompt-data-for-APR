The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by the incorrect computation of the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function contains various conditional checks to determine the number of empty lines to insert, but the logic is incorrect.

The bug is evident from the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` where the expected and actual output do not match. Based on the provided runtime input/output variable values for the function, the bug seems to stem from the incorrect computation of the `before` value and the logic related to detecting decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to carefully review the logic for each conditional check in the function and ensure that it accurately computes the number of newlines to insert before and after the currently processed line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function should address the incorrect logic and computation issues, resulting in passing the failing test.
