The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be related to the incorrect handling of `self.previous_defs`. The initial value of `max_allowed` is being reassigned based on the `current_line.depth` value, and then a series of conditionals determine the number of empty lines to be inserted. However, it seems that the logic for adjusting the number of empty lines based on the `depth` and the `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` attributes of `current_line`, as well as the `self.previous_line` attribute, is incorrect.

The potential locations of the bug are focused primarily on the conditional blocks that modify the `newlines` and `before` variables based on the specified criteria. It seems that the conditions aren't handling all possible scenarios correctly, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks in the function need to be carefully reviewed to ensure that they are handling all combinations of the attributes of `current_line` and `self.previous_line` correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version of the function, the conditional blocks have been adjusted to handle the various conditions and attribute combinations correctly.

By carefully ensuring that all possible combinations of conditions are handled appropriately, we can address the issues present in the original function and prevent unexpected behaviors from occurring.
