The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be causing incorrect insertion of new lines in the output based on the input provided. By analyzing the test cases and the runtime values of input parameters and variables, it is clear that the function is not producing the expected result when it comes to the number of newlines and how they are inserted in the output.

One potential error in the function might be the logic that decides how many newlines to insert based on various conditions. The calculations for the `before` and `newlines` variables might be incorrect.

The strategy to fix the bug could involve revisiting the conditional statements that determine the value of `before` and `newlines` based on different conditions. These conditions might need to be thoroughly reviewed and adjusted if they are not correctly modeling the desired behavior for output formatting.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the analysis:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else max_allowed

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By revisiting the conditional statements and logic for `before` and `newlines`, a corrected version of the function that should address the bug has been provided. Please note that placeholders such as `Line`, `Leaf`, etc. should be replaced with the actual classes used in the code.
