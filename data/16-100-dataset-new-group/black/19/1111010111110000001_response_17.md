This buggy function is inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is intended to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the counting of empty lines and may be returning an incorrect number of empty lines.

The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes a `current_line` argument of type `Line` and should return a tuple of integers representing the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

The potential error locations within the function include:
1. Inconsistent handling of `before` variable.
2. Unnecessary reassignment of `newlines` variable.
3. Inconsistent return values based on conditional branches.

The failing test provides the error message indicating an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual output. The primary cause of this bug may be the inconsistent computation of empty lines before and after the current line, leading to incorrect formatting in the output.

To fix the bug, the counting of empty lines should be revised to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is calculated before and after the current line based on the defined conditions in the function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the computation of the `before` variable and ensures that the logic for returning the number of empty lines before and after the current line is consistent with the defined conditions. With these adjustments, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
