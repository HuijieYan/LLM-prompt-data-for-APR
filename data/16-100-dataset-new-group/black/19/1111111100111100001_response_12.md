The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` contains multiple logical errors that lead to incorrect output. After analyzing the function and the test cases, the cause of the bugs appears to be the incorrect handling of the conditions related to indentation depth, line types, and previous line properties.

Based on the input parameters and the runtime values, the following issues have been identified:

1. The `max_allowed` variable is incorrectly assigned based on the condition `if current_line.depth == 0`. This might lead to incorrect values for `max_allowed`, affecting the subsequent logic in the function.

2. The handling of indentation depth (`depth`) and previous definitions (`self.previous_defs`) seems to be incorrect. This affects the correct determination of the number of potential extra empty lines.

3. The conditions for identifying line types such as decorator, def, yield, import, and flow control are not handled correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bugs, the logical errors present in handling the indentation depth, line types, and previous definitions need to be addressed.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    if not current_line.leaves:
        before = 0
    else:
        before = min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        current_line.leaves[0].prefix = ""
    
    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for evaluating the line types and handling the indentation depth has been updated to ensure correct determination of the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the line.

This corrected version should resolve the logical errors and produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
