The bug in the given function seems to be causing an incorrect number of empty lines to be computed. This leads to an assertion error when comparing expected and actual texts, as seen in the error message from the failing test.

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing tests, it seems that the bug arises from incorrect logic when computing the number of empty lines required before and after the currently processed line.

Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it's observed that the logic for computing the number of empty lines is not consistent with the expected behavior. The bug appears to be related to the computation of `before` and `newlines` values within the function, leading to incorrect results when compared to the expected output.

To fix the bug, the logic for computing the `before` and `newlines` values needs to incorporate the correct conditions and calculations based on the input parameters. Additionally, attention should be paid to how `depth`, `max_allowed`, `is_decorator`, and other condition variables are handled.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Declare the class containing the bug-fixed function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet. It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines. Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        before = 0
        newlines = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            newlines = 1
        elif (
            self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            newlines = before or 1
        elif (
            self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            newlines = before or 1
        
        return before, newlines
```

In the corrected version, the `before` and `newlines` variables are computed based on the conditions and interpreted more coherently, ensuring a consistent logic for the expected behavior. This changes the way the `before` and `newlines` values are processed and returned, addressing the bug.

After applying these changes, running the test will verify if the corrected version of the function passes the failing test.
