Based on the analysis, the following observation is made:
- The bug appears to be related to the conditional logic that sets the `newlines` value. Specifically, when it checks `if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class`, and then within the conditional body, it is determining that `newlines` should be 2, but the return value is not explicitly set.

Hence, in order to fix this bug, the `newlines` and `inside_import` variables need to be set with the correct values based on the conditional statements.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    inside_import = self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 1
        return 2, 1

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if inside_import:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version takes into account the conditions and ensures that the correct values of `newlines` and `inside_import` are determined based on the conditionals. This should resolve the bug and help the function pass the failing test.
