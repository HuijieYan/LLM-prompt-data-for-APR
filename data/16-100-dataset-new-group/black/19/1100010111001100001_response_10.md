The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines based on the state of the input line and the previous lines.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Not properly handling the condition when neither `is_decorator`, `is_def`, or `is_class` are True.
2. Incorrectly resetting the `before` variable when popping from `self.previous_defs` list.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted is incorrect in some cases. This causes the function to produce incorrect outputs when called for certain input values, leading to the failing test cases.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to review the entire logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted and ensure that it takes into account all necessary conditions and follows the desired behavior as described in the requirements.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else max_allowed
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_def_or_class = current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class
    
    if is_def_or_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
