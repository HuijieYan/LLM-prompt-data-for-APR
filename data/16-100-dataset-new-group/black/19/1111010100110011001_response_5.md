The bug in the given function arises due to incorrect handling of the `before` variable, which is expected to store the number of potential extra empty lines needed before the currently processed line. The `before` variable is being incorrectly reassigned in the while loop, leading to incorrect values. 

To fix the bug, we need to reorganize the logic surrounding the `before` variable and properly handle its assignment. We also need to ensure that the `max_allowed` variable is correctly set based on whether `current_line.depth` is 0 or not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else max_allowed
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the assignment and manipulation of the `before` variable, ensuring that it maintains the correct value for the number of potential extra empty lines needed. Additionally, the `max_allowed` variable is correctly set based on the depth of the current line. These changes should address the bug and ensure that the function satisfies the expected input/output values.
