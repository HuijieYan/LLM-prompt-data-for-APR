The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how it handles the `previous_defs` list and the values of `max_allowed` and `newlines`. The function sets `before` to 1 if `depth` is truthy, and 2 otherwise, inside the `while` loop to adjust the value of `before` before returning them. The function calculates `newlines` as 2 and decreases it by 1 if `depth` is not falsy. Also, it seems that there is a bug in the logic that sets the `previous_defs` list in association with the `self` object. Based on these findings, the bug likely occurs due to how the function handles previous definitions and the calculation of the number of empty lines. 

A potential strategy for fixing the bug might involve reworking the logic related to the calculation of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines`, as well as ensuring that the `previous_defs` list is updated and associated correctly with the `self` object.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(bool(current_line.depth))
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version revises the calculation of `newlines` and the handling of the `previous_defs` list. It calculates `newlines` directly without decreasing it instead of the previous approach, and updates the `previous_defs` list in a more appropriate manner.
