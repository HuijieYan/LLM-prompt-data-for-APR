The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from misinterpreting the logic for when to return `newlines` and `before` values. The function incorrectly sets the `newlines` value to `2` based on the conditions that arise when the `is_decorator` flag is set. If the `is_decorator` flag is set, it then checks for `current_line.depth`, which seems to be an incorrect conditional path and causes the return values to be incorrect.

Potential approches for fixing the bug are:
- Revise the conditional checks for `is_decorator` and `current_line.depth` to ensure they align with the expected behaviour.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Initialize variables
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    
    # Logic for handling decorators, classes, functions
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        return newlines, before

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This revised version should correct the previous misinterpretation and properly handle the conditional checks within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Now, it should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the bug.
