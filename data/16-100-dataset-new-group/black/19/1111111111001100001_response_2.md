The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have a logical error as it does not return the expected output for certain inputs. The cases provided show that the behavior of the function is not consistent with its expected behavior according to the failing test cases. The issue likely stems from the logic used to determine the number of empty lines that need to be inserted before and after the currently processed line.

Based on the test cases and the inputs provided, it seems that the logic within the function may not be correctly accounting for certain conditions, such as the relationship between the current line and the previous line, additional leaf properties, and the depth of the current line.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that it correctly handles the scenarios for which the failing test cases were identified.

Here's one potential fix for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(max_allowed, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(max_allowed, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0
    
    return max(max_allowed, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0
```

This fixed version modifies the logic to handle different cases more precisely and consistently. The core changes include handling of decorators, flow control, import, and yield, while also factoring in the `max_allowed` condition based on indentation. This refactoring should address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
