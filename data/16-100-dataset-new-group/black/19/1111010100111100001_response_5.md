#### Plan for fixing the bug
The bug appears to be in the logic of `_maybe_empty_lines` function when it determines the number of empty lines that should appear before and after the currently processed line. The function has some conditional statements and calculations which may not be correctly handling different scenarios.

The input parameters `current_line`, `current_line.depth`, and `self.previous_line` seem to be at the core of the logic that determines the outcome. 

In order to fix this bug, the logic within the function needs to be reviewed and possibly refactored. It needs to correctly handle different code structures, decorators, def, yield, and import statements to ensure a consistent and appropriate calculation of the number of empty lines.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the function deals explicitly with different code structures. It avoids unnecessary calculations and focuses on providing a consistent and appropriate number of empty lines based on the context in question.
