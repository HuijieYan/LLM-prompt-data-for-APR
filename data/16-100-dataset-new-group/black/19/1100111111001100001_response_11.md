The buggy function appears to be checking the values of `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, and `current_line.is_class` to determine the appropriate number of empty lines to return. However, there seems to be some confusion in the logic, as well as the incorrect ingestion of the `self.previous_line` attribute in certain cases.

It is assumed that the aim of the function is to return the appropriate number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. 

In order to fix the bug, the key approach would be to carefully assess the intended behavior and to correct the control flows and condition checks accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    # Check the depth of the current line, and adjust max_allowed
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # If there are leaves in the line
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Clean up the previous_defs list based on the current depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    # Determine if the line is a decorator, def, or class
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_def = current_line.is_def
    is_class = current_line.is_class

    if is_decorator or is_def or is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues with the original function and provide the expected behavior based on the analysis.

Make sure to have a test plan to validate the new code and ensure that it behaves as expected.
