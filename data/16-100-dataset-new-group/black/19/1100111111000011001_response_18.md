To fix the buggy function, let's first identify and address the potential error locations. We can see that there are several function calls within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, such as `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, `current_line.is_class`, `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, and `current_line.is_yield`. These function calls are possibly causing the issue.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the conditions and flow control within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Additionally, there are issues with reassigning values to variables such as `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator`.

We need to ensure that the conditions and logical flow within the function are properly handled. Additionally, we should carefully evaluate the logic to determine the correct values of variables before returning from the function. Furthermore, the comparison of `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` may also be contributing to the issue.

To correct the bug, we should carefully re-evaluate the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and consider reassigning appropriate values to variables based on the logic conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    # Modify the logic accordingly based on the expected return values
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    else:
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        elif (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        else:
            return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic within the function has been properly revised to ensure that appropriate values are assigned to the variables based on the conditions. Additionally, the return statements have been adjusted based on the expected variable values and types.

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test provided.
