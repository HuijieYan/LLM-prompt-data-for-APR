The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not properly handling the insertion of empty lines in the source code. This is leading to a failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` which is expecting a different output than what the function is providing.

The potential error locations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function are in the conditional statements and the block of code where the number of newlines is calculated based on different conditions.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements and the logic for calculating the number of newlines to be inserted are not properly handling all the cases, leading to incorrect insertion of newlines and resulting in a failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing the conditional statements and the logic for calculating the number of newlines to ensure that all the cases are properly handled and the correct number of newlines is inserted based on the conditions specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the handling of different cases has been improved, and the conditional statements for inserting newlines have been modified to address the issues that were causing the failing test.
