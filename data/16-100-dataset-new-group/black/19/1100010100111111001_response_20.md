The bug is caused by incorrect logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is designed to return the number of newlines to insert before a line and after a line. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct number of newlines are returned based on the conditions specified in the code. Specifically, we need to check the current line's attributes and apply the correct logic to determine the number of newlines to insert.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if (
        self.previous_line is None
        or self.previous_line.is_decorator
        or self.previous_line.is_import
        or not current_line.depth
        or current_line.is_def
        or current_line.is_class
    ):
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_yield and current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 0, 0

    max_allowed = 1 if not current_line.leaves else 2
    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
    before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed) if current_line.leaves else 0
    first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if (
        not current_line.is_decorator
        and not current_line.is_def
        and not current_line.is_class
    ):
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

    newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
    return newlines - 1, 0
```

The corrected function includes checks for various conditions to determine the number of newlines to insert. It returns the fixed number of newlines based on the conditions specified. This version should satisfy the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
