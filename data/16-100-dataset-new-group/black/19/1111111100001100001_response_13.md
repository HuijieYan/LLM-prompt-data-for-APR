The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. Based on the provided runtime values and the function's code, the bug occurs because the function does not correctly compute the before and after values. It adjusts the `before` variable without considering all possible conditions and does not appropriately handle the updating of the `self.previous_defs` attribute or the specific cases for `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_flow_control`, and certain comparisons with `self.previous_line` attributes.

A potential fix for this bug may involve revising the conditional statements within the function to properly handle the different cases. The function should be updated to correctly evaluate the cases for `before` as well as the conditions that involve `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line`. Updating these conditional statements and ensuring proper handling of the possible variable values should resolve the bug.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```
