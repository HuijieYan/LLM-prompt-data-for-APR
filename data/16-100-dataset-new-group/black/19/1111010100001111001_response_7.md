Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0
    
    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    
    if (self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator) or (current_line.depth and not current_line.is_decorator):
        newlines = 2
        newlines -= current_line.depth
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth) or (self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield and current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

The issue with the original implementation is that it was returning an incorrect value when it encountered certain conditions such as the presence of decorators or when checking the conditions involving import and yield statements. The corrected function now checks for these conditions and returns the expected values according to the specified logic and test cases.
