To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address the following potential causes of the bug:

1. The logic for handling the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line might be incorrect, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

2. The conditions for checking whether the current line is a decorator, import, class, def, flow control, or yield might be incorrect, causing unexpected behavior in the function.

To ensure that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function works correctly, we need to fix the conditions and the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function: 
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def():
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator():
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_class():
            if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator():
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control():
            return before, 1
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import() and not current_line.is_import() and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield() and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- We have replaced `current_line.is_decorator` with `current_line.is_decorator()`, `current_line.is_def` with `current_line.is_def()`, `current_line.is_class` with `current_line.is_class()`, etc., to call the functions and correctly check the condition.
- We have fixed the conditions for checking whether the current line is a decorator, def, class, flow control, or yield, to ensure the correct behavior of the function.
- We have updated the logic to handle the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the type of the current line.

With these corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test.
