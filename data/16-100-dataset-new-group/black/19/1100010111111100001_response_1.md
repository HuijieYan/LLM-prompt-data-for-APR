The bug arises from the function `_maybe_empty_lines` which handles deciding how many empty lines to insert in a Python source file. The issue seems to be the inconsistent handling of empty lines, especially when dealing with decorators and yielding.

The method seems to be using the `before` variable inconsistently for different scenarios, contributing to the unexpected output. Additionally, the handling of `newlines` seems to be inconsistent too. The `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditions may need to be reviewed and corrected to ensure consistent behavior.

Based on the failing test and input/output values, it is apparent that the function is returning incorrect values for the number of newlines to be inserted.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to review the logic for all the conditional statements and ensure that the correct number of newlines and empty lines are consistently calculated and returned based on the input conditions.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling empty lines and newlines has been reviewed and updated to ensure consistent behavior. This should address the issues observed in the failing test and runtime input/output values.

By addressing the inconsistencies in handling the `before` variable and ensuring that newlines are correctly calculated and returned, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
