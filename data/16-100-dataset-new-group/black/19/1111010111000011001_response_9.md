The code provided contains a class `EmptyLineTracker` with a buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` that needs to be fixed. The function is expected to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, based on various conditions.

From the code, it seems that the function is getting confused between the usage of `max_allowed` where sometimes its value is intended to be 1 and sometimes 2. In the first conditional block, the value of `max_allowed` is being set to 2 if `current_line.depth` is 0, and for other cases, it defaults to 1. However, this switching of values is not consistent with the logic of the rest of the function.

This inconsistency can lead to incorrect behavior based on the value of `max_allowed` at different points in the function leading to possible bugs.

To fix this, we will update the logic of the function to use a consistent value for `max_allowed` and resolve the conditional blocks based on it.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if (
        is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class
    ):
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable values and pass the failing tests.
