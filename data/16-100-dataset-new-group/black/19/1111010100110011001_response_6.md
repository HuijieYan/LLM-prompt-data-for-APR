The bug appears to be related to the computation of empty lines before and after the current line. From the failing test case, we can see that the newlines are not being inserted correctly, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the computation of empty lines before and after the current line is correctly handled in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the current line should be revisited and corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    
    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if depth not in self.previous_defs:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    if current_line.depth:
        newlines = 1
    else:
        newlines = 2
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, newlines
```

In the corrected version, we have adjusted the logic for computing empty lines based on the current and previous lines. The conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields have been modified to correctly determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

The corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values, without encountering the error mentioned in the failing test.
