The bug seems to be related to the computation of the number of empty lines. It is expecting certain conditions to be met but the logical flow and the checks do not fully fulfill these conditions.

Looking at the cases, we can identify that the `before` value should be the minimum of `before` and `max_allowed`. However, the current implementation does not handle this effectively. Additionally, the condition `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth` should be corrected to have an appropriate logic.

The bug can be fixed by updating the `while` loop to execute as long as `self.previous_defs` is not empty and the last value in `self.previous_defs` is greater than or equal to `depth`. Also, the computation to update `before` should use the `min` function to get the minimum of `before` and `max_allowed`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
