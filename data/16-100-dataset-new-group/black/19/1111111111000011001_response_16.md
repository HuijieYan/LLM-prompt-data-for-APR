Based on your explanations, I understand that there are a few issues in the `EmptyLineTracker` class and its associated functions. The primary problem is that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the conditional checks.

Here's the strategy to fix the bug:

1. Modify the conditional checks so that they correctly evaluate the expected conditions based on the input parameters and instances of the `EmptyLineTracker` class (self).
2. Ensure that the functions called within `_maybe_empty_lines` such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, `is_yield`, `append`, etc., are also defined correctly in the associated class.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or
            depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected function, I have modified the conditional checks for checking whether `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. Additionally, I have modified the assignment of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` based on the conditions provided in the failing test cases. Now, the function should behave as expected and pass the failing test cases.
