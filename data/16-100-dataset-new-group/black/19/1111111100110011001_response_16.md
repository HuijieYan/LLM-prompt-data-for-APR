The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that need to be addressed. The following is a detailed analysis of potential error locations and their causes:

1. The `max_allowed` variable is initially set to `1`, but should take the value `2` when `current_line.depth` equals `0`. This value is changed based on the condition, but there is no guarantee it will be set to the correct value.
2. The `before` variable is set to `0` when `current_line.leaves` is empty, but takes a value based on `first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")`. The condition checking for an empty `current_line.leaves` may not be reliable, and therefore `before` can be incorrectly set.
3. The handling of `is_decorator` has a conditional check for setting `newlines`, but `is_decorator` is used conditionally multiple times.
4. The method seems to rely on some potentially undefined behavior in the previous classes, which could lead to unexpected results and errors.

To fix the issues with the buggy function, the following changes should be made:

1. Ensure that the correct values are assigned to `max_allowed`. Make it explicit when and how the value changes based on the `depth` condition.
2. Verify that the correct condition and value of `before` are used based on the leaves.
3. Revise conditional checks involving `is_decorator` and set a value to `newlines` explicitly.
4. Address the reliance on potentially undefined behavior in the previous classes and take necessary precautions, such as guarding against `None` values.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

    newlines = 0
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines = 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        newlines = before or 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        newlines = before or 1

    return before, newlines
```

The corrected function should pass the failing test and provide the expected input/output values stated for the different cases.
