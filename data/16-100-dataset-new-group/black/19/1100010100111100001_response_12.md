The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is caused by the incorrect determination of the maximum allowable blank lines. The function incorrectly reduces the `max_allowed` value to 2 if the `current_line` has a depth of 0, but that is not the intended behavior. Additionally, during multiple checks, the function overwrites the `before` variable, which leads to incorrect determination of the number of empty lines to be inserted.

Based on the analysis of the runtime input/output values, it can be seen that the function is incorrectly handling the maximum allowed blank lines and the `before` variable.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to adjust the logic for determining the `max_allowed` value based on the depth of `current_line` and also modify the checks to not overwrite the `before` variable unnecessarily.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.depth:
            max_allowed = 1
        else:
            max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        return before, 0

    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for determining `max_allowed` value is adjusted based on the type of `current_line`. Additionally, the `before` variable is not unnecessarily overwritten in different conditional checks, which ensures correct evaluation of the number of empty lines to be inserted in different scenarios.
