From the error message and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it is evident that the `before` and `max_allowed` variables are being used to determine the number of newlines and spaces to insert at various locations in the code. The code is failing to correctly determine the number of newlines and spaces to insert, resulting in incorrect formatting, leading to assertion errors.

The cause of the bug seems to stem from the incorrect assignments and conditional checks within the function, specifically in the part where it determines the behavior for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields. The conditions for these cases are not being accurately evaluated, leading to the incorrect insertion of newlines and spaces in the output, causing the test cases to fail.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditions and assignments inside the function in such a way that the correct behavior can be determined based on the input. This might involve refactoring the code to use a more modular approach where each case is handled individually based on the specific conditions and requirements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, before), 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, before), 0
    else:
        return before, 0

    return newlines, 0
```

With this corrected version, the function should more accurately handle the insertion of newlines and spaces, leading to correct formatting of the code and passing of the failing test cases.
