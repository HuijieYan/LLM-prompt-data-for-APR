The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from the conditionals that update the `before` variable. These conditionals are not consistent with the expected behavior and are causing the incorrect values to be assigned to `before` in the return statement of the function.

The following strategy can be employed to fix the bug:
1. Break down the function into parts and analyze what each part is doing.
2. Identify the areas where the `before` variable is being updated and determine whether the conditions are accurate.
3. Modify the conditions to properly interpret the requirements for updating the `before` variable.
4. Ensure that the return statement for each conditional condition is also updated according to the new conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function incorporating the suggested fixes:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the revised version, the conditions for updating the `before` variable and the associated return statements have been corrected to ensure that the expected behavior is achieved.
