The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues:
1. It makes reference to attributes and methods that are part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, but the function is not defined within the class itself.
2. It uses `self` references, indicating that it is supposed to be an instance method, yet it is not defined as such.
3. The condition `if current_line.leaves` is not properly handling the case where `current_line.leaves` is empty or None.
4. The function contains multiple logical conditions and manipulations based on some attributes from the class, which are not appropriately initialized before being used.
5. The usage of `return 0, 0` and `return 0, 0` within the function based on some conditions is unclear and might lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix these issues, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be moved inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class and properly defined as an instance method. Also, the logic of the function should be adjusted to handle the edge cases where class attributes may not be initialized.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if not getattr(current_line, 'leaves', None):
            before = 0
        else:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        if not hasattr(self, 'previous_defs'):
            self.previous_defs = []
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = getattr(current_line, 'is_decorator', False)
        
        if is_decorator or getattr(current_line, 'is_def', False) or getattr(current_line, 'is_class', False):
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if not getattr(self, 'previous_line', None):
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and getattr(self.previous_line, 'is_decorator', False):
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if getattr(current_line, 'is_flow_control', False):
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and getattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import', False)
            and not getattr(current_line, 'is_import', False)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and getattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield', False)
            and (not getattr(current_line, 'is_yield', False) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I made sure to handle the cases where attributes or methods might not exist, added proper initialization checks, and moved the function inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class as an instance method. I also adjusted the usage of `self` references to correctly access instance attributes and used the `getattr` method to handle potential issues when accessing attributes.
