The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is comparing values and updating variables incorrectly. The function may not be correctly handling the case where `is_decorator` is True, `self.previous_line` is None, and `self.previous_line.is_decorator` is True. The function also seems to be calculating the number of newlines incorrectly due to a misunderstanding of the logical structure of the code it's analyzing.

A potential fix for the bug is to adjust the logic of the block that checks for decorators and their location. It should account for the possibility of `self.previous_line` being None and `self.previous_line.is_decorator` being True. Additionally, the calculation of newlines should be reviewed for correctness.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should handle the case of decorators correctly and calculate newlines based on the logical structure of the code more accurately. The corrected function is expected to pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
