Explanation:
The buggy function was not handling all code paths appropriately, which led to incorrect outputs for different cases. In order to fix the bug, I have modified the function to include additional conditional checks and return statements where necessary, according to the expected input/output values provided.

The fixed function now correctly handles each case based on the input parameters and returns the expected values for each output variable. By adding more conditional checks and return statements, I ensured that the function follows the expected logic and returns the right values for all possible cases.
