The function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a bug in the way it updates the `before` value in the condition `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:` and in the condition `if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:`. Additionally, the function is unable to correctly handle different combinations of previous and current line attributes which causes the test cases to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly updates the `before` variable when the condition `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:` and when evaluating `current_line.is_decorator` or `current_line.is_def` or `current_line.is_class`. Additionally, the function does not consider multiple combinations of previous and current line attributes which invalidates the computation of expected vs. actual results. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements, primarily focusing on updating the `before` variable when the first leaf has extra newlines and when evaluating `current_line.is_decorator` or `current_line.is_def` or `current_line.is_class`. We also need to handle different combinations of previous and current line attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.replace("\n", "")
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues within the function and pass the failing test cases.
