The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines and the conditions for when to insert them. The failing test, `test_comment_in_decorator`, suggests that the function is not correctly handling comments within decorators.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that it correctly handles all the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the processed line. Additionally, it needs to properly handle comments within decorators.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if (
            self.previous_line is None
            or self.previous_line.is_decorator
        ):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I've adjusted the logic related to decorators and the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the current line. This should address the issue identified in the failing test and produce the correct output.
