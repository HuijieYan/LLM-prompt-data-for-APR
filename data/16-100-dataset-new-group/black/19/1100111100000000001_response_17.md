The potential error in the code is that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is trying to access properties and methods of `current_line`, `self`, and `self.previous_line` without checking if they exist or are initialized. This could lead to AttributeError or NoneType errors. The bug is likely causing unexpected behavior in the logic and returning incorrect values.

To fix the bug, we need to check if these attributes and methods exist before accessing them. We also need to handle the scenarios when they are not initialized or do not exist.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if hasattr(current_line, 'depth') and current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if hasattr(current_line, 'leaves') and current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if hasattr(self, 'previous_defs'):
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = getattr(current_line, 'is_decorator', False)
    is_def = getattr(current_line, 'is_def', False)
    is_class = getattr(current_line, 'is_class', False)
    is_flow_control = getattr(current_line, 'is_flow_control', False)
    is_import = getattr(current_line, 'is_import', False)
    is_yield = getattr(current_line, 'is_yield', False)
    
    if (is_decorator or is_def or is_class):
        if not is_decorator:
            if hasattr(self, 'previous_defs'):
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if hasattr(self, 'previous_line') and self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if hasattr(self, 'previous_line') and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    if is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        hasattr(self, 'previous_line')
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        hasattr(self, 'previous_line')
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have added checks using `hasattr` before accessing attributes and methods of `current_line`, `self`, and `self.previous_line`. We also used `getattr` to safely access the properties of `current_line` without raising AttributeError.

This should address the potential bug and ensure that the function safely accesses the necessary attributes and methods.
