The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The logic to handle the `before` variable within the `while` loop.
2. The conditions for inserting empty lines based on the current line's attributes.
3. The conditions for returning the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The cause of the bug is that the `before` variable is being overwritten within the `while` loop, which affects the computation of the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. Additionally, the conditions for inserting empty lines and returning the number of empty lines are not accurately capturing the intended behavior.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the logic for handling the `before` variable within the `while` loop to ensure it does not get overwritten. Then, review and update the conditions for inserting empty lines and returning the number of empty lines based on the intended behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        before = 0
        
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        newlines_before = 0
        newlines_after = 0
        
        if self.previous_line:
            is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
            if depth > self.previous_line.depth:
                newlines_before = 1
            elif is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
                if not is_decorator:
                    self.previous_defs.append(depth)
                if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                    newlines_before = 0
                else:
                    newlines_before = 2
                if current_line.depth:
                    newlines_before -= 1
            elif current_line.is_flow_control:
                newlines_before = before
                newlines_after = 1
            elif (
                self.previous_line.is_import
                and not current_line.is_import
                and depth == self.previous_line.depth
            ):
                newlines_before = before or 1
            elif (
                self.previous_line.is_yield
                and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
            ):
                newlines_before = before or 1

        return newlines_before, newlines_after
```

With the corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test.
