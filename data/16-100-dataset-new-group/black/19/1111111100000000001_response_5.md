The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and takes a `Line` object as input, which is used to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. Improper handling of conditional statements, which might be causing incorrect values to be returned.
2. Inconsistencies with the usage of class attributes such as `previous_defs`, `previous_line`, and methods such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` from functions within the same file. There could be issues with how these class attributes and methods are being used within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect conditional checks and improper usage of class attributes and methods, which may lead to incorrect computation of the number of potential extra empty lines needed.

A suggestion for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the conditional statements and usage of class attributes and methods are consistent and accurate, which could involve reviewing the logic of the conditional checks and how the class attributes and methods are being accessed within the function. Also, it would be good to handle the edge cases based on the conditions being evaluated and provide appropriate return values accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
            not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for conditional checks has been updated to handle the edge cases based on the conditions being evaluated. The conditions for updating the values of `max_allowed`, `before`, and handling various class attributes and methods have been revised to ensure consistent and accurate behavior.
