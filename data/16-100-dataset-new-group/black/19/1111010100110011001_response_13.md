The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` exhibits the following issues:
1. Accessing attributes or methods that are not defined within the class `EmptyLineTracker`.
2. Incorrect handling of the `is_decorator` check and its usage in if conditions.
3. Modifying the `prefix` attribute of `first_leaf`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
4. Inconsistent return values and logic to calculate `newlines`.
5. Inconsistent handling of reducing `before` value in conditions related to `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`.

To correct these issues, we need to refactor the logic inside `_maybe_empty_lines` to properly handle the optional newlines and decide on the correct number of lines to insert before and after the currently processed line.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
    else:
        before = 0
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the unnecessary block of code and fixed the return values to match the expected output based on the input parameters and logic.

This corrected version should address the issues and pass the failing test cases.
