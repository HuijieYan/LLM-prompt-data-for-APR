The bug in the function arises from incorrect logic based on the current line's properties and variables from the class. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` has issues with conditional logic, variable assignments, and incorrect comparison of current line properties. The bug manifests in the wrong calculation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

To fix the bug, we need to address the incorrect use of properties and variables, ensure that the correct conditions are checked, and the expected values are assigned to the relevant variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

        if depth:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the previously failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
