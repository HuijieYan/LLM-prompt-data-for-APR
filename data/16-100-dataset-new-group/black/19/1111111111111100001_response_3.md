The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely caused by the incorrect assignment of the `newlines` variable when the current line is not a decorator, def, or class. The function assigns `newlines` to 2 if `current_line.depth` is non-zero, but does not account for cases with a zero depth. The repeated assignment of `before` value in the function's body also seems unnecessary. Additionally, the condition `(before or 1)` is incorrect and should be revised to properly evaluate the logic.

Based on a review of the bug and runtime values, the suggested strategy includes:
1. Check the flow of conditions to ensure proper handling of indentation levels.
2. Review the handling of decorators, defs, flow control, and imports to ensure correct newline handling based on the line type.
  
Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1
    
    before = min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed) if current_line.leaves else 0
    current_is_decorator_or_def = current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class

    if current_is_decorator_or_def:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments to handle the logic for indentation levels and different line types within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the corrected version should pass the failing tests.
