The issue with the provided _maybe_empty_lines function seems to be related to the manipulation of the "before" and "newlines" variables. The logic for updating these variables inside if-else conditions seems to be incorrect, resulting in unexpected outputs.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that the "before" and "newlines" variables are updated correctly based on the conditions specified in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0] if current_line.leaves else None
    before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if first_leaf else 0

    if current_line.depth:
        newlines = 1
    else:
        newlines = 2

    if not current_line.is_decorator and (current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class):
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line:
            return newlines, 0
        else:
            return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values provided. It updates the "max_allowed", "first_leaf", "before", and "newlines" variables based on the specified conditions and should provide the expected values and types for the given test cases.
