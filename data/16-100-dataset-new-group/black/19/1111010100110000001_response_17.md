1. The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The potential error locations within the function include the handling of `self.previous_defs`, the conditional statements for inserting empty lines, and the logic for returning the number of empty lines.
3. The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect logic in the conditional statements and the handling of the `self.previous_defs` list. This results in an incorrect number of empty lines being returned by the function, leading to a failing test.
4. To fix the bug, the logic for handling `self.previous_defs` and the conditional statements for inserting empty lines need to be carefully reviewed. Additionally, the logic for returning the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line should be revised.
5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    before = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth < len(self.previous_defs):
        self.previous_defs = self.previous_defs[:depth]
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        return 0, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```
After making these corrections, the function should return the correct number of empty lines according to the provided logic and should pass the failing test.
