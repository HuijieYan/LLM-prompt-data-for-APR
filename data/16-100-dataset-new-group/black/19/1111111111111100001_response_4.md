The problem with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it does not correctly determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line in the code. It has several conditional branches, but due to the use of `return` statements within them, it may not execute all the necessary checks and calculations, leading to incorrect results.

The identified potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The conditional check for decorators, definitions, classes, and flow control, where the `return` statement might prematurely exit the function before all necessary checks are performed.
2. The calculations related to `before` and `newlines` variables are not consistently updated and may lead to incorrect empty line counts.

To fix the bug, ensure that all conditional branches are evaluated and that necessary updates to `before` and `newlines` occur consistently across all paths.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if not is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these changes, the function should handle the cases more accurately and consistently, leading to a corrected behavior in the failing tests.
