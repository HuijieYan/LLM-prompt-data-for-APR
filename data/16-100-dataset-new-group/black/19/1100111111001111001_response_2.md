The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the conditions and variable assignments. Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the cause of the bug appears to be related to the conditional checks and variable assignments.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:

1. The first step is to check the conditionals and ensure they are evaluating correctly.
2. Check the variable assignments and verify that the correct values are being assigned to the variables where needed.
3. Utilize the available variable values and types at the time of the return to ensure that the expected values and types align with the current results.

Here is the corrected version of the function that takes into account the expected input/output values:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = getattr(current_line, "is_decorator", False)
    is_def = getattr(current_line, "is_def", False)
    is_class = getattr(current_line, "is_class", False)
    is_flow_control = getattr(current_line, "is_flow_control", False)
    is_import = getattr(current_line, "is_import", False)
    is_yield = getattr(current_line, "is_yield", False)
    
    if any([is_decorator, is_def, is_class]):
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, we have updated `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` by using `getattr` in case the attribute doesn't exist. Now the function should satisfy the expected input/output values for all cases.
