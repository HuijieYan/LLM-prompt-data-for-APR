The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that is causing an error when running the `test_comment_in_decorator` test. The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output when using the `assertFormatEqual` method.

The potential error locations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method are the conditions for returning the number of newlines and the before value. There could be an issue with the logic of the if-else conditions which is leading to incorrect calculation of newlines and before values.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the logic of handling newlines and indentation levels when certain line types are encountered (e.g., decorators, imports, flow control, etc.). It seems that the logic for handling these cases is leading to incorrect results, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling newlines, before values, and special line types should be carefully reviewed and possibly refactored. It's important to ensure that the conditions and calculations for newlines and before values align with the expected behavior as per the requirements.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditions and calculations for handling newlines and before values are adjusted to ensure correct behavior based on the requirements of the `_maybe_empty_lines` method. After making these changes, the method should pass the failing test.
