The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be part of the class `EmptyLineTracker`. This function is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. 

The potential error locations within the `buggy function` are:
1. The updates to `before` and `newlines` variables might not be capturing the correct number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The conditions used to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line might not be correctly implemented.

Based on the error message from the failing test, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, causing a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic used to determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line and ensure that it correctly captures the required number of empty lines based on the conditions provided in the code.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line has been updated based on the conditions provided in the code. This should ensure that the function correctly determines the number of empty lines needed, resolving the bug and making the function pass the failing test.
