The potential error locations in the buggy function are as follows:
1. In the while loop, the previous_defs list is being popped while being used in the loop condition.
2. 'self' is used as a parameter to determine the type of the current line.
3. The logic for calculating the newlines is complex and might not be working as expected.

The cause of the bug could be the incorrect usage of the previous_defs list, which leads to an unexpected behavior. Additionally, the usage of 'self' as a parameter for determining the type of the current line might not be working correctly.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Fix the while loop to avoid removing elements from current list while using it in loop condition.
2. Use a different parameter or an attribute from the class to determine the type of the current line.
3. Update the logic for calculating newlines based on the requirements and constraints.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    previous_defs_copy = self.previous_defs[:]
    while previous_defs_copy and previous_defs_copy[-1] >= depth:
        previous_defs_copy.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    current_line_type = get_line_type(current_line)  # Assuming a new function get_line_type is created based on Line properties
    if current_line_type in {"decorator", "def", "class"}:
        if current_line_type != "decorator":
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and get_line_type(self.previous_line) == "decorator":
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and get_line_type(self.previous_line) == "import"
        and current_line_type != "import"
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and get_line_type(self.previous_line) == "yield"
        and (current_line_type != "yield" or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, I've made the following changes:
1. Used a copy of `self.previous_defs` in the while loop to avoid modifying the original list while iterating.
2. Added a hypothetical function `get_line_type` to determine the type of the current line based on the properties of `Line`.
3. Made minor adjustments to the conditional statements to use the new `current_line_type` variable for readability.
