## Corrections 

The potential cause of the bug is that the function `maybe_empty_lines` processes the `before` value more than once without resetting it for each condition. Each time `before` is computed, it accumulates changes for a specific case, but at the end, the function returns `before` without resetting it. This can lead to incorrect `before` values being used outside their intended scope. 

To fix this bug, we need to reset the `before` variable after it's used in each condition, and then use the updated value of `before` for the next calculations. 

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    # ... rest of the code ...

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0  # Reset before to 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # ... rest of the code ...
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2  # Reset before to 1 or 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    # ... rest of the code ...
```
