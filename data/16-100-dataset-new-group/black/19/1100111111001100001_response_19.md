The bug in the `MaybeEmptyLines` function is due to incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines based on the current line and the previous line's attributes. This results in the function not correctly determining the number of empty lines needed between the current and previous lines, causing test failures. 

To fix the bug, the following steps are suggested:
1. Re-evaluate the logic for determining the number of empty lines and ensure that it considers the various attributes and conditions of the current and previous lines correctly.
2. Update the handling of different line types (decorators, imports, yield, etc.) to appropriately calculate the number of empty lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `MaybeEmptyLines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
The corrected version of the function addresses the issues with determining the number of empty lines based on the attributes and conditions of the current and previous lines. This should resolve the failing tests and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
