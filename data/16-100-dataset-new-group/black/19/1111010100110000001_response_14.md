The potential issue with the buggy function lies in the logic that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line. It seems that the function is not handling the different cases correctly and is not returning the expected output.

The error message from the failing test provides a comparison between the expected output and the actual output. It seems that the actual output is not matching the expected output, which indicates that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not calculating the empty lines correctly.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensuring that it correctly handles different cases based on the type and depth of the current line, as well as the previous line.

Here's the fixed and corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if not current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

These changes address potential issues and incorrect handling of some cases, ensuring that the function correctly calculates the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
