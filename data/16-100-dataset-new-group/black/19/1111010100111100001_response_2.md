I will start by analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class in order to identify the potential error locations and understand the cause of the bug.

### Analysis:
The `EmptyLineTracker` class is a data class that provides a stateful method `_maybe_empty_lines` which returns the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function receives a `Line` object as input and processes its attributes to determine the number of empty lines. The input includes information about the depth of the line, the line's content, and details about the previous line.

The function uses a set of conditions to make different decisions based on the type and content of the input line as well as the previous line processed.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrectly updating the `before` variable inside a `while` loop.
2. Details related to handling of `current_line` and `previous_line`.

### Cause of the Bug:
Based on the runtime values and types of input parameters and variables, it appears that the `before` value is not being updated correctly inside the `while` loop. This could be leading to incorrect computations and resulting in potential wrong counts for empty lines before and after the current line.

In addition, the checks related to `current_line` and `previous_line` handling could be causing incorrect decisions and counts for empty lines.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Verify and update the logic for updating the `before` variable inside the `while` loop to ensure it behaves as expected.
2. Review the conditions related to `current_line` and `previous_line` handling to make sure they are correctly capturing the scenario's requirements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    index = -1
    while len(self.previous_defs) > 0 and self.previous_defs[index] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        index -= 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for updating the `before` variable inside the `while` loop has been revised, and the conditions related to `current_line` and `previous_line` handling have been reviewed to ensure they correctly capture the requirements. These changes are aimed at fixing the bug and ensuring that the function provides accurate counts for potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
