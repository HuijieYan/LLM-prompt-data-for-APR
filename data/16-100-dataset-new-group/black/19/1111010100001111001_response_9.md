The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely due to the conditions which are not correctly setting the `newlines` value. Additionally, the condition for setting `before` to 2 after popping `previous_defs` is also not functioning as intended. The code needs to be refactored to ensure that the correct conditions are being met and that the newlines are being calculated properly.

Based on the analysis, I suggest fixing the bug by modifying the conditions and calculations for setting `newlines` and `before` values.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        before = 1
        return before, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        before = 1
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the unnecessary conditions and combined the conditions where possible to make the logic more concise. The calculations for `newlines` and `before` have also been updated based on the expected input and output values. This should ensure that the function now returns the correct results for the given test cases.
