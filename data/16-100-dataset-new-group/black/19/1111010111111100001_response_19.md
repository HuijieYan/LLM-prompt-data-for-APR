The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the incorrect handling of empty lines and newlines before and after the lines to be processed. The bug primarily relates to the way it calculates and applies the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

The issue seems to result from the incorrect computation of the `before` variable and the use of `before = 1 if depth else 2` while processing the first leaf, leading to an incorrect return of the value for additional empty lines before and after the line. Additionally, handling related to decorators, imports, and yields seems to be incorrectly calculated.

A potential strategy to fix the bug is to accurately calculate the number of empty lines before and after the current line, considering various conditions like the presence of decorators, imports, and yields.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if not current_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_class and not current_line.is_def:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = min(1 if current_line.depth else 2, max_allowed)

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Please replace the existing `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the corrected version. After doing this, the failing test should pass.
