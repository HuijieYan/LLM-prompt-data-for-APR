The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be causing incorrect output for different input cases than expected. The issue lies within the handling of `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` fields, as well as the updates to the `previous_defs` variable.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the different conditions for returning the `newlines` and `before` values based on the `current_line` attributes. Additionally, the updates to the `previous_defs` field need to be managed properly to ensure correct tracking of depth levels.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that the correct conditions are being checked and handled to return the expected values for `newlines` and `before` based on the attributes of `current_line`. Additionally, the handling of updates to the `previous_defs` list has been corrected to track depth levels properly. This version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
