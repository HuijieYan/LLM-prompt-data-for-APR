The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines` defined in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This function is used to compute the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The function's bug seems to be occurring in the mechanism for determining the number of extra newlines before and after each line. The cases where the newlines need to be inserted or not are not properly handled, leading to incorrect computation of the number of newlines to be added.

The bug occurs when the function attempts to compute the number of newlines before and after the currently processed line. It incorrectly assigns a value to `max_allowed` based on `current_line.depth` and combines it with other conditions to arrive at the number of newlines, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to reimplement the logic for determining the number of newlines. A more structured approach to handling the different cases and their respective conditions would help in computing the correct number of newlines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Initialize number of extra newlines before and after the currently processed line
    before = 0
    after = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.depth == 0:  # First line in the file
            return before, after
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return before, after
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return before, after

        # 2 newlines before and 0 newline after non-zero depth lines
        after = 0 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        before = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return before, after

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        # 0 newline before, 1 newline after flow control lines
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        # Add 1 newline before if it's not an import line preceded by an import line with the same depth
        before = 1
        return before, after

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        # Similar handling for yield lines
        before = 1
        return before, after

    # No specific condition met - use default before and after values
    return before, after
```

This corrected version of the function reintroduces the necessary conditions to correctly compute the number of newlines based on the current line's attributes and the previous line's attributes. It provides tailored logic for different cases to ensure the correct behavior.

By applying this fix, the function should now compute the correct number of newlines for each case, resolving the observed bug.
