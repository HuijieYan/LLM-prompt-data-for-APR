The buggy function contains multiple conditional blocks and potential error locations, such as reassigning `before` within a loop, and handling different conditions using separate `if` statements, which may not accurately evaluate all cases.

The failing test calls the `assertFormatEqual` method and compares the expected and actual values, but they don't match. The expected output represents the formatted source code with added empty lines and the actual output is the source code after being passed through the buggy function. The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of empty lines based on various conditions and incorrect logic of the function.

To fix the bug, I would suggest refactoring the function to ensure that all conditions are evaluated correctly, and the number of empty lines is being correctly determined based on the specific requirements for each condition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_empty_lines = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_empty_lines = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_empty_lines)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This function accounts for all the potential error points and ensures that the correct number of empty lines is added based on the specific conditions and expected output for each case.
