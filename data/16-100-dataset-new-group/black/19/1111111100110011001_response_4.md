The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the variable `is_decorator` is being checked for a previous value (and acted upon) before assigning a new value, causing incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `is_decorator` variable is assigned a value before it is checked for a previous value later in the function. We can do this by creating a new variable to handle the previous value of `is_decorator` before reassigning `is_decorator`, preventing the previously assigned (and possibly false) value from being used later in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        is_decorator_prev = self._is_decorator
        self._is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if is_decorator_prev or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator_prev:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, a new variable `is_decorator_prev` is introduced to store the previous value of `is_decorator`, and it is used to correctly handle the behavior in the function before `is_decorator` is reassigned. This ensures that the function will work correctly and should resolve the issue with the failing test.
