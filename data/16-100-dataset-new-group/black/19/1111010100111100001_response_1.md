The bug appears to be in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function seems to be designed to track and return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The error message from the failing test indicates that the number of empty lines is not being handled correctly.

Upon inspecting the function, it is clear that some conditional checks are modifying the `before` variable without consideration for the subsequent checks. This results in incorrect values being returned and consequently, failing the tests.

Additionally, the prior default value of `before` is overridden by certain checks unconditionally, leading to incorrect counts of potential empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The strategy is to refactor the conditional checks and ensure that the `before` variable is updated in a way that propagates through the appropriate conditions to accurately count the potential empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if not is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditional checks have been rearranged to update the `before` variable appropriately, ensuring that the correct number of potential empty lines is returned. With this modification, the function should now pass the failing test.
