To fix the buggy function, let's start by analyzing the issues in the function and identifying potential error locations.

The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes two parameters, `self` and `current_line`. It is expected to return a tuple of two integers. The function uses several other methods and functions to compute and modify variables before returning the tuple.

The buggy function has two potential error locations:
1. The `if current_line.leaves` block calculates the `before` value based on the `prefix` field of the `first_leaf`. The behavior of this block can lead to incorrect results.
2. The conditional blocks that check for `is_decorator`, `is_import`, `is_flow_control`, `is_yield` conditions are not properly handling the before and newlines values that need to be returned.

The failing test demonstrates that the actual result of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function does not match the expected value. This is indicated by the raised AssertionError in the failing test.

Since the current implementation fails to return the expected values, we need to update the logic to correctly calculate the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` values based on the conditions, and finally return the correct tuple result.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_def = current_line.is_def
    is_class = current_line.is_class
    is_flow_control = current_line.is_flow_control
    is_import = current_line.is_import
    is_yield = current_line.is_yield
    
    if is_decorator or is_def or is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = max(2 - current_line.depth, 0)

    elif is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function includes changes in conditional logic to compute `before` and `newlines` correctly based on different conditions. This should address the issues and help the function produce the expected values.
