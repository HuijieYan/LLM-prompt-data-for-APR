The bug occurs when the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is called and executes the logic for determining whether to insert empty lines in the output. The function takes in a `current_line` object and returns a tuple of two integers. The function uses various conditions and variables to determine the appropriate values for the return tuple.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. The calculation of `newlines` is based on multiple conditional checks, which may not always produce the correct output.
2. The logic for handling import and yield statements may have issues when determining the number of newlines to insert.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not consistently and accurately determining the number of newlines to insert based on the input `current_line` and other contextual factors. This is leading to incorrect output that fails the test assertions.

To fix the bug, I suggest revisiting the conditional checks in the function and ensuring that they are accurately capturing the conditions for inserting newlines based on different types of lines, such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Assuming all existing imports are available

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This updated version of the function should address the issues and produce correct output for the given test cases.
