The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is causing the failing test due to incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines to insert before a line of code. The function is not handling the insertion of empty lines correctly between decorators and within certain code blocks.

The issue arises due to incorrect logic when checking for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields, resulting in incorrect insertion of empty lines.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before a line of code based on the code context.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields has been updated to correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before a line of code.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
