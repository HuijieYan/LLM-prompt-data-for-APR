The bug is likely due to the fact that `is_import` and `is_yield` are called incorrectly within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The implementation of the class `EmptyLineTracker` doesn't include these functions, but they are defined as separate functions. This might be the cause of the bug in the function. The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `assertFormatEqual` function, suggesting that the empty lines are not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, the correct functions `is_import` and `is_yield` should be called within the `EmptyLineTracker` class definition. This can be done by moving the definitions of these functions within the class definition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def is_import(self, leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
        # Implementation of the is_import function

    def is_yield(self) -> bool:
        # Implementation of the is_yield function

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # Corrected implementation of the buggy function
        # ... (rest of the code)
```

By moving the definitions of `is_import` and `is_yield` functions into the `EmptyLineTracker` class, the correct functions will be called and the bug should be fixed. This should address the issue with the failing test.
