The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing an incorrect number of empty lines to be added before and after the currently processed line. This results in a failed test for formatting the code.

The potential errors in the function are:
1. Incorrect manipulation of `before` and `depth` variables.
2. Incorrect usage of `self.previous_defs`, `self.previous_line`, and `current_line` attributes.
3. Incorrect logic for determining the number of empty lines based on the characteristics of the current line.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted code, resulting in the assertion error during the test.

To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be updated to correctly compute the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the rules defined in the comments and the logic provided by the function.

Updated and corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    before = 0
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```
After applying the above fixes, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should pass the failing test for formatting the code.
