The bug in the function is evident from the failing test cases where it doesn't produce the expected output. A critical point to be fixed is the calculation of the `newlines` variable based on the conditions. The code should be updated to correctly calculate the values for `newlines` and `before` based on the given conditions.

The main issue seems to arise from the calculation of `before` and `newlines` variables in the function. It seems like the conditions are not correctly designed to handle the different scenarios, which is resulting in incorrect output. The function should be updated to consider all possible scenarios and calculate the variables as per the expected behavior.

Given the provided details, the function can be fixed by updating the conditions and redefining the logic to correctly calculate the values for `newlines` and `before` based on various scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions for calculating `newlines` and `before` have been redefined to handle all the cases correctly.

This updated function should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
