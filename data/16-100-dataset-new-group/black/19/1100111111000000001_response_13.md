The buggy function `maybe_empty_lines` seems to be suffering from potential issues related to the logic and the use of class attributes and method calls. The function is meant to return a tuple containing the number of empty lines to be added before the current line and whether a blank line should be added at the current line.

Here are the identified issues:
1. Inconsistent use of `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class`. The function calls `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, and `current_line.is_class` but it's unclear how these attributes are defined or initialized.
2. Usage of class attributes without the `self` prefix. It seems that the function is trying to access class attributes directly without the `self` prefix. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
3. Improper handling of previous line attributes. The function references `self.previous_line` without properly handling cases where `self.previous_line` may be None.
4. Unclear usage of `self.previous_defs` and `depth`. It's unclear how `self.previous_defs` is initialized or modified, and how it relates to the `depth` attribute.
5. The logic and conditions within the function are complex and intertwined, making it difficult to follow and reason about.

To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be refactored to ensure proper usage and handling of class attributes, previous line attributes, and improved readability of the logic.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Logic for handling previous definitions
    if self.previous_defs and depth <= self.previous_defs[-1]:
        while self.previous_defs and depth <= self.previous_defs[-1]:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth > 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (
            self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        ):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
        and not current_line.is_import(self)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
        and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version:
- Proper usage of class attributes with `self` prefix has been ensured.
- The conditions and logics within the function have been refactored for improved readability and to address the issues identified.
- The handling of `self.previous_defs` and `depth` has been reviewed for improved correctness and clarity.
- Handling of `self.previous_line` has been modified to avoid NoneType related errors.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
