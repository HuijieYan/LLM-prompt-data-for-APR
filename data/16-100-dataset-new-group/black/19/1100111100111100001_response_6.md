The bug in the provided code is that the logic for setting the `before` variable isn't working correctly. In the first `if` block in the function where `current_line.depth` is checked, the `max_allowed` variable is being set to 2, but this value is not being used effectively to set the `before` variable in the subsequent code.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to use the `max_allowed` variable to ensure that the `before` variable does not exceed this value. Additionally, the conditionals for setting the value of `before` need to be modified to cover all the conditions properly.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Initialize before to 0
    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        
        # Update before based on depth
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator    
    if not is_decorator and (current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class):
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This fix should address the issues seen in the failing test cases and ensure that the correct number of newlines are inserted as expected.
