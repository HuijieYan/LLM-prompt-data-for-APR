## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is used to calculate the number of empty lines that should be inserted before a given line in a Python file. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the formatting of the code, specifically the number of empty lines between certain elements.

## Bugs:
1. The function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines before and after certain elements, leading to incorrect formatting.

## Bug locations:
1. Unclear flow control logic and incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines to insert.
2. Incorrect handling of different types of lines (import, yield, flow control, etc.).

## Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of various scenarios for inserting empty lines in Python code. This leads to incorrect formatting and failing test cases.

## Strategy to fix the bug:
1. Review the logic for handling different types of lines and insertions of empty lines.
2. Ensure that the logic for adding empty lines is correct for each scenario, such as imports, yield statements, flow control, etc.
3. Test the function with various scenarios to ensure correct formatting.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, handling of different scenarios is reviewed and fixed, and the logic for adding empty lines is corrected to ensure proper formatting.
