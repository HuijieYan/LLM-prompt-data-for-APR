The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several related functions that it calls, such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_yield`, and `is_import`, as well as the `append` function. The function seems to be designed to return the number of empty lines to be added before the current line along with a flag indicating if a new line is to be added after the current line. However, it has an issue with handling the logic for empty lines and new lines, causing it to fail in certain test cases.

The potential error locations in the function include:
1. The logic for handling the number of empty lines before the current line is not always consistent based on the conditions and the previous line's attributes.
2. The handling of the new line after the current line also depends on various conditions and attributes of the current and previous lines.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the scenarios for adding empty lines before and after the current line. The logic is overly complex, making it difficult to determine the correct number of lines to add before and after the current line based on the various conditions and attributes of the lines.

To fix the bug, a strategy could involve simplifying the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line. It may involve revisiting the conditions and attributes of the current and previous lines to ensure that the correct number of empty lines and new lines are added based on the context of each line.

Below is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    
    before = 0
    if self.previous_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    elif self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth:
        before = 1
    
    if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator or \
       self.previous_line.is_def or current_line.is_def or \
       self.previous_line.is_class or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or self.previous_line.depth != current_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line by re-evaluating the conditions and attributes of the lines to make the decision clearer. This version should pass the failing test mentioned above.
