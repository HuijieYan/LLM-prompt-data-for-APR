The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it does not properly handle the calculation of empty lines before and after a line in various conditions. There are multiple return statements with inconsistent return types, and the logic for calculating the number of empty lines is unclear. It does not account for all of the different possible scenarios that can occur during its execution.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to completely rewrite the `maybe_empty_lines` function. The function should include a clear and consistent algorithm for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the conditions and properties of the input `current_line` and the `previous_line`. This algorithm should consider edge cases and specifically cater to different scenarios that may occur.

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    prev_empty_lines = 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.depth >= current_line.depth:
        prev_empty_lines = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return max_allowed - prev_empty_lines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max_allowed, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return max_allowed, 0

    return max_allowed - prev_empty_lines, 0
```

This corrected function includes logic to properly handle the computation of the number of empty lines before and after the current line, based on its properties and the previous line's properties. This function should now be able to pass the failing test cases and satisfy expected input/output values.
