The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect indentation for the code within the if-else blocks.
2. Undefined variable `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line`.
3. Inconsistent use of `depth` and `current_line.depth`.
4. Misuse of `current_line.depth` for the 'depth' variable.

The cause of the bug is that the logic inside the function is not correctly handling the conditions and variables, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == current_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != current_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the issues of incorrect indentation and usage of `depth` and `current_line.depth` have been fixed. Additionally, the undefined variables `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line` have been assumed to be defined elsewhere in the class.
