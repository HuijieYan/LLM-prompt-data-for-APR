The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be fixed to return the correct values for the specified test cases.

The potential errors in the function are:
1. The handling of `before` and `newlines` variables may not be correct for all conditions.
2. The conditional statements and their branching need to be reviewed to ensure that the function covers all possible cases.

The cause of the bug:
The bug could be due to incorrect handling of the `before`, `newlines`, and `max_allowed` variables in the function. Additionally, the conditional statements might not cover all the cases properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review and update the conditional statements to cover all possible cases for different types of lines and leaves.
2. Ensure that the `before` and `newlines` variables are set correctly based on the conditions.
3. Modify the function to return the expected values for the provided test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    elif current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the specified failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
