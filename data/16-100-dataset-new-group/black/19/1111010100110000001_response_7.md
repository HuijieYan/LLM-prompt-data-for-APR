The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. Looking at the error message, it seems that there are issues with the number of empty lines being returned by this function.

After analyzing the function, it seems there are certain conditions where the logic for calculating extra empty lines is not correct. The while loop that pops elements from `self.previous_defs` and assigns the `before` value is causing the issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `before` value is being overwritten in the while loop inside the function, which leads to incorrect computation of the number of extra empty lines.

To fix this bug, the while loop should be modified to use a separate variable to store the number of empty lines, and then that value should be returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        extra_before = before  # Store the original before value
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            extra_before = 1 if depth else 2  # Update the extra_before value
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return extra_before, 1  # Return the original before value

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (extra_before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (extra_before or 1), 0

        return extra_before, 0  # Return the original before value
```

By using a separate variable to store the original `before` value, the function should now correctly calculate the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
