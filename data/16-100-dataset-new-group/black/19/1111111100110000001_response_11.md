It seems that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not properly handling the empty lines in the current line, as indicated by the difference between the expected and actual results in the error message. The function is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed both before and after the currently processed line, based on certain conditions. 

After analyzing the function and its calls to related functions, I have identified a potential faulty logic where the function should be resetting `before` to 0 after consuming the first leaf's extra newlines. Additionally, the condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator` is not being properly handled, possibly leading to incorrect calculations for empty lines.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not resetting the `before` variable when consuming the first leaf's extra newlines, and the condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator` is not being handled properly and is likely contributing to the incorrect number of empty lines in the output.

To fix the bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be modified to properly reset `before` to 0 after consuming the first leaf's extra newlines, and the condition checking for `is_decorator` should be properly handled to avoid incorrect calculations for empty lines. Additionally, the function may need more detailed handling of different scenarios to ensure accurate results.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        before = 0  # Reset before to 0 after consuming the newlines
    else:
        before = 0
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```
By resetting the `before` variable to 0 after consuming the newlines, we ensure that the correct number of empty lines is calculated. Additionally, the function should properly handle the conditions related to decorators to avoid any incorrect calculations.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
