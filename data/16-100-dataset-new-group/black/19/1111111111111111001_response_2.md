The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it doesn't handle possible cases where lines can have multiple decorators or imports. The function needs to keep track of the different combinations of decorators and imports in order to insert the correct number of new lines.

The corrected function will need to account for these cases by storing information about previous lines and checking for conditions where new lines should be inserted. More specifically, the function should keep track of the type of the previous line and the current line, and insert new lines based on the conditions for decorator, import, and yield.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if (
        is_decorator
        or current_line.is_def
        or current_line.is_class
    ):
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    else:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
    if (
        current_line.is_flow_control
        and self.previous_line
        and not self.previous_line.is_import
    ):
        return 0, 1

    if (
        current_line.is_import
        and self.previous_line
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0
    elif (
        current_line.is_yield
        and self.previous_line
        and depth != self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0
    return 0, 0
```

In this corrected version, we have added more specific checks for handling cases involving decorators, imports, and yields. These checks are designed to ensure the correct number of new lines is inserted based on the conditions provided.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
