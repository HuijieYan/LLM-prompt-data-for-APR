## Fixing the bug

The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the logic for handling the insertion of empty lines before specific code elements. Based on the failing test and the runtime values, the current implementation is not correctly determining the number of newlines to insert.

The causes of the bug appear to be related to the handling of `self.previous_defs` and the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert.

### Observations:
1. The `self.previous_defs` list is used to keep track of the depth of previous definitions but is not being updated correctly.
2. The logic for determining the number of newlines to insert based on the current line and the previous line is not correctly considering all relevant conditions.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the handling of `self.previous_defs` to correctly track the depth of previous definitions that affect the insertion of empty lines.
2. Review and correct the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted based on specific conditions related to the current line and the previous line.

### Corresponding fixes in the function:
1. **Fix the handling of `self.previous_defs`:** Ensure that the `self.previous_defs` list is updated appropriately based on the depth of the current line and inserted/removed based on the condition.
2. **Review and fix the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert:** Carefully review the conditions and expected behavior for empty line insertion based on different types of lines and their relationships with previous lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(bool(current_line.depth))
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function includes the updates to handle the `self.previous_defs` list and to review and fix the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
