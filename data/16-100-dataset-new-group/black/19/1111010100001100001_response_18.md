The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` contains several potential sources of issues. There are conditions that return a value before executing other conditional branches, incorrect comparisons and assignments of `before` and `newlines` variables, and potential logic errors when checking if a line is a decorator or part of a flow control.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic of the function and determine the correct expected behavior based on the input parameters and the purpose of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This may involve reordering conditional branches, correcting comparisons, ensuring the correct assignment of variables, and validating the behavior of each conditional branch.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        if not current_line.depth:
            return newlines, 0
        else:
            return newlines - 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    max_allowed_empty_lines = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed_empty_lines = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed_empty_lines)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic has been restructured to ensure that each conditional branch handles the correct scenarios and that proper calculations and comparisons take place. The `max_allowed` variable is initialized based on the depth of the current line, and the `before` value is correctly calculated and updated based on the presence of leaves. The handling of `decorators` and `flow_control`, as well as `imports` and `yield`, has also been corrected. The function now returns the correct values based on the logic and input parameters.
