To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address the potential issue of how the `max_allowed` variable is being reassigned multiple times within the function. It seems that the second reassignment of `max_allowed` is incorrect and may cause unwanted behavior.

Based on the failing test and the expected input/output values, we can suggest a strategy for fixing the bug by simplifying the logic in the function and ensuring that the `max_allowed` value is correctly determined based on the conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1  # Set max_allowed to the default value
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2  # Update max_allowed if depth is 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Rest of the logic remains the same...

    return before, 0  # Returning the calculated values
```

In the corrected version, we make sure that `max_allowed` is initially set to 1, then it is updated to 2 only if the `current_line.depth` is 0. This should address the potential issue of incorrect reassignment of `max_allowed` and provide the expected results for the failing test and the expected input/output values.
