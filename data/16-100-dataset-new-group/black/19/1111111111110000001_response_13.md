The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from a logical error in the conditional statements that handle different cases. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the situations where previous line attributes are used to determine the number of newlines to be inserted.

The cause of the bug is likely in the conditional statements that check for attributes of the current and previous lines. The error message from the failing test shows a mismatch between the expected and actual output, indicating that the function is not producing the correct number of empty lines in the output.

To fix the bug, we should carefully review the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that the conditional statements accurately determine the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the attributes of the current and previous lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I have made the following changes:
- Replaced `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(current_line)` and `is_import(self.previous_line)` respectively to correct the function calls.
- Updated the logic in the conditional statements to accurately handle the cases for different line attributes based on existing methods.
  
This corrected version should eliminate the logical errors and pass the failing test.
