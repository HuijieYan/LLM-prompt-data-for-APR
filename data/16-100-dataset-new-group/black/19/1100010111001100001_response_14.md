Looking at the code of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it appears that the issue may be related to the logic of setting the `before` variable. In some cases, it should be set to 1 when `depth` is not zero, and to 2 when `depth` is zero. However, there seem to be inconsistencies in different sections of the code when `before` is determined.

The function has multiple conditional statements that may need to be rationalized. It may also be beneficial to re-evaluate the condition for setting `before` and to ensure that the subsequent logic aligns with it.

Additionally, the strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing each conditional block and explicitly setting the `before` value where necessary. It may require restructuring some conditional statements to ensure that the correct `before` value is assigned based on different scenarios.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By re-evaluating and restructuring the conditional blocks and the assignments of the `before` variable, the corrected version ensures that the logic corresponds to the intended behavior.
