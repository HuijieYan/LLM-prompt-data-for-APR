The root cause of the bug is due to conflicts with variable names between the buggy function and other functions. There are several this. This can lead to incorrect assignments and comparisons. Additionally, the logic in the code is quite complex and handling of conditions is not properly managed, leading to incorrect outputs for different input combinations.

A strategy to fix the bug is to rename the functions and variables within the buggy function to avoid conflicts with other functions. Additionally, simplify the logic of the function and handle conditions more explicitly to achieve the correct results.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed_lines = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed_lines = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        prefix_newlines = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before_newlines = min(prefix_newlines, max_allowed_lines)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before_newlines = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.prev_defs and self.prev_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.prev_defs.pop()
        before_newlines = 1 if depth else 2

    is_current_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_current_def = current_line.is_def
    is_current_class = current_line.is_class
    is_current_flow_control = current_line.is_flow_control
    is_current_import = current_line.is_import
    is_current_yield = current_line.is_yield

    if is_current_decorator or is_current_def or is_current_class:
        if not is_current_decorator:
            self.prev_defs.append(depth)
        if self.prev_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.prev_line and self.prev_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines_to_insert = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines_to_insert -= 1
        return newlines_to_insert, 0

    if is_current_flow_control:
        return before_newlines, 1

    if (
        self.prev_line
        and self.prev_line.is_import
        and not is_current_import
        and depth == self.prev_line.depth
    ):
        return (before_newlines or 1), 0

    if (
        self.prev_line
        and self.prev_line.is_yield
        and (not is_current_yield or depth != self.prev_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before_newlines or 1), 0

    return before_newlines, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function, the function and variable names were updated to avoid conflicts. The logic is simplified and the conditions are handled more explicitly to achieve correct behavior for different input combinations.
