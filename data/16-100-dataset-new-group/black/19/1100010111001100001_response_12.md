The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the `before` variable not being updated correctly within the while loop. This is causing the returned value to be incorrect in certain cases. The while loop is supposed to pop elements from `self.previous_defs` based on a condition, and then update the `before` variable. However, the `before` variable seems to always be assigned the value `1` or `2` within the loop, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should update the `before` variable within the while loop based on specific conditions. Additionally, we can simplify the return statements to make the function clearer.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    # Clear trailing empty lines
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    if (current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class) and not current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we've updated the `before` variable within the while loop based on specific conditions and simplified the return statements to make the function's logic more clear. This new implementation should ensure that the function returns accurate values for the given test cases.
