The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing incorrect outputs due to wrong updates and checks on the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` variables.

The main reason for the bug is that the `max_allowed` variable is being updated based on the `current_line.depth` value, however, there is a logic error in the subsequent conditional checks and updates of the `before` variable, and the `is_decorator` variable. The logic should be preserved to handle different cases and correctly determine the correct values.

To fix the bug, modify the `if` and `else` clauses that are directly related to `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator`. Correct the conditional checks, ensure proper updates and checks for the variables. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, checks and updates for `before` and `is_decorator` are properly handled according to different scenarios, ensuring the correct values are returned. This should resolve the bug and produce the expected outputs.
