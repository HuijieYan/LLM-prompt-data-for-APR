The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function may be causing the failing test. Let's analyze the potential error locations within the buggy function, as well as the cause of the bug, and suggest a strategy for fixing it.

### Error Locations:
1. The calculations of `newlines` and `before` in the `if` conditions.
2. Handling of `if current_line.is_flow_control`.
3. Handling of `if self.previous_line`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of empty lines and decorators in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in specific scenarios, causing the output to differ from the expected output in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the conditions for calculating `newlines` and `before` to ensure that empty lines are inserted as expected.
2. Handle the scenarios related to flow control and previous lines more accurately.
3. Ensure that decorators and empty lines are handled correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Be sure to thoroughly test the corrected version to ensure that it functions as expected.
