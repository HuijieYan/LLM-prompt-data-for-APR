The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is occurring because the logic in the function is not correctly handling the positioning of whitespace. The function determines when to insert empty lines based on the current line's properties and the properties of the previous line.

The function should insert empty lines based on the relationships between lines, for example, if a line defines a class or function, there should be empty lines before and after it. Similarly, if there is a change in the type of line (e.g., from import to non-import), or if a line is a flow control (e.g., \nif x:), a specific number of empty lines should be inserted.

The incorrect logic is causing inconsistent or incorrect insertion of empty lines, leading to failed tests.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified so that it correctly handles all the different scenarios and relationships between the current line and the previous line, and inserts the appropriate number of empty lines according to PEP 8 styles.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_line:
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        elif (self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        elif (self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling different types of lines and their relationships with the previous line has been updated to ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted according to PEP 8 styles. This fix should address the issues observed in the failing test cases.
