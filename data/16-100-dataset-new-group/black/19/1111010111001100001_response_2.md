Looking at the buggy function and the runtime values, we can see that the `before` variable is being reassigned multiple times, potentially leading to incorrect values. Additionally, the logic for updating `before` seems to be inconsistent, and the condition for setting `max_allowed` is not clear.

To fix the bug, we can reorganize the logic to update the `before` variable in a more consistent and clear manner. We can also simplify the logic for setting the `max_allowed` variable and remove any unnecessary reassignments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and
        self.previous_line.is_import and
        not current_line.is_import and
        depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and
        self.previous_line.is_yield and
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have simplified the logic for setting `before` and removed the unnecessary reassignments. This should address the issues and ensure that the function works correctly for the given test cases.
