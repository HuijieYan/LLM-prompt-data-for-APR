The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is that the logic for adjusting the number of empty lines is incorrect for the case when `is_decorator` is `True`. When `is_decorator` is `True`, it should not be adjusting `before` and should return `0, 0`. This part of the logic is not functioning properly, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for the case when `is_decorator` is `True` to return `0, 0`. We should also remove the unnecessary assignments of `max_allowed` and `first_leaf.prefix`, since they are not being used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        # For decorators, always return 0, 0
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 0 if current_line.depth else 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 0 if current_line.depth else 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for `is_decorator` has been modified to return `0, 0` directly. Additionally, unnecessary code has been removed.

This corrected version should now handle the different cases correctly and return the expected number of empty lines.
