The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class is causing an assertion error in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

From the error message, it seems that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not handling comments within decorators correctly, resulting in extra newlines being added or missing where they are expected. This may be due to incorrect logic in the function when handling decorators and comments.

To fix the bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be updated to handle comments within decorators properly and ensure that the expected empty lines are added or removed according to the defined rules.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        # Add handling for comments within decorators
        if (
            current_line.prefix.strip().startswith("#")
            and self.previous_line
            and (self.previous_line.is_def or self.previous_line.is_class)
        ):
            return before, 1

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have added specific handling for comments within decorators to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned according to the defined rules.

After applying this fix, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should pass the failing test and resolve the mismatch in the expected and actual output.
