```python
# Assuming the bug is caused due to incorrect initialization of the `max_allowed` variable before it is changed when the depth is 0 or 1
# Also, based on the error message and expected values, it seems that the issue is with the calculation of extra newlines for potential empty lines

# Fixing the bug by initializing the `max_allowed` variable and adding an extra condition for when `depth` is 1
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # initialize max_allowed with 1 for all other depths
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.depth == 1:
        max_allowed = 1
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same

    # ...

    return before, 0
