The bug here is likely due to the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines and indentation. The error message suggests that the number of empty lines is not as expected, and the provided test cases also show differences in the expected and actual outputs.

The issue is related to how the function calculates the number of empty lines and the `before` value for indentation.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function can be modified to correctly calculate the number of empty lines and handle the indentation based on the current line properties.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version:
- The calculations for empty lines and indentation are modified based on the conditions and properties of the current line.
- The handling of decorators, flow control, imports, and yields is revised to ensure correct formatting.

After applying these changes, the function should produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
