Based on the analysis of the runtime values and types of the input parameters, and the expected values and types of relevant variables during the failing test execution, it seems that the bug lies in the logic for handling empty lines and decorators in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

The current implementation does not properly take into account the presence of decorators and the handling of empty lines, causing the incorrect generation of output. Additionally, the function incorrectly resets the `self.previous_defs` list based on the depth.

The following changes are proposed:
1. Adjust the logic for handling empty lines and decorators to properly insert empty lines where needed.
2. Change the conditions for handling `self.previous_defs` to only reset the list in specific situations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), 1) if current_line.depth == 0 else 2
        first_leaf.prefix = ""  # Consume extra newlines
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        return 0, 0 if not self.previous_line else 2 if self.previous_line.is_decorator else 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and self.previous_line.depth == depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we address the issues with handling empty lines and decorators by adjusting the logic and conditions for each case and refining how `self.previous_defs` is updated.

By making these changes, the function should now produce the correct output that aligns with the expected values in each of the given test cases.
