The function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several `if` conditions and assignments to variables `max_allowed`, `before`, and `depth`. It operates on the `current_line` parameter to determine the number of empty lines to insert based on different conditions. The input parameters, during runtime, include `current_line.depth`, `current_line.leaves`, `self`, and some instance attributes such as `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line` when available.

The error message is an assertion error raised inside the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`. The error is due to the incorrect output returned by the function `_maybe_empty_lines` which results in a mismatch between the expected and actual values.

Potential errors occur in the setup of the `max_allowed` variable where its value is not consistently controlled. Additionally, the conditions for checking the type of `current_line` and the previous line are not correctly evaluated. These potential errors are causing the function to return an incorrect number of empty lines, leading to the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `max_allowed` value should be correctly set based on the depth of the `current_line`. Additionally, the condition checks for `current_line` and `previous_line` types should be reviewed to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the conditions mentioned in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the setup of the `max_allowed` variable and refines the condition checks, which should result in the function providing the correct number of empty lines in the given test cases.
