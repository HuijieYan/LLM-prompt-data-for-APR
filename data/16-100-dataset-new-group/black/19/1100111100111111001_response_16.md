Explanation:
The _maybe_empty_lines() function checks the depth and attributes of the current line to determine whether certain actions are needed, such as modifying the first leaf or inserting empty lines. It also references attributes of the previous line and updates a list, self.previous_defs.

The bug seems to be caused by incorrect updating of the self.previous_defs list. This list appears to be used to track previous depths, but there are cases where the list may change incorrectly, leading to incorrect decisions being made by the function.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the self.previous_defs list is updated correctly to track the correct depths as intended by the function.

Updated and corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```
Fixed code explanation:
In the updated function, the logic for updating the self.previous_defs list has been corrected. The depth is appended to the list only when the conditions are met, ensuring that the correct depths are tracked. This should resolve the issues with the function's decision-making process and make it behave correctly according to the original intended logic.
