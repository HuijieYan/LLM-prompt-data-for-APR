Based on the expected input/output values, the buggy function seems to have issues with incorrect variable values at the return stage. The buggy function needs a review before providing a corrected version.

The potential error can be located in the section where 'before' and 'max_allowed' values are updated and when handling various conditions for different line types in the file.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect values of 'before' and 'max_allowed' at the return stage. These variables are being modified based on specific conditions, and the values are not being set as per the expected values in the output.

To fix the bug, the 'before' and 'max_allowed' variables should be updated based on the specified conditions and the current line type. Their values should be set according to the expected values in the output for each condition.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function based on the expected input/output values:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    before = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the 'max_allowed' and 'before' variables are initialized with the expected default values, and then updated based on specific conditions. The return values are also adjusted based on the expected output for each condition.
