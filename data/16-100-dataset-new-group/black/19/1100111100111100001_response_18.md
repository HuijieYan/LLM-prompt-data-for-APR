The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing the failing tests. The issue is observed due to the way the function is handling the `before` variable, which determines the presence of empty lines before the current line.

The bug causes the incorrect insertion of empty lines based on the depth of current line and the type of the previous line.

The potential strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing the logic that calculates the empty lines to be inserted before the current line, especially when `before` is calculated by counting the newlines within the prefix of the first leaf from the current line or being set to 1 or 2 in the while loop. 

It is also essential to ensure the correct insertion of empty lines based on the type of the current and previous lines, specifically for decorators, def, class, import, flow control, and yield statements.

By reviewing the function, the bug seems to reside in calculating the correct number of empty lines to be inserted based on the current and previous lines. To fix the bug, we can update the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the type of the current and previous lines.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
     
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the logic to better handle the insertion of empty lines, the corrected version of `_maybe_empty_lines` should address the failing tests.
