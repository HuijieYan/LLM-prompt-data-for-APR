The potential errors in the function are:
1. The logic for updating the `before` variable inside the `while` loop may cause incorrect values to be assigned to it.
2. The logic for updating the `before` variable in the `else` block may not work as intended.
3. The conditions for returning the number of newlines and spaces at the end of the function may not cover all cases.

The cause of the bug in the function is primarily related to the incorrect updating of the `before` variable and the conditions for returning the number of newlines and spaces. The logic within the function seems convoluted and there is a lack of clarity in handling different scenarios.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve restructuring the function with clear and concise conditions for the different scenarios, and ensuring that the `before` variable is updated correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if not depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(bool(current_line.depth))
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, the conditions have been simplified and the updates to the `before` variable have been made more explicit to ensure correctness in the logic. Additionally, the conditions for returning the number of newlines and spaces have been adjusted to cover all possible cases.
