The problem appears to be with the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function seems to be designed to handle indentations, decorators, flow control statements, imports, and other specific types of lines in a file during processing. 

In multiple cases, the logic accurately modifies the number of newlines required before and after the current line of code by considering certain conditions and appending empty lines accordingly. However, the issue arises when handling certain cases such as decorators, class or def statements, and yield statements, resulting in incorrect counts of newlines before and after the processed lines. 

To fix this, it is essential to reevaluate the logic that calculates the number of newlines required before and after each line based on the conditions specific to decorators, class or def statements, and yield statements.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            return 1, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the calculation of `before` as well as insertion of newlines at various points in the function have been appropriately adjusted based on the expected conditions specific to decorators, class or def statements, and yield statements, resulting in a cleaner and more accurate implementation of the logic.
