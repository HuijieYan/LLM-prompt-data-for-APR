The buggy function seems to fail to consistently compute the number of empty lines before the current line, based on certain conditions. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is meant to calculate the number of empty lines before the current line, depending on different cases such as decorators, definitions, imports, yield statements, etc. However, based on the previous and current line, the conditions might not be evaluated properly, leading to incorrect computations and failing test cases.

One potential cause of the bug could be that conditional checks may not be considering all the edge cases. For example, there are checks for decorators and flow control, and the handling of empty lines requires additional checks.

A strategy to fix the bug could involve thoroughly reviewing the conditional checks within the function and making sure that each condition correctly reflects the intended logic. Additionally, it is important to ensure that previous line and current line state is correctly considered for the computations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, before), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, before), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks have been streamlined and the handling of empty lines has been made consistent across different cases, based on the expected input/output values and the observed runtime values. Additionally, the handling of `previous_defs` list has been updated to track previous definitions correctly.

This corrected function should address the previously failing test cases.
