The bug in the _maybe_empty_lines function appears to be related to the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before the current line. The function should return a tuple representing the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line, but based on the provided code and the failing test, it seems that the function is returning the wrong values in certain cases. 

The strategy for fixing the bug could involve:
- Reviewing the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert in different scenarios.
- Checking if the conditions for checking previous lines (e.g., is_import, is_decorator, etc.) are being applied correctly.
- Verifying the conditions for handling current_line.is_flow_control, is_import and is_yield.

Here's the corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1

    # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines if it exists
    before = min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed) if current_line.leaves else 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return 2 - current_line.depth, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
