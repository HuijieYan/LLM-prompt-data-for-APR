The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for formatting the code by adding or removing empty lines based on certain criteria. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs are not equal, which implies that the formatting performed by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is incorrect.

Upon analyzing the function, one potential error location is within the conditions and logic for determining the number of newlines to insert. It seems that the conditions and logic for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields may not be working as intended, leading to incorrect formatting.

The cause of the bug may be related to incorrect handling of the conditions for adding or removing empty lines based on the type of code snippet and its relationship with the previous line in the code. The error message further indicates that the issue might be related to the handling of comments within decorators.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining newlines based on different code snippets and their relationship with the previous line needs to be reviewed and possibly rewritten to ensure correct formatting.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields have been reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the function correctly formats the code. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
