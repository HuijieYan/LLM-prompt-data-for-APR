The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the calculation of the number of empty lines. It appears that the logic for detecting decorators, definitions, and flow controls, as well as managing previous definitions, is not working correctly.

The `case 1` does not fit the issue we are diagnosing since it is not causing any failures. The `case 4` consists of similar initial values found in earlier failing tests. The bug seems to be present in the if statements related to decorator and previous line checks.

The cases of invalid test could indicate that a decorator related check using the `is_decorator` flag could be responsible for bugs. Specifically, the `elif` block where it checks `current_line.is_decorator` and the assignment of `is_decorator` inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function might be incorrect.

To fix this, review the logic in the if-else conditions and ensure that the purpose of each block (e.g., decorators, flow controls, imports) is correctly handling the logic for determining the number of empty lines. A possible strategy could be to revise and simplify the if-else logic to correctly identify the conditions that determine the number of extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Noting the recommendations above, we might apply it to fix the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Here is a possible corrected version of it using these concepts:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This revised version should address the buggy behavior and pass the failing tests.
