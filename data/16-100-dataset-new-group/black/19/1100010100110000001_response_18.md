The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be responsible for formatting the output. The function returns a tuple containing the number of empty lines to add before the current line and the number of empty lines to add after the current line. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not producing the expected output, resulting in a failed assertion.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function which is not handling the empty lines correctly, causing the formatting of the output to be incorrect. Additionally, the function might not be correctly handling cases such as comments in decorators, imports, and yields.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the logic within the function and ensure that it correctly handles cases involving empty lines, comments, decorators, imports, and yields.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.comment and current_line.previous_line:
        if current_line.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.previous_line.is_def:
            return 0, 1

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 1

    if current_line.is_import and current_line.is_import != self.previous_line.is_import:
        return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_yield and current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have made modifications to handle cases involving comments in decorators, imports, yields, and various types of lines. This should address the issue with the formatting of the output and ensure that the failing test passes as expected.
