The issue seems to be related to the `newlines` variable, which is set to 2 if the current line is a decorator, a definition, or a class. Otherwise, it should be 0. However, for the conditional blocks that look at `current_line.depth`, they should set it to `1` for the `newlines` variable if the depth is not zero. In the first section, the block of code that checks for depth and reduces `newlines` by 1 should be removed and the depth check should be solely focused on the decorator. Additionally, there are sections where the `newlines` variable is being returned. The code to return `before` and `1` for `current_line.is_flow_control` should set `newlines` and `0` also for consistency.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```
