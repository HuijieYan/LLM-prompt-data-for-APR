The main issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it is not properly handling the calculation of empty lines before and after the current line. There are several conditional statements that are not effectively determining the correct number of empty lines to be returned.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line. The conditional statements regarding decorators, flow control, import lines, and yield lines are not accurately calculating the number of empty lines needed.

A potential strategy for fixing this bug could involve reviewing the conditional statements related to decorators, flow control, import lines, and yield lines, and updating the logic to accurately calculate the number of empty lines before and after the current line. Additionally, error handling and edge cases need to be carefully considered to ensure the correct behavior of the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    else:
        before = 1

    if self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator:
            before = 0
            after = 0
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            after = 1
        elif (
            self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            before = 1
        
        if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            before = 1

    return before, after
```
This corrected version simplifies the logic and ensures the accurate calculation of empty lines before and after the current line based on the conditions specified in the function.
