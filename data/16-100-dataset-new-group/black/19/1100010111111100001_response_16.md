The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing the failing test to produce an incorrect output. The function is intended to return the number of empty lines before and after a given line in a file, based on certain conditions. However, for each case, the function is not correctly determining the appropriate number of empty lines. This results in incorrect spacing in the generated output, leading to the failing assertion in the test. 

The issue appears to be related to the logic of the function's conditional statements that assess the specific properties of the input `current_line`. These properties include `depth`, `leaves`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. Each case reveals that the function does not consistently return the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line.

To fix the bug, we need to review each conditional statement within the function and ensure that they correctly evaluate the properties of `current_line` to determine the appropriate number of empty lines to be returned. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        return 2, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

Additionally, the function includes a conditional statement for handling cases where `current_line` represents a decorator, definition, or class line. The function now correctly considers these cases and returns the appropriate number of empty lines before and after the current line. The statement ensures that decorators are not repeated and that appropriate spacing is applied based on the given conditions.

These changes should address the bug and allow the fixed `_maybe_empty_lines` function to pass the previously failing test.
