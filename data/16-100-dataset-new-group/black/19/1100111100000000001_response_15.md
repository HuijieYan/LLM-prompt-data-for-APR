## The bug analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function has several issues:
1. It tries to use class methods like `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, etc., without using the `self` parameter to reference the instance.
2. There are multiple `append` methods without a clear indication of which one to refer to, leading to confusion in the function.
3. The conditional statements can be simplified for better readability.

## Potential error locations
1. Use of class methods without `self` reference.
2. Ambiguity in the reference to the `append` method.

## Bug cause
The main bug cause is the incorrect reference to class methods without the `self` parameter. This will lead to the function attempting to call methods that are not available in the local scope, causing errors.

## Bug fix strategy
1. Use the `self` parameter to reference class methods and attributes.
2. Provide clear references to the `append` method to avoid ambiguity.
3. Simplify the conditional statements for better readability.
