The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for determining the number of new lines to insert. The function appears to produce incorrect output under some conditions, causing the failing tests. 

Upon reviewing the runtime variable values and types from the test cases, it is evident that the 'max_allowed' value and 'is_decorator' condition are not working as intended. For example, in Case 1, the 'is_decorator' condition is true, but the calculation for 'newlines' is incorrect.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic for determining the number of new lines based on various runtime conditions. Additionally, it's essential to ensure that the 'max_allowed' value is being properly utilized and updated as needed. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator) or current_line.depth == 0:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the handling of 'is_decorator' and the logic for determining the number of new lines has been modified based on the reviewed analysis and the identified potential issue.

Please test the updated function with the failing test cases to ensure that the bug has been fixed.
