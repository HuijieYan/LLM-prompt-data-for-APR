The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be in the logic to compute the number of extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function needs to handle different cases based on the type of line and use the correct variables to calculate the required empty lines. Based on the failing test and runtime input/output values, the bug likely causes incorrect empty line calculations, leading to failing test cases.

The potential strategy for fixing the bug is to review the conditionals and variable assignments within the function to ensure that the correct values are assigned based on the type of line. Additionally, the function should consider the previous line's attributes and the previous definitions to adjust the empty lines accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function now handles each scenario such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields. It has also been updated to ensure correct calculations for the required empty lines based on the current and previous line attributes. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
