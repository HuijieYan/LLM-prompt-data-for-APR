The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be related to the logic for handling the indentation depth and the conditions for inserting empty lines. Based on the failing tests and the provided input/output variable values, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the edge cases and conditions related to the indentation depth and various line types.

To address the issue, it's important to revise the logic related to the insertion of empty lines based on the different line types, indentation depth, and the presence of preceding lines.

The potential issues identified:
1. Handling of indentation depth and the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the line type are causing the incorrect behavior.
2. Logic for handling preceding lines, decorators, imports, and flow control statements seems to be flawed, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic related to the insertion of empty lines before and after specific line types, such as decorators, imports, and flow control statements.
2. Revise the conditions for handling the indentation depth and the logic for inserting empty lines based on different scenarios and line types.

Corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if not current_line.leaves:
        before = 0
    else:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    # Conditions for handling specific line types
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        # Insert empty lines for decorators based on depth
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    # Default case, return the calculated before value
    return before, 0
```

This revised version of the function includes a review of the entire insertion logic and handling of different line types, indentation depth, and preceding lines. This version should address the issues leading to failing tests and provide the correct insertion of empty lines based on the given conditions and scenarios.
