The cause of the bug seems to be that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` does not accurately calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. Based on the various runtime input/output values, it seems that the function is not handling all the conditionals properly, leading to incorrect calculations.

To fix this bug, we would need to update the conditionals and the logic within the function to accurately determine the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. 

Specifically, paying attention to the logic that handles `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` is important, as well as revising the checks for the `previous_line` to ensure that the correct return values are being computed. Handling cases after popping `self.previous_defs` also appears to be an issue, which requires attention.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before if before else 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

The updated function addresses the logic that was mishandling conditional cases, ensuring that the correct number of extra empty lines are returned for each case.
