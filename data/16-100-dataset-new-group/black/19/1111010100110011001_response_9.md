The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues:

1. The function is not properly setting the value of `max_allowed` based on the `depth` of the `current_line`, and subsequently is not effectively using `max_allowed` within the conditional checks. This causes inconsistencies in the logic based on the `depth` of the `current_line`.

2. There is a block of code where `newlines` is being calculated, but the function returns a Tuple `(newlines, 0)` instead of `(newlines, before)` as per the expected logic.

3. There seems to be an issue with the condition checks for `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` for which the returns are not consistently using the `before` value as intended.

To fix these issues, the following strategy can be used:
- Update the assignment of `max_allowed` based on the `depth` of `current_line`.
- Update the conditional checks to properly use the `max_allowed` value and ensure consistent logic based on various conditions and flags.
- Return a correct Tuple `(newlines, before)` where applicable.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_import = current_line.is_import
    is_yield = current_line.is_yield
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, before

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these corrections, the function should behave as expected and pass the failing test.
