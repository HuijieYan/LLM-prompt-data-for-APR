The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be related to the logic for handling consecutive decorators and imports. The issue arises when determining whether to insert empty lines based on the type of the current line as well as the previous line.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the conditional blocks and assignments for `before` and the handling of previous line types.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the cases of consecutive decorators and imports properly. When determining if an empty line should be inserted, the function does not account for whether the previous line was also a decorator or import.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to revise the conditional blocks and assignments for `before` to account for cases where the previous line is a decorator or import.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or self.previous_line.is_import:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By modifying the conditional blocks to include checks for the type of the previous line when determining whether to insert empty lines, the revised function should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
