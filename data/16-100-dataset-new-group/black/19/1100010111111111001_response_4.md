The bug is caused by the incorrect manipulation of `max_allowed` and `before` values, leading to an incorrect number of newlines in the returned output.

To fix the bug, update the logic for determining the values of `max_allowed` and `before` based on the conditions specified in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    before = 0
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import \
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        before = 1 if before == 0 else before
        return before, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield \
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        before = 1 if before == 0 else before
        return before, 0

    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    return before, 0
```

Given the corrected function, it should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
