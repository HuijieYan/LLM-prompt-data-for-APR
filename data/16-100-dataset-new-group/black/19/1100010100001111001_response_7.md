The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic for calculating the `newlines` variable when `is_decorator` is True does not seem to be just right. When `is_decorator` is True or when `current_line.is_def` or `current_line.is_class`, the current logic has several conditional checks leading to the `return` statements. The problem occurs in calculating the `newlines` when `is_decorator` is True. There, it should make sure to check whether `self.previous_defs` is an empty list or not. If it is not empty, it should move the `newlines` variable from 2 to 1.

To fix this issue, we should change the condition where `is_decorator` is True. We should check, if `self.previous_defs` is not empty then reduce `newlines` by 1.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        if self.previous_defs:  # fix the conditional check
            newlines = 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected function, the condition for checking `self.previous_defs` has been added, ensuring that the correct value is returned for `newlines` when `is_decorator` is True and `self.previous_defs` is not empty. All other parts of the original function remain unchanged.
