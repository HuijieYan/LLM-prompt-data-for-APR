The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic for setting the variable 'before' within the if-else block may not be handling all cases correctly.
2. The conditions in the 'if' statements for returning newlines may not cover all relevant cases.
3. The conditions for returning 'before' and '1' in the last 'if' statement may not be capturing all relevant situations.

The cause of the bug is likely related to incorrect handling of newlines and depth conditions within the function. The failing test 'test_comment_in_decorator' could be failing because the function is not correctly inserting or removing empty lines based on the code structure and logic.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve reviewing and revising the conditions for setting the 'before' variable, as well as the return statements in the various conditional blocks. Additionally, verifying that the conditions are capturing all relevant cases for inserting or removing empty lines based on different code structures.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the 'before' variable and return conditions have been carefully reviewed and revised to ensure proper handling of empty lines based on different code structures. This should resolve the potential errors and make the function pass the failing test.
