The cause of the bug originates from the function "_maybe_empty_lines" of the EmptyLineTracker class. The function doesn't handle the logic correctly, leading to issues when calculating the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. In particular, the function does not accurately set the before value, leading to incorrect formatting of the source code. Additionally, the conditions for flow control, import checks, and yield checks are not functioning as expected.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. Ensure that the logic for flow control, import checks, and yield checks is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected function should now accurately calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the specific conditions outlined in the buggy function. Therefore, the failing test should pass with the corrected version of the function.
