The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines`, which takes in a `current_line` object and is expected to return a tuple of integers representing the number of empty lines to insert before and after the `current_line` based on certain conditions.

After analyzing the code and the failing test, it seems that the bug is occurring due to the incorrect calculation of newlines to insert before and after the `current_line`.

The potential error location lies in the block of code that handles various conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

The causes of the bugs include incorrect handling of indentation depth and incorrect conditions for inserting empty lines before and after certain types of lines (such as decorators, imports, and flow control statements).

The strategy for fixing the bug would include carefully handling the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after different types of lines, ensuring correct indentation depth is considered, and modifying the code to properly handle the mentioned conditions.

Given the information above, here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```
This corrected version addresses the logic and conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the `current_line` and should pass the failing test.
