The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it fails to return the expected number of newlines and spaces. The current implementation does not take into account the different logic needed based on various input conditions leading to incorrect output.

One potential issue is that the function assumes the value of `before`, `newlines` and `depth` should always be 0, 2, and 0 respectively. Instead, these should be reassigned based on certain conditions and returned accordingly.

To address this, we need to redefine the conditional logic to determine the values of `before` and `newlines`. Without rewriting the entire function, the conditional logic should be nested based on the control flow of the program, which will determine the correct values of `before` and `newlines` to be returned.

Given the aforementioned issues, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        if before > max_allowed:
            before = max_allowed
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if (self.previous_line.is_decorator and not is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By redefining the conditional logic, the corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It accounts for the correct assignment of `before` and `newlines` values based on the flow of the program.

This corrected version should address the bug and reflect the expected behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
