The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is used to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It contains several if-else conditions and assignments based on the values of different variables, such as `current_line.depth`, `first_leaf`, `before`, `depth`, `current_line.is_decorator`, and so on. 

It seems that the bug may be related to the incorrect usage of these variables to determine the number of empty lines needed. The current implementation uses if-else conditions with multiple assignment statements that may not be effectively addressing all cases based on the input parameters. 

To fix the bug, we should thoroughly examine the logic used within the function and ensure that all cases are being handled correctly, according to the expected input/output values provided in the failing test cases.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version, we have restructured the if-else conditions based on the expected input/output values and logically handled all the cases as per the provided failing test cases. The corrected function is expected to pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
