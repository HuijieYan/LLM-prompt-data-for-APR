## Analysis
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class takes a `current_line` as input and returns a tuple of two integers. The function makes use of various attributes and methods of the `current_line` object and also includes references to other methods like `is_import`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, and `is_yield` which are defined in the same file, but not within the same class.

## Bugs
1. The condition `if not is_decorator:` within the function is meant to check if the `is_decorator` attribute is False, but this will lead to an error as `is_decorator` is not defined as a local variable within the function.
2. There is a possibility of referencing attributes and methods of the `current_line` without first ensuring that `current_line` has been successfully assigned.
3. There is a missing check for the `previous_line` within the function before referencing the attributes of `previous_line`.

## Bug Cause
The primary bug in the function is due to the incorrect use of the `is_decorator` variable, which is expected to be referenced as an attribute of `current_line`. This erroneous reference might lead to runtime errors. Additionally, there is insufficient checking of the assignment of `current_line` and `previous_line` before accessing attributes.

## Fix
1. Add proper checks to ensure that `current_line` and `previous_line` are defined before accessing their attributes, and handle the case when they are not defined.
2. Correct the reference to `is_decorator` to make use of the attribute of the `current_line`.
3. Fix possible syntax errors that may occur due to incorrect assignments.
