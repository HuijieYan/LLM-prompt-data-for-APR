The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be responsible for adding or removing empty lines based on certain conditions. The test error message is related to the function `assertFormatEqual` failing with an AssertionError due to incorrect handling of empty lines between comments and decorators.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect logic in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` that decides the number of empty lines to be inserted based on various conditions.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve analyzing the logic for deciding the number of empty lines to be inserted based on different conditions and then adjusting it to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2  # Adjusted based on depth value
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            if depth != 0:  # Adjusted based on depth value
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for deciding the number of empty lines to be inserted has been adjusted based on the depth value and the conditions for inserting empty lines between decorators and other lines have been updated.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the function `_maybe_empty_lines` work as expected.
