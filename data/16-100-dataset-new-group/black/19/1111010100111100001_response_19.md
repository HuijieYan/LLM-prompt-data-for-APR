The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is producing incorrect results that are causing the failing test cases. The function takes a `current_line` object and returns a tuple of two integers. The goal of the function is to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The potential error locations within the function are primarily in the conditional statements that determine the return values based on the properties of the `current_line` object and other related state variables.

After analyzing the failing test cases and their inputs, it seems like the function is not handling certain scenarios properly. Some of the failures are related to the computation of newlines and before-empty lines.

Based on the provided failing test setup and inputs, the bug likely arises from incorrect calculations for `before` and `newlines` based on the properties of the `current_line` object.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements that are responsible for setting the values of `before` and `newlines` based on the characteristics of the `current_line` object need to be thoroughly reviewed and possibly re-implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 1
        newlines = 1
    elif current_line.depth == 1:
        before = 2
        newlines = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), before)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        newlines = 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines = 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        before = max(before, 1)
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        before = max(before, 1)

    return before, newlines
```

In this corrected version, the logic for calculating `before` and `newlines` has been simplified and refactored to handle various cases and edge conditions based on the `current_line` and `previous_line` objects.
