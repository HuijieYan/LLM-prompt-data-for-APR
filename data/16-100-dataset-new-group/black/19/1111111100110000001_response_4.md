The bug is likely to be in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The error message suggests that the formatting of the code is incorrect, specifically relating to the number of newlines before and after certain lines. 

The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for returning the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the newlines before and after certain types of lines, such as decorators and imports.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that it correctly handles the cases where empty lines need to be inserted before or after certain lines, particularly decorators, imports, and flow control statements.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line:
            after = 1 if self.previous_line.is_decorator else 2
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        after = 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        before = 1 if before == 0 else before
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        before = 1 if before == 0 else before
    
    return before, after
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling newlines before and after different types of lines has been simplified and corrected to address the specific cases mentioned in the error message.
