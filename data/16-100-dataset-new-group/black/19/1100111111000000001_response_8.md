The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a few issues that need to be addressed in order to fix the problem. Here are the identified potential error locations within the function:

1. Update the parameters of the function. The function parameter `self` should be updated to the appropriate class type that contains the attributes referenced within the function.

2. There are multiple references to `current_line` which might require additional checks and validations.

3. The use of `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` should be preceded by the class name or instance from which these attributes are accessed.

4. There is no definition for `Line` or `Leaf` within the function, which might cause issues with the type of data being operated on.

5. The conditional statements are complex and need to be thoroughly tested and validated.

6. The logic for adjusting `before` based on `max_allowed` and the number of newlines needs to be reviewed for correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: 'Line') -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import(self) and 
        not current_line.is_import(self) and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield(self) and 
        (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the potential issues and is expected to pass the failing test provided.
