The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have several issues related to the way it updates variables and defines conditions. It also calls some functions that are not present within the given context. 

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the condition blocks, and the inconsistencies of updating some relevant variables. The function references certain class attributes and methods that might not be defined correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and failing tests.

A strategy to fix the bug includes:
1. Reviewing the class definition `EmptyLineTracker` to ensure that all attributes and methods are properly defined and accessible within the context of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
2. Checking the logic of condition blocks, especially how variables are updated within these blocks.
3. Testing each condition and data modification separately to understand the individual impact.
4. Analyzing the expected outputs for each test case and comparing them with the actual outputs to identify discrepancies.

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the above strategy is as follows:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class Leaf:
    # Define fields of Leaf
    pass

@dataclass
class Line:
    # Define fields of Line
    pass

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_defs: list
    previous_line: Line
    # other attributes

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        first_leaf = None
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
        
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

With the above corrected version, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
