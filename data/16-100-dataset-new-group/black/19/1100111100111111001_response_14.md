The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` should be fixed to ensure it returns the correct values for the given input parameters. The issue with the existing implementation is that it does not properly handle the cases and conditions related to `if` statements and decorators. Here's a strategy for fixing the issue:

1. Ensure that the correct max_allowed value is set based on the current line's depth.
2. Properly handle cases of decorators and `if` statements to calculate the new lines and before values accordingly.
3. Update the `while` loop condition for popping previous definitions.
4. Ensure that the conditions for flow control, import, and yield are evaluated properly.

The corrected version of the buggy function will be as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if not current_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_def and not current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these changes, the corrected version of the buggy function should now account for the correct handling of cases related to the input parameters and satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
