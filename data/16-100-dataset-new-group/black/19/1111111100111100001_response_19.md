The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function likely lies in the logic for handling the `is_decorator` check. It appears that the previous line is being incorrectly set as the `current_line` rather than the intended value.

To fix this bug, we should likely reevaluate the conditions in the `if` statements that check for decorators, and perhaps ensure that the previous line is correctly stored before proceeding with the logic of the function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    # Store the previous line before manipulating
    prev_line = self.previous_line

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_def = current_line.is_def
    is_class = current_line.is_class
    is_flow_control = current_line.is_flow_control
    is_import = current_line.is_import
    is_yield = current_line.is_yield

    if is_decorator or is_def or is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not prev_line:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if prev_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if prev_line and prev_line.is_import and not is_import and depth == prev_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if prev_line and prev_line.is_yield and (not is_yield or depth != prev_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This revised version of the function includes additional checks and safeguards to ensure the correct behavior when determining the number of empty lines. Always remember to run the updated code with the failing tests to verify its correctness.
