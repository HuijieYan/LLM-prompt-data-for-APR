The bug in the buggy function is primarily due to incorrect logic for determining the number of empty lines required before and after the current line. The implementation also incorrectly updates the stateful attributes of the `first_leaf` and `self.previous_defs`.

To fix the bug, the conditions for the number of empty lines to be added before and after the current line should be reviewed and corrected. The logic for updating the stateful attributes should also be reviewed and addressed.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and not self.previous_line.is_import
            and current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function takes care of the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line, as well as the stateful attribute updates. This version should make the function correctly pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
