The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to process and return the number of empty lines that should be inserted before the current line. Based on the provided error message and expected input/output values, it seems that the function is not working correctly and needs to be debugged.

After analyzing the buggy function and the expected input/output values, the potential error locations within the function are identified to be the conditionals and assignments, particularly in handling `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to incorrect handling of indentation depth and conditions. This can lead to incorrect calculations and assignments for the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic related to indentation depth, conditions, and assignments within the function. More specifically, we should ensure that the correct values for `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` are determined and used to calculate the number of empty lines to be returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues of handling `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` by revising the assignments and conditionals based on the expected input/output values and the identified error locations. The function now calculates and returns the correct number of empty lines based on the input parameters and expected logic.
