The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely due to the incorrect insertion of empty lines. Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters, and expected values and types of relevant variables during the failing test execution, it seems that the function is not correctly calculating the number of newlines to be inserted before and after the current line.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
- Ensure that the function correctly determines the conditions that would require empty lines to be inserted.
- Properly update and return the values for `before` and `newlines` based on the logic in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Leaf:
    # define the fields for the Leaf class
    ...

@dataclass
class BracketTracker:
    # define the fields for the BracketTracker class
    ...

@dataclass
class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, comments, bracket_tracker, inside_brackets):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = comments
        self.bracket_tracker = bracket_tracker
        self.inside_brackets = inside_brackets
        

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: list

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1

        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""

        else:
            before = 0

        lines_to_insert = (before, 0)

        if current_line.depth in self.previous_defs:
            lines_to_insert = (1 if current_line.depth else 2, 0)
            self.previous_defs.remove(current_line.depth)

        elif current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if current_line.is_decorator:
                lines_to_insert = (0, 0)
            elif self.previous_line and current_line.is_def and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            else:
                lines_to_insert = (2 - current_line.depth, 0)

        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            lines_to_insert = (before, 1)

        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            lines_to_insert = (1 if before else 1, 0)

        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            lines_to_insert = (1 if before else 1, 0)

        return lines_to_insert
```

This revised function uses the input parameters and the related class attributes to correctly compute the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line. By following this approach, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
