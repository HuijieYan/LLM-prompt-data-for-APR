Based on the error message and the failing test, it seems that the `assertFormatEqual` function is failing due to incorrect handling of empty lines before and after certain lines in the `fs` function. The bug is likely located in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

Upon analysis, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines before and after certain types of lines. This is causing a mismatch in the expected and actual output of the `fs` function, leading to the failing test.

One potential cause of the bug could be the incorrect logic for determining when to insert empty lines before and after certain types of lines. This may be due to mismanagement of line depth, previous line attributes, and potential conflicts between different line types.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and carefully evaluating the conditions for inserting empty lines. Additionally, it may be necessary to ensure proper handling of line depth, previous line attributes, and different line types to determine the correct number of empty lines to insert.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2  # Update max_allowed to 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), before)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, after

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), after

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), after

    return before, after
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling different types of lines and the insertion of empty lines has been reviewed and adjusted. The conditions for adding empty lines before and after certain lines have been updated to ensure correct behavior.

This corrected version should address the bug and enable the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to pass the failing test.
