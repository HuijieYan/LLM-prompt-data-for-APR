The current function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears to be incorrectly handling the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to be inserted. The function is responsible for deciding whether to insert empty lines based on certain conditions related to the current and previous lines.

Upon analyzing the provided cases, it seems that the logic for determining whether to return empty lines or not is flawed due to incorrect handling of condition checks.

The specific issues in the function are:
1. The `is_decorator` variable should be checked while determining if the previous line was a decorator or not, and not in the block where previous line is checked for None.
2. The logic to determine the depth of the previous line and the handling of `previous_defs` list for decorators is not consistent. The control flow is incorrect.

The strategy for fixing the bugs in the function is to:
1. Correctly capture the logic for each condition being checked, including the handling of decorators, imports, flow control, and yields.
2. Adjust the logic to ensure that the correct conditions are checked in the correct order to produce the expected empty line results.

After understanding the issues, the corrected version of the function would be as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the aforementioned issues by reorganizing the conditions to ensure that each condition is checked correctly and the expected result is returned based on the current and previous lines.
