The potential issue with the current implementation of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the variable `newlines` is assigned the value `2` without considering the cases when the depth is not zero. The error message from the failing test and the runtime input/output variable values suggest that the important unhandled cases could be causing the test failures.

The cases demonstrate that the function does not handle the scenarios when the depth is not zero correctly. It does not decrease the value of `newlines` when the depth is not zero, which is likely causing the incorrect number of empty lines in the output.

To fix this, we need to consider the depth of the current line and modify the number of newlines accordingly. Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - min(depth, 1)  # Decrease newlines if depth is not zero
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the line `newlines = 2` is modified to `newlines = 2 - min(depth, 1)` to properly handle the cases when the depth is not zero.

Please test the corrected function with the provided failing tests to ensure that the issue has been resolved.
