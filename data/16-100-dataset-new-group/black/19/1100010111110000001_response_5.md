Looking at the failing test and the error message, it seems that the bug is related to the formatting of the output. The `assertFormatEqual` method is used to compare the expected formatted output to the actual formatted output, and it is failing due to differences in the formatting.

Upon analyzing the `maybe_empty_lines` function, it seems that the issue may be related to the handling of empty lines and prefixes in the code. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to add before the current line, based on various conditions related to the nature of the current line (e.g., whether it's a decorator, import, yield, etc.).

The bug is likely causing incorrect or unexpected number of empty lines to be added before the current line, resulting in differences in the formatting between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we can revisit the logic of the `maybe_empty_lines` function, especially the conditions and calculations related to adding empty lines, and ensure that it follows the expected behavior for different types of lines and scenarios.

Here's a corrected version of the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 1
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that the correct number of empty lines are added in the appropriate conditions, and the formatting of the output should now align with the expected output from the failing test.
