This buggy function is designed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the given line of code. The function seems to have issues with how it handles the `is_decorator` and `self.previous_defs` properties, as well as floor control statements and import blocks.

Based on the runtime and expected values, the cause of the bug appears to be a logic issue with the conditional statements related to decorators and previous definitions. It also seems like there is a problem with the calculation of the newlines value when the line contains decorators.

A possible strategy to fix this bug is to adjust the conditional logic to properly handle the different cases such as decorators, flow control, and previous line types.

Here's the corrected version of the function based on the analysis:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditional checks for decorators, previous definitions, file start, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields have been adjusted to better handle the cases and produce the expected outcomes.
