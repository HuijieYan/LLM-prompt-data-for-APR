The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing extra newlines to be inserted in the formatted code, leading to the failing test. The function is incorrectly handling the insertion of empty lines before certain types of lines in the code.

The bug is likely occurring where the function calculates the number of empty lines to be inserted before a line, especially in the `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` block and the `if current_line.is_flow_control` block.

To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic for inserting empty lines before certain types of lines, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is inserted according to the formatting rules.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With the above corrected version of the function, the bug causing the failing test should be resolved, and the function should pass the test.
