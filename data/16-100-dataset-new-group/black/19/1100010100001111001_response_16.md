The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is that it incorrectly computes the number of empty lines to insert before the given line based on certain conditions. There are multiple issues that are identified based on the runtime and expected values:

1. The function should return a tuple of two integers, representing the number of empty lines to insert before the given line and after the given line, respectively.

2. It appears that the checks for various conditions to determine the number of empty lines before and after the given line are not being accurately handled leading to wrong results and failing expected tests.

3. The conditions within the function are not being accurately executed leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual results.

The strategy for fixing these bugs includes ensuring that the following issues are addressed:

1. The correct number of empty lines to insert before and after the given line based on each specific condition should be correctly computed.

2. Dead code and unnecessary conditions should be removed to simplify the logic and prevent incorrect calculations.

3. Ensure that the correct tuple of the number of empty lines before and after the given line is returned.

Here is a corrected version of the function based on the identified issues and expected values:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.depth > 0):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators or in indented code blocks.
            return 0, 0
        
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            after = 1

        return 0, after

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        after = 1
        return before, after

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function correctly computes and returns the number of empty lines to insert before the given line and after the given line based on the identified bugfixing strategies and expected input/output values.
