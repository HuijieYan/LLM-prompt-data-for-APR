Based on the error message from the failing test, it seems that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because it is expecting a different number of empty lines in the `actual` output compared to the `expected` output. This can be traced back to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert in the output.

It seems there might be an issue in the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Let's analyze the function to identify the potential error locations.

The cause of the bug could be in the logic where the number of empty lines is determined based on conditions such as `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`, and other conditions. The function might not be correctly determining the appropriate number of empty lines in certain scenarios, resulting in the mismatch of empty lines in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the conditions in the function and ensure that the logic for determining the number of empty lines is correct for all scenarios.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max((before, 1)), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max((before, 1)), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, some minor adjustments are made in the conditions where the number of empty lines is determined. Additionally, nested conditions are also handled appropriately, and potential edge cases are accounted for. This should ensure that the function correctly determines the number of empty lines based on the given conditions and should resolve the issue with the failing test.
