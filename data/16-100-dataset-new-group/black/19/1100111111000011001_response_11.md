Since the buggy function has many branches and sub-functions, the cause of the bug could be in any of these sub-functions or in the overall logic of the function.

One possibility for the bug could be the logic related to the `previous_line` and `current_line`. The implementation seems to handle various conditions based on the state of the previous and current line. For example, there are conditions like `if self.previous_line is None`, `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator`, and others. One of these conditions could be incorrectly applying to input values.

Another possibility could be the manipulation of `current_line` and `first_leaf` where it might be modifying these values in an incorrect way, leading to incorrect results.

Additionally, the function uses `self.previous_defs` and modifies it conditionally which might be causing unexpected results.

A strategy to fix the bug could involve carefully analyzing each conditional branch and its effect on return values. It would involve reviewing each conditional branch for correctness and ensuring that the state transitions between `current_line` and `previous_line` are properly handled.

Given the complexity of the function and the potential interactions between different sub-functions, it may require detailed debugging and testing with various inputs to identify and fix the bug. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function based on the input provided and the expected outputs:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
        and not current_line.is_import(self)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
        and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected function should now return the expected values based on the provided test cases.
