The issue with the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to stem from the logic implemented inside the function. It appears that the function is supposed to calculate the number of empty lines to be inserted before the given line based on certain conditions related to the current and previous lines.

The potential error locations within the function include the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted and the checks for different types of lines (e.g., import, yield, flow control).

The cause of the bug may be related to the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the conditions specified in the function. Additionally, the conditions for checking the type of the current and previous lines may not be accurate, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, a strategy would involve reviewing and revising the conditions and calculations inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is determined based on the specific requirements. Additionally, the checks for different types of lines should be validated to ensure that the correct types are being identified.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines and the checks for different types of lines have been revised to address the potential issues. This updated version should pass the failing test.
