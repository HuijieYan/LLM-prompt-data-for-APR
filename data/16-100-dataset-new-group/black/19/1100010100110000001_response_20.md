The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing an incorrect number of newlines to be returned, resulting in a failed test due to a formatting mismatch.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect calculation for the `before` variable.
2. Incorrect handling of different code constructs such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation for the `before` variable in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is not correctly handling different code constructs such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields, resulting in an incorrect number of newlines being returned.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly calculate the number of newlines based on the specific code constructs and line depths.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if depth:
            newlines = 1
        else:
            newlines = 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

With these modifications, the corrected function should now handle different code constructs and correctly calculate the number of newlines, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
