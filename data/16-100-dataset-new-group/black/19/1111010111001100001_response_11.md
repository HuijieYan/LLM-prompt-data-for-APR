The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is that it is not returning the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function is not properly adjusting and calculating the number of empty lines based on the conditions provided.

1. The function receives the input parameter `current_line` and its attributes, as well as the `previous_defs` and `previous_line` from its class `EmptyLineTracker`.
2. The function sets `max_allowed` to 1, then updates it to 2 if `current_line.depth` is 0. It then checks if `current_line.leaves` is present to consume the extra newlines from the first leaf's prefix and updates it to 0 if not. It also handles the depth, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields of the current line to calculate the number of empty lines before and after.
3. The root cause of the bug is likely the incorrect handling of conditional statements, leading to incorrect calculations and returning the wrong number of empty lines.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review the logic within the function and adjust the conditional checks to accurately determine the number of empty lines and return the correct tuple.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if (
        current_line.is_decorator
        or current_line.is_def
        or current_line.is_class
    ):
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should accurately calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
