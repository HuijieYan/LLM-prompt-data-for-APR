Based on the input parameters and runtime values, it appears that the bug within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the logic of detecting empty lines. The function seems to not correctly handle different scenarios and priorities between different types of code lines, which causes it to return incorrect values in different cases as seen from the test function. 

The potential bug within the function is the handling of empty lines, especially with regards to conditionals and decorators. It is not effectively checking the conditions against the different types of code lines and the priorities between them resulting in incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to revise the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to redefine the handling of different types of code lines and the priorities between them so that the function can accurately detect and return the correct number of empty lines based on the given input.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed) 
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    if current_line.depth >= 1:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 2 - current_line.depth, 0
        return before, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

The above correction addresses the logic of detecting empty lines based on the type of code line and their priorities, and it resolves the issue with the initial buggy function.
