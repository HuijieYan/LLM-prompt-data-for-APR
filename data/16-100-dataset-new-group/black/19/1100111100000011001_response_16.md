The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues such as using the wrong inputs and updating variables in an incorrect way which is causing it to return incorrect results. 

Based on the expected values and types of variables, the following observations and suggestions can be made:

1. The `max_allowed` variable is not being updated correctly based on the condition of `current_line.depth`. It should be set to 2 if `current_line.depth` is 0, otherwise it should remain at its default value of 1.
2. If `current_line.leaves` is not empty, the `before` variable is currently being set incorrectly by counting the newlines in the `prefix` of the first leaf in `current_line.leaves`. Instead, it should be set to the number of newlines in the `prefix`, up to a maximum of `max_allowed`, and then the `prefix` should be updated to an empty string.
3. The condition to check for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, and `is_flow_control` is not working as expected. It does not accurately capture the required logic to update `newlines` and `before` based on different cases.
4. There are logical issues in the condition blocks that check for the `is_import` and `is_yield`. These conditions need to be handled more accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should now return the expected values for the given test cases.
