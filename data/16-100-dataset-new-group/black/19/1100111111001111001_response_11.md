The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be caused by incorrect conditional logic with respect to setting the `newlines` value based on the conditions for decorators, flow control, and imports. The function seems to be calculating the number of newlines to be added or removed based on the current line's attributes and its relationship with the previous lines. However, based on the failing tests and the expected values, it's apparent that the function is not handling the given scenarios properly, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix this bug, the conditional logic for calculating the number of newlines should be revised to consider the different attributes and relationships of the current and previous lines accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if not current_line.leaves:
        return 0, 0  # No leaves, so no empty lines needed

    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
    before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
    first_leaf.prefix = ""  # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_previous_decorator = self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator

    if (
        is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class
    ):
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or is_previous_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return 1, 0  # Insert one empty line

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditional logic has been adjusted to account for cases relating to decorators, flow control, imports, and yields, considering the various combinations and relationships of the current and previous lines. This revision should address the issues with the original function and provide the expected outputs for the given failing tests.
