The bug in the provided code may be due to the incorrect usage of the `self.previous_defs` list, as well as the conditions for determining the number of newlines before and after the currently processed line.

The bug causes the `max_allowed` variable to always be assigned a value of `2` if the `if current_line.depth == 0` condition is not met. This seems to be incorrect as the `max_allowed` value should be `1` if the `depth` is not equal to `0`. Additionally, the logic for determining the number of newlines before and after the currently processed line seems to be improperly updating the `before` variable and considering the conditions based on line types (e.g., `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, etc.).

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing the assignment and use of the `max_allowed` variable and revising the logic for determining the number of newlines before and after the currently processed line based on the specific requirements and conditions defined in the class's documentation.

Here's a possible corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    # Checking and updating the previous_defs list
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(bool(current_line.depth))
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Update the condition for checking is_import and is_yield
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This updated function aims to fix the bug by properly handling the `max_allowed` variable and updating the logic for determining the number of newlines before and after the currently processed line based on the input line's properties. This new version of the function should address the bug and ensure that the tests pass successfully.
