The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs because the code is not correctly determining the number of whitespace lines to be added before and after the processed line. The function's logic is complex and involves multiple condition checks based on different properties of the input `current_line`. Based on the provided runtime values, it seems that the function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines to be added before and after the processed line in certain scenarios.

The primary cause of the bug appears to be the conditional statements and the manipulation of variables such as `before`, `is_decorator`, and `depth`, which lead to incorrect conclusions. It seems that the handling of empty line checks and the evaluation of special cases such as decorators, flow control, import lines, and depth comparisons is not accurate in every situation.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional checks and the manipulation of variables based on current_line properties to ensure that the function correctly calculates the number of required empty lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (1 if max(1, current_line.depth) else 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (1 if max(1, current_line.depth) else 1), 0

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks have been rearranged and simplified to ensure correct handling of special cases, and the variable manipulations have been adjusted to properly calculate the number of empty lines.

This revised logic should address the issues presented by the failed test scenarios by correctly computing the number of empty lines to be added before and after the processed line, in line with the expectations set forth within the `EmptyLineTracker` class and `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
