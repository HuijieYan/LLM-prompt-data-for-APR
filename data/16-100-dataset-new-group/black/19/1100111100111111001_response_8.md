The bug in the function is in determining the number of newlines to be added. There are also discrepancies in the number of `newlines` and extra empty lines in the behaviors of decorators, definitions, and imports.

A potential error location in the function is when the `newlines` are determined. It should consistently follow the logic outlined in the source code and test scenarios.

The cause of the bug might be due to incorrect handling of decorators, definitions, or imports and a lack of proper assignment for the number of newlines to be added.

To fix the bug, the code for determining the number of newlines needs to be adjusted, particularly when dealing with decorators, definitions, and imports. Assign proper values to `newlines` based on the conditions outlined in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the determination of newlines based on diverse conditions and ensures that the behavior matches the expected results for the test cases provided.
