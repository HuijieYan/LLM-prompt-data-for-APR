The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing the `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail with an AssertionError. The failing test is comparing the expected and actual outputs of the `fs` function, and it is failing the assertion test with the error message indicating the difference between the two outputs.

The `_maybe_empty_lines` function has a conditional logic that checks various properties of `current_line` and `self.previous_line` to determine the number of newlines and spaces to be returned. However, the logic is not handling all cases correctly, leading to an incorrect output.

The cause of the bug can be seen in the function logic that determines the number of newlines and spaces to be returned based on whether the `current_line` is a decorator, a flow control, an import, or a yield. It seems that some of these conditions are not being handled properly, leading to incorrect numbers of newlines and spaces being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to review and update the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` to handle all possible cases correctly and ensure that the correct number of newlines and spaces are returned based on the given input.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and
            self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and
            self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I made adjustments to the conditional logic to handle the different cases based on the properties of `current_line` and `self.previous_line` correctly. This should address the bug and ensure that the correct number of newlines and spaces are returned for the given input.
