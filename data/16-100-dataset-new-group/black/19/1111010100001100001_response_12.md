The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be that the logic is incorrect and returns incorrect values for the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The returned values do not match the expected behavior as described in the class docs. The function appears to incorrectly calculate the necessary number of empty lines based on certain conditions and previous lines, which results in the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function should be refactored to correctly follow the intended logic. It would involve re-evaluating the conditions and calculations for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the input parameters and the state of the previous lines.

Here is the correct version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the correct number of empty lines is determined based on the specified conditions and correctly aligns with the intended behavior.
