The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted in certain cases. 

The function should determine the number of empty lines needed to be inserted based on various conditions such as the depth of the current line, type of line (like decorator, definition, flow control, etc.), and the previous line.

Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the variables right before the buggy function's return, it seems that the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on different cases is not working as expected. 

To fix the bug, the function should be refactored to accurately implement the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on different conditions as mentioned above.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if any([
        current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class,
        current_line.is_flow_control,
        (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth),
        (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth))
    ]):
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    return 2, 0
```

With this corrected version, the function should return the accurate number of empty lines in different cases based on the input parameters and the related conditions from the failing test cases.
