The bug is caused by the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which is not calculating the number of empty lines correctly in all cases. The function is supposed to handle various cases based on the current line and the previous line, as well as certain flags and variables. However, the logic is inconsistent and does not cover all relevant cases.

Strategies for fixing the bug include:
- Refactoring the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that it covers all relevant cases and accurately determines the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- Adding comments to the code to clearly explain the logic and decision-making process behind determining the number of empty lines in each case.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
