Based on the provided information, the main problem with the `_maybe_empty_lines` method seems to be in the logic related to the creation of new lines. It doesn't correctly handle the cases where empty lines need to be inserted before or after the current line. To address this issue, we need to modify the logic on how new lines are added.

The expected behavior of the function is to return a Tuple where the first value is the number of potential extra empty lines needed before the currently processed line, and the second value is the number of potential extra empty lines needed after the line.

Here's a potential fix for the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    else:
        before = 1
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is not None and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            after = 0
        else:
            after = 1

        if current_line.depth:
            after -= 1
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        after = 1
    else:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            before = max(before, 1)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            before = max(before, 1)

    return before, after
```

This revised function adjusts the logic to correctly calculate the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on the input parameters and previous line information.

Please integrate this corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` function into your code and ensure that it satisfies all the expected inputs and outputs as described in the test cases.
