The bug in the buggy function arises due to improper conditional logic and incorrect variable assignments. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to create new lines based on the input `current_line` and the state of previous lines. However, the code makes unintended and incorrect decisions that need rectification.

The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes `self` and `current_line` as input parameters. It calculates the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line, as well as conditions for handling specific line types and contents.

The issue arises in different conditional branches, such as with the handling of decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields. Variable assignments and conditions within these branches must be corrected to ensure proper operation.

Since the purpose of the function is to manage the number of empty lines before each line in a code file, it should handle various scenarios by considering the properties of all types of lines and their relationship to preceding lines, based on which it determines the number of newlines to be inserted before the current line.

In order to fix this bug, a correct strategy would be to systematically review and adjust the conditional statements and variable assignments within each branch of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, ensuring they correspond to the correct logic required for handling different types of lines and their relationships to previous lines.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.depth:
        newlines = 1

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if current_line.depth:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before if before else 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

After modification, this new version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values for all the mentioned cases.

Please note that this modified version is based on partial information from the given code and test cases, and it is recommended to validate and thoroughly test the changes in a local development environment before deploying them into production.
