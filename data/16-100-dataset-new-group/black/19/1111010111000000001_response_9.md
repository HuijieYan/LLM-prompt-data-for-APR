The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the conditional statements, specifically those that check for the conditions related to `self.previous_line` and `is_decorator`.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which is not correctly handling the conditions to determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

To fix the bug, the strategy should involve reviewing and updating the conditional logic in the function, particularly the conditions related to `self.previous_line` and `is_decorator` to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the specified conditions.

Based on the analysis, here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

The suggested corrections involve adjusting the conditional statements to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the specified conditions. Once these changes are made, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
