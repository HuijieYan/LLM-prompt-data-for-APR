After analyzing the buggy function and the error message, it appears that the bug is related to the incorrect handling of empty lines within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The error message from the failing test shows a mismatch in the expected and actual output, specifically related to the insertion of empty lines within the code.

Upon reviewing the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it seems that the logic for handling empty lines based on various conditions such as depth, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields is flawed. This flawed logic is leading to the unexpected insertion of empty lines, resulting in the mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix this bug, a strategy can be employed to reevaluate the conditions for inserting empty lines and make necessary adjustments to ensure the correct insertion based on the context of the code.

With that in mind, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function includes modifications to the conditions and logic for inserting empty lines, ensuring that they are inserted correctly based on the context of the code. This corrected version is expected to pass the failing test.
