The potential error in the function lies in the while loop, as it does not contain a clear condition for breaking out of the loop. Additionally, the logic for determining the number of newlines to return is unclear.

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the number of new lines and depth. The conditionals for `is_decorator`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` are not clear about how they should affect the number of new lines.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for determining the number of new lines and adjust the `while` loop to terminate properly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0
    if (current_line.depth and not current_line.is_decorator) or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
        newlines = 1
    else:
        newlines = 2
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the while loop has been modified to properly eliminate the depth condition for the final assessment. The conditions for determining the number of new lines have been modified to handle the different cases specified in the input parameters more accurately.
