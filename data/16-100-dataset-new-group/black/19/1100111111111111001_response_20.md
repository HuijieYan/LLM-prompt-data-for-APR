The bug in the provided code seems to be the incorrect assignment of the variables `max_allowed`, `first_leaf`, `before`, and `is_decorator`. These variables are expected to be assigned specific values based on the input `current_line` properties, but their assignment in the buggy function is not consistent with the expected behavior. Additionally, the `newlines` variable is incorrectly determined.

To fix the bug, the incorrect assignments should be corrected, and the value of `newlines` should be assigned based on specific conditions in the code.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = len(first_leaf.prefix.split("\n"))

        # Replace the newlines in the prefix with an empty string
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if (is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class) and (self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator):
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        else:
            newlines = 2

        return newlines, 0
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, `max_allowed` is initialized according to the condition `if current_line.depth == 0`. The variable `before` is determined based on the newlines present in the prefix of the first leaf. `newlines` is assigned based on specific conditions. Incorrect assignments and checks that do not align with the expected behavior have been updated. After fixing the buggy function with the corrected version, the failing test cases should now pass.
