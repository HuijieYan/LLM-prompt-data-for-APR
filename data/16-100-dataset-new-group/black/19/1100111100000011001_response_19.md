Based on the description and the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution, it is clear that the buggy function "_maybe_empty_lines" has some logic issues. Here's a brief analysis of the issues and a strategy for fixing the bug:

Issues:
1. The function is using "self" to reference class attributes and methods, but the function itself is not within a class. This can lead to NameErrors.
2. There are multiple instances of functions with the same name "is_import" which can cause confusion and might lead to issues when calling the function.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the function has access to the variables and methods it needs by passing them as arguments or defining the function within a class where those variables and methods exist.
2. Update the function to use specific namespaces to prevent name clashes and confusion.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(empty_line_tracker, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while empty_line_tracker.previous_defs and empty_line_tracker.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        empty_line_tracker.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            empty_line_tracker.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if empty_line_tracker.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if empty_line_tracker.previous_line and empty_line_tracker.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        empty_line_tracker.previous_line
        and empty_line_tracker.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == empty_line_tracker.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        empty_line_tracker.previous_line
        and empty_line_tracker.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != empty_line_tracker.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the "empty_line_tracker" object is used to access class attributes instead of "self". The function takes "empty_line_tracker" as an argument to ensure that it has access to the necessary variables and methods. Additionally, using specific namespaces prevents name clashes and confusion related to calling different functions with the same name.
