To fix the bug, we need to handle the logic of appending empty lines correctly based on the given set of conditions. The original function seems to have incorrect logic for handling conditions and appending empty lines.

The buggy function, `_maybe_empty_lines`, seems to incorrectly calculate how many before and after empty lines should be added based on the given set of conditions. Here's a summary of the issues observed in the buggy function alongside potential fixes.
1. Incorrect handling of `is_decorator`: The function incorrectly calculates the newlines based on whether the line is a decorator or not.
2. Handling of conditions for import and yield statements is incorrect: The conditions specified for these cases might not be accurately achieved leading to incorrect return values.

We'll provide a corrected version of the function to address the identified issues. Here's the proposed fix:

```Python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    else:
        before = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), 2)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line and not current_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_yield:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or self.previous_line.depth != current_line.depth):
            return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    return before, after
```

The corrected function updates the logic to ensure the appropriate number of before and after empty lines are appended based on the given set of conditions.

This updated function should address the identified issues. Please replace the existing `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the corrected version and verify if it resolves the failing test cases.
