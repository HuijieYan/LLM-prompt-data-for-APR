There are multiple potential errors found within the _maybe_empty_lines function:
1. The usage of the 'current_line' and 'first_leaf' objects is not well defined and may lead to inconsistent behavior.
2. The manipulation of the 'before' variable inside the while loop seems to be unnecessary and could produce incorrect results.
3. The conditions for returning values based on different states or properties of 'current_line' are complex and need to be reviewed thoroughly.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not effectively handling different scenarios of line types and states, resulting in incorrect computation of the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to simplify the conditions and logic of the function by refactoring it and adding proper checks and conditions for each scenario. Additionally, a clear definition and initialization of the variables used within the function should be implemented to avoid unintended side effects.

Here is a corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    newlines = 0
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is not None:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                newlines = 0
            elif current_line.depth > 0:
                newlines = 1
            else:
                newlines = 2
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I combined some conditions where it made sense and removed unnecessary checks. The variable names and their uses have been aligned with the expected outcomes for different cases. Also, proper checks have been added to avoid potential errors.
