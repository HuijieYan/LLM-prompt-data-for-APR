Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- Incorrect use of depth comparison in the while loop condition.
- Incorrect use of the "previous_defs" list.
- Incorrect use of the "is_decorator" function.
- Incorrect use of the "is_def" function.
- Incorrect use of the "is_class" function.
- Incorrect logic in the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to return.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect condition checks and the incorrect manipulation of the variables related to determining the number of empty lines.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the conditions for checking depth and leaf properties.
2. Verify the usage of the "previous_defs" list and compare it with the depth variable.
3. Use the correct functions to check if the line is a decorator, definition, class, flow control, import, or yield.
