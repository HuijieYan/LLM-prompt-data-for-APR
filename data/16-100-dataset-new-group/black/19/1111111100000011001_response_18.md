The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of some conditions, such as the calculation of `newlines` and the management of `self.previous_defs`. To fix this bug, we can refactor the function to properly handle these conditions and return the expected values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
