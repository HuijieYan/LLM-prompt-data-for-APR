The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple conditional statements and uses several variables from related functions in the same file. The potential error locations are in the conditional blocks where different conditions are checked.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is likely related to the logic in the conditional statements, especially with the use of variables from related functions without handling potential conflicts or inconsistent data.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to carefully review the conditional statements and the usage of variables from related functions, ensuring that they are correctly referenced and handled. It might also be necessary to update the related functions if any inconsistencies are found.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
     
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    depth = current_line.depth
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
   
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return current_line.depth > 0, 0

        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the variable `is_decorator` is assigned at the beginning of the function, and the `before` variable handling has been moved outside the conditional block. Additionally, some conditional statements have been simplified and the logic has been adjusted in accordance with the use of related functions.

This version should provide a more consistent and correct behavior.
