The issue in the provided code seems to be the incorrect computation of the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the cases where decorators, def, class, and import are indicated. The function seems to be incorrectly calculating the number of empty lines based on different rules.

The cause of the bug is that the logic is not correctly handling the different conditions specified for decorators, def, class, and import. Additionally, the logic to handle the different line depths is not properly applied in certain conditions.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be revised to correctly handle the different scenarios for decorators, def, class, and import as well as the line depths.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic to handle the different conditions for decorators, def, class, and import has been updated to accurately calculate the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line. It also correctly handles the line depths in different scenarios.

This corrected version should provide a fix for the bug in the provided code.
