To fix the buggy function, the first step is to identify potential error locations within the function that may be causing the issue. 

Looking at the code and the expected input/output values, it seems that the issue might be related to the handling of the `is_decorator` condition and the manipulation of the `previous_defs` list. The function might be incorrectly returning values in certain cases or not updating the state variables as expected. 

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve thoroughly reviewing the logic of the function, checking each conditional statement and variable manipulation, and making sure that the expected conditions and updates are correctly handled. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
