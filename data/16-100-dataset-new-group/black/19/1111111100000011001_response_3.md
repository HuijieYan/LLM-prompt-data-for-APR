The bug in the _maybe_empty_lines function is caused by incorrect logic and variable assignment. The expected behavior of the function is to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It has to consider multiple conditions like the depth, leaves, previous and current line types.

I have corrected the function based on the expected input/output values and potential error locations within the buggy function. I referred to the values and types of the buggy functionâ€™s parameters, and the expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
        not current_line.is_import and
        current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
        (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```
I made a few changes to remove unnecessary conditions and refined the assignment of the variables based on the input parameters and expected output values provided. The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
