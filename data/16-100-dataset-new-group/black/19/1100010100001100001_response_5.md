The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it does not return the correct values for the `newlines` and `before` variables based on the given input parameters. The function has multiple conditional blocks that modify the values of `newlines` and `before` but does not provide a consistent return for these variables. Additionally, there is a logic issue for when to add an empty line before the first line in the file.

To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, you would need to apply the following strategy:
1. Set the initial values for `newlines` and `before` variables at the start of the function.
2. Adjust the conditional blocks to provide the correct values for `newlines` and `before` based on the input parameters and their states.
3. Ensure that the condition for adding an empty line before the first line in the file is correctly handled.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 1
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the initial values for `before` and `newlines` are set at the beginning of the function. The conditional blocks are adjusted to reflect the correct values for the return variable based on the input parameters, and the condition for adding an empty line before the first line in the file is handled appropriately.
