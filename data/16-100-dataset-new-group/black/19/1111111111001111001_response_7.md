The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for modifying the `before` variable in the function. The function takes in the `current_line` and modifies various properties within itself and in the `Line` class, such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. It also modifies the `prefix` and `leaves` properties of the `current_line`. The bug results in incorrect line termination and indentation counts which affect the logic for handling empty lines. 

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the logic for calculating the `before` variable and adjust the handling of various line properties and the previous lines to ensure that the correct empty line counts are returned.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which takes into account the scenarios mentioned in the failing test cases and the expected variable values:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return min(1, current_line.prefix.count("\n")), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return min(1, current_line.prefix.count("\n")), 0

    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0] if current_line.leaves else None
    before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed) if first_leaf else 0
    if not current_line.leaves:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2

    return before, 0
``` 

This fix should address the issue and produce the expected results for each failing test case.
