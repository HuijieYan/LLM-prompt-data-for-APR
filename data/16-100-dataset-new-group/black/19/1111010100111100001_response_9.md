The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears to be broken due to the incorrect calculation of empty lines in its logic. The function is expected to return the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, based on the input/output variables and runtime values, the function does not provide the expected results in some scenarios.

In Case 1, the function does not return the correct output values because the logic inside the condition related to decorators is not properly handled. Similarly, in Case 2, the function does not produce the expected output for the given input values, which indicates a bug in the function's logic.

After analyzing multiple cases, it can be observed that the function has issues handling different scenarios and making accurate computations of empty lines based on the provided input.

The cause of the bug could be due to the incomplete handling of different conditional branches in the function, leading to incorrect output values.

To fix the bug, the function's logic should be revised to ensure that it properly handles each conditional case and accurately computes the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            return 1, 0
    elif current_line.is_class or current_line.is_def:
        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            elif self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                return 1, 0
        return 2, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif current_line.is_import and self.previous_line and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    else:
        return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the function includes distinct handling for each conditional case, ensuring accurate computation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It should pass the failing test and provide the expected results for different input scenarios.
