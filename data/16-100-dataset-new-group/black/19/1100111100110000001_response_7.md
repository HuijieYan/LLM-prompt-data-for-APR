The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines to be inserted between code blocks. The function is supposed to determine how many empty lines to add before the current line based on various conditions such as the type of line (import, decorator, etc.) and the depth of the current and previous lines.

The failing test message shows that the actual output does not match the expected output, and specifically mentions issues with comments in decorators and the number of empty lines.

One potential cause of the bug could be the incorrect calculation of the `newlines` variable when checking for decorators and empty lines before the first line in the file.

To fix the bug, we can reorganize the logic for calculating empty lines and the handling of different line types to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the given conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for calculating `before` and `newlines` has been reorganized, and conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields have been revised to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is calculated based on the given conditions. This should address the bug and make the function behave as intended.
