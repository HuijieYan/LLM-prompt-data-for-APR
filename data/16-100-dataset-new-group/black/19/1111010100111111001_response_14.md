The issue with the buggy function seems to involve the nested if-else conditions and the logic applied to the variables `max_allowed`, `first_leaf`, `before`, `depth`, and `is_decorator`. The logic involving these variables should be re-evaluated to ensure that the correct number of empty lines are returned based on the different conditions.

The issue with the function is its failure to correctly calculate and return the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function is designed to provide a stateful method that takes a `current_line` of type `Line` and returns the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after it.

In the failing test, we can observe that the expected and actual outputs differ, and after analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we can identify that the logic pertaining to calculating the required number of empty lines is flawed.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to correctly calculate the required number of empty lines based on the given conditions and parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import 
        and not current_line.is_import 
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield 
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

The revised function enhances the correctness of the logic based on provided parameters and conditions. This version should rectify the bug and ensure that the expected number of empty lines is correctly returned for each case.
