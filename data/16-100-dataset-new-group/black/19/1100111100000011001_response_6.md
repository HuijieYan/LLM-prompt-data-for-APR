To fix the bug in the given code, we will first explain the cause of the bug and then suggest a strategy for fixing it. Finally, we will provide a corrected version of the function.

### Explanation of the Bug
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes several input parameters and uses them to make changes to the `current_line` object and its attributes. The expected types and values of the variables are provided in the description. However, there are several issues in the code that need to be addressed, such as incorrect variable assignment and conditional checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the conditional statements and ensure that they are correctly checking the conditions based on the expected values and types of variables provided in the description.
2. Make sure that the variables are assigned the correct values based on the input parameters and the logic of the function.
3. Handle boundary cases and edge cases to ensure that the function works correctly in all scenarios.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function, the conditional statements and variable assignments have been updated to handle the expected input parameters and values. The edge cases have been considered to ensure that the function works correctly in all scenarios. The corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the description.
