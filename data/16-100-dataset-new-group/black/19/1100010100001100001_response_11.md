The identified issue in the buggy function seems to be caused by cases where empty lines should not be inserted. The conditional statements are not handling all scenarios correctly, resulting in incorrect empty line counts being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic and handling of various statements to correctly determine when and how many empty lines should be inserted.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if (
        is_decorator 
        or current_line.is_def 
        or current_line.is_class 
        or current_line.is_flow_control 
        or (self.previous_line 
            and self.previous_line.is_decorator)
    ):
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_import:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these changes, the function will correctly handle different scenarios and return the appropriate counts of empty lines.
