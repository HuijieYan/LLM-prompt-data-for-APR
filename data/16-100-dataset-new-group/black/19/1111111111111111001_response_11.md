The issue appears to be in the logic that either appends 1 or 2 newlines before the processed line. The newlines should be appended before the first line in the file, whereas if the current line is a flow control statement, it should append newlines after the current line. The other conditions appear to be correctly implemented as they have a specific number of newlines to return based on a set of conditions. 

The implementation is incorrect perhaps due to not considering all the possible cases where different numbers of newlines should be appended. Since the exact requirements are not clear, we will make educated guesses based on the given details. 

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return 0, 1

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
```

In this corrected function:
- We have added cases specifically for handling the first line in the file and for flow control statements.
- For the case where newlines are inserted after the current line, the corrected function sets the value `newlines` to 2 by default and then decrements it by 1 if needed.

This correction should address the issues with the original implementation and ensure that the function behaves as expected based on the given details. However, if the provided details do not fully capture the specific requirements for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, further adjustments might be necessary.
