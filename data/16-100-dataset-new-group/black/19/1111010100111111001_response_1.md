Based on the provided runtime input/output and expected input/output values, the main bug in the function is related to the values of `before` and `newlines`. The variables `before` and `newlines` are calculated within the function to determine the number of empty lines to add before and after the currently processed line. However, the runtime input/outputs and expected input/outputs indicate that the calculation for these values is incorrect, leading to an incorrect judgment of the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the line.

To fix this bug, you can modify the section of the function related to the calculation of `before` and `newlines` based on conditions and states. A suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully inspect the conditions and state of the code that determine how `before` and `newlines` should be calculated. Then, correct any logical errors in this calculation to align with the expected behavior of determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the line.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected function addresses the logical errors in the calculation of `before` and `newlines`. This revised implementation is intended to align with the expected behavior of determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the line, ensuring that it passes the tests and satisfies the expected input/output values.
