The bug seems to be related to the way the `before` variable is being reassigned inside the while loop, leading to incorrect values. This results in unexpected newlines being added or not added when returning the results.

The `before` variable is being reused to keep track of extra newlines needed before and after the currently processed line. Inside the while loop, the value of `before` is updated based on the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2`, which seems incorrect.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to introduce a new variable to keep track of the number of newlines added in the loop. This will help in keeping the track of the number of newlines added distinct from the `before` variable, which is used to calculate the number of newlines needed before the current line. This can be done by introducing a `newlines` variable inside the while loop and using it to keep track of the number of newlines added.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    added_newlines = 0  # New variable introduced to keep track of added newlines
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        added_newlines = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - added_newlines  # Subtract the added newlines from the total newlines
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The introduced `added_newlines` variable keeps track of newlines added inside the while loop, ensuring the correct calculation of newlines needed before the current line and the newlines to be added in general.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
