Based on the input and expected values, it seems that the `before` value and its computation might be the cause of the failing test cases. In the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`, the computation of the `before` variable checks the `first_leaf.prefix` and sets `before` to the minimum of `first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")` and `max_allowed`. However, even when a valid value is found for `first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")`, it is then set to an empty string and not used to update `before` again.

To fix the issue, the following corrected version of the buggy function is provided:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        # Remove consumed newlines from first_leaf.prefix
        first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.replace("\n", "", before)

    else:
        before = 0
    
    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

In this corrected version, after calculating the `before` value based on `first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")`, it is also removed from the `first_leaf.prefix` using the `replace` function. This way, the original computation of `before` is effectively used when returning the value.
