Based on the failure's stack trace it looks like the bug might be in the way the function returns `newlines` and `before` values. It is not updating correctly the expected output values. Therefore, we will treat every possible return case separately.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to add the reset and update of `newlines` and `before` through the function, ensuring that the depth is verified correctly. We'll also adjust the newlines condition and the return of the function when the indentation depth is 0.

Here's the corrected version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    newlines = 0
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (
            self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        ):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file
            # or between decorators
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1  # Two newlines minus 1 in any other scenario
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        before = 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        before = before or 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (
            not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth
        )
    ):
        before = before or 1

    return before, newlines
```
