To fix the `EmptyLineTracker._maybe_empty_lines()` function, it is essential to modify the logic to perform the intended checks and update the variables appropriately. Here's a corrected version of the function that should satisfy the given input/output requirements:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet. It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines. Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        if current_line.depth <= self.previous_after:
            before += 1
            self.previous_after = 0
        else:
            self.previous_after = 1
        if not any([
            current_line.is_decorator,
            current_line.is_def,
            current_line.is_class,
            current_line.is_flow_control,
            current_line.is_yield
        ]):
            new_lines_before = before
            new_lines_after = 0
        else:
            new_lines_before = 0
            new_lines_after = 0
            if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                if not current_line.is_import and not (
                    self.previous_line.is_yield and
                    (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
                ):
                    new_lines_before = before if before == 2 else 1
                if current_line.depth != 0:
                    new_lines_before -= 1
        return new_lines_before, new_lines_after
```

This corrected version of the function should address the logical issues in the initial implementation and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
