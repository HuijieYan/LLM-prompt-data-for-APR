The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely causing issues with empty lines and formatting. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output, specifically regarding the presence of empty lines.

The possible error locations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function include the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. There are conditional statements and comparisons related to the presence of empty lines, decorators, imports, yields, and flow control, which could potentially lead to incorrect calculations.

The cause of the bug appears to be that the function is not calculating the correct number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual output when comparing the formatting of the code.

To fix the bug, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line needs to be carefully reviewed and adjusted. Specifically, the conditional statements and comparisons related to empty lines, decorators, imports, yields, and flow control should be revised to ensure accurate calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for checking decorators, imports, yields, and flow control have been updated to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is calculated based on the current line's properties. Additionally, a minor update was made to the calculation of empty lines before imports and yields to use the `max` function to ensure the correct number is returned.

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
