## Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to handle the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on certain conditions. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` seems to be checking for comments within decorators, and the error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the number of empty lines inserted.

### Potential Error Location
1. The logic for handling decorators and empty lines might be incorrect.
2. The conditions for flow control, imports, and yield might be impacting the number of empty lines erroneously.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic for handling decorators and empty lines. The function is not correctly identifying when to insert empty lines before and after decorators, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Review the logic for handling decorators and empty lines and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before and after decorators.
2. Check the conditions for flow control, imports, and yield to ensure they are not impacting the number of empty lines erroneously.

## Corrected Version
```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle the empty line insertion logic correctly, and the failing test should pass with this fix.
