The cause of the bug is that the logic in the function `_maybe_empty_lines()` is not properly handling various scenarios related to prefixes, newlines, line indentation, and control flow of the code.

The function takes the current line as input and is supposed to return the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line, and also whether the line is a flow control line or not.

Here are the identified potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. Incorrect logic while handling `before` variable in different cases.
2. Inconsistent handling of `max_allowed` and `before` variables.
3. Inadequate checks for cases in `if` conditions.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve cleaning up and simplifying the logic, ensuring that indentation, prefixes, and newlines are appropriately handled based on the context of the input line.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    
    # Cases related to decorators, def, and class
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
            return newlines, 0

    # Case related to flow control
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    # Case related to imports and yield
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and (self.previous_line.is_import or self.previous_line.is_yield)
        and (depth == self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version handles different cases in a simplified manner and ensures that the proper number of newlines and other indicators are returned based on the context of the input line.

Make sure to test the corrected function with the failing test cases to confirm that it passes the tests.
