From the provided code and runtime values, it appears that the bug occurs when the `_maybe_empty_lines` function tries to modify the `first_leaf.prefix` attribute for the `first_leaf` in the current line.

The issue is that in each execution of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the `first_leaf.prefix` is cleared (''), which leads to incorrect assumptions and outputs based on the presence of newlines in the `first_leaf.prefix`.

Additionally, there are certain cases where the `before` value is calculated and it either does not account for the `max_allowed` value correctly or is not being used appropriately in the return statement.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `first_leaf.prefix` is not consistently cleared and that the `before` value is properly calculated and used in the return statement based on the given conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With the updated function, it properly calculates the `before` value using `first_leaf.prefix` and ensures that it is correctly utilized in the return statements based on the given conditions. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test cases.
