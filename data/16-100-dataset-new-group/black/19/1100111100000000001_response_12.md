The buggy function seems to be related to code formatting and determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The potential error locations within the function include the conditional checks and the updating of the `before` variable. 

The cause of the bug could be related to the inconsistent handling of the `before` variable and the assignment of newlines before returning the final tuple. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is handled consistently and that the newlines are calculated correctly for different conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(leaf)
        and not current_line.is_import(leaf)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(leaf)
        and (not current_line.is_yield(leaf) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the newlines are calculated consistently for different conditions, and the `before` variable is handled correctly. Additionally, the function calls `is_import` and `is_yield` functions with the `leaf` parameter to ensure proper checks.
