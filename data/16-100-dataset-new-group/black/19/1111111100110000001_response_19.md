### Analysis
The error message indicates an issue with the formatting of comments within a decorator. This suggests that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which is responsible for handling formatting of lines, may have a bug related to decorators and comments.

### Bug Location
The bug could be located in the logic that handles decorators and comments within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

### Bug Cause
Based on the error message, it seems that the function might not be correctly identifying comments within decorators and therefore not formatting them properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug fix strategy involves reviewing the logic related to comments within decorators and ensuring that the formatting of comments within decorators is handled correctly.

### Bug Fix
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # existing code...

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1  # Change from 2 to 1
        if current_line.depth:  # Remove this if else block as it's not necessary
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    # existing code...
```

By making the specified changes to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it should now correctly handle comments within decorators and pass the failing test.
