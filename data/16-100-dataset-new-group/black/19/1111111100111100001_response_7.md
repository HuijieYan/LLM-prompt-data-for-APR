The bug seems to be related to how the function `_maybe_empty_lines` calculates the number of empty lines. It appears to be incorrectly combining the logic for handling decorators, imports, flow control, and yields.

The provided runtime tests show various cases where several attributes and instances are used to calculate the number of empty lines between blocks of code. It appears that the function is generating an incorrect number of newlines based on the input.

The function may incorrectly calculate the number of required newlines for specific combinations of keywords or syntax components, leading to inconsistencies in the output.

To fix the bug, the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be thoroughly reviewed and updated to handle different combinations of line elements, including decorators, imports, flow control, and yields.

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        empty_lines_before = 0
        empty_lines_after = 0

        max_empty_lines_before = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_empty_lines_before = 2

        if current_line.is_decorator:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                empty_lines_before = 0
                empty_lines_after = 0
            else:
                empty_lines_before = max_empty_lines_before
        elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if depth > self.previous_line.depth:
                empty_lines_before = 0
            else:
                empty_lines_before = max_empty_lines_before
        elif current_line.is_yield:
            if depth != self.previous_line.depth:
                empty_lines_before = max_empty_lines_before
            else:
                empty_lines_before = 0
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            empty_lines_after = 1
        elif current_line.is_import:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                empty_lines_before = 1
            else:
                empty_lines_before = max(empty_lines_before, 1)
        else:
            # Default behavior
            empty_lines_before = max_empty_lines_before

        return empty_lines_before, empty_lines_after
```

The logic has been refactored to more clearly handle empty line calculations according to the types of lines. This adjusted implementation should fix the bug and solve the failing test cases.
