This function has multiple issues and cases where the code is not properly handling conditions. The primary issue appears to be mishandling the `before` and `newlines` variables, which are ultimately used to determine the return values.

Potential errors:
1. The handling of `before` and `newlines` is inconsistent and seems to be affecting the expected return values.
2. The use of `depth` and `is_decorator` might not be properly evaluated in the context of calculating the return values.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing incorrect decisions to be made regarding the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This is causing the function to return incorrect values, failing the test.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the handling of `before` and `newlines` to ensure consistent and accurate determination of the number of empty lines needed.
2. Check the conditions related to `depth` and `is_decorator` to ensure that they are properly evaluated and used to determine the return values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2 - current_line.depth
    return newlines, 0
```

This revised function addresses the handling of `before` and `newlines` and adjusts the conditions related to `depth` and `is_decorator` to ensure accurate determination of return values. This should resolve the issues and make the function pass the failing test.
