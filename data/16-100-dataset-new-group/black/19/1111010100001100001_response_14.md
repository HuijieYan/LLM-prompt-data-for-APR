The bug arises from the calculations and returns in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Based on the given runtime input and output values, it's clear that the function is not correctly computing the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. This issue is likely due to incorrect handling of various conditions such as decorators, imports, flow control, and the previous line.

To fix the bug, a strategy might involve reevaluating the logic and conditions within the function, ensuring that the correct empty line quantities are calculated and returned based on the specific context and relationships between the current line and the previous one.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 1
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    if self.previous_line:
        if (
            self.previous_line.is_decorator or 
            self.previous_line.is_import or 
            self.previous_line.is_yield
        ):
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_flow_control:
            after = 1
            return before, after
        elif current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            before = 1
            after = 0
            return before, after
        else:
            before = 2
            after = 0
            return before, after
    
    return before, after
```

In the corrected version, the function now calculates the required number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the given conditions and relationships with the previous line. It ensures that the correct logic is followed for each case, such as decorators, imports, flow control, and indentation depth.
