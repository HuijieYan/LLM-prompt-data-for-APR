### Analysis
The `@dataclass` decorator indicates that the `EmptyLineTracker` class is meant to be a data class, but the `@dataclass` decorator is missing from the import statements. Additionally, the `Line` type used as a parameter to the `_maybe_empty_lines` method is not defined or imported.

### Identified Issues
1. Missing import for `@dataclass` decorator.
2. `Line` type is used as a parameter but not defined or imported.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the provided function is due to missing imports for `@dataclass` decorator and the undefined `Line` type, which is used as a parameter for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method. This causes the test to fail because the `_maybe_empty_lines` method cannot be called correctly without the `Line` type.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Import the missing `@dataclass` decorator to fix the declaration of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. Define or import the `Line` type used as a parameter for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Define or import the Line type
class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth: int, leaves: List, prefix: str, is_decorator: bool, is_def: bool, is_class: bool, is_flow_control: bool, is_import: bool, is_yield: bool):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.prefix = prefix
        self.is_decorator = is_decorator
        self.is_def = is_def
        self.is_class = is_class
        self.is_flow_control = is_flow_control
        self.is_import = is_import
        self.is_yield = is_yield

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... (rest of the code)
```

By defining or importing the `Line` type and ensuring that the `@dataclass` decorator is accessible, the corrected version of the function should now work as intended.
