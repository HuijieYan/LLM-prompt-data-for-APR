The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the `newlines` and `is_decorator` variables are being incorrectly calculated and the returned values are  always 2 and 0 respectively. 

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements for `is_decorator` and `current_line.is_def` seem to be incorrect or incomplete, resulting in incorrect values for `newlines` and 'is_decorator'. 

To fix the bug, let's update the function by modifying the conditional statements to ensure that `newlines` and `is_decorator` are calculated accurately based on the given conditions.

The corrected version of the function would look as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 1  # Update the return value for is_decorator-related conditions

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `newlines` and `is_decorator` values are calculated based on the updated conditional statements. This ensures that the correct values are returned according to the given conditions.
