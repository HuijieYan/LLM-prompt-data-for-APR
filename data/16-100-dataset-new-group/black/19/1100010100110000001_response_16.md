The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not handling the empty lines correctly, which is causing the failing test to throw an assertion error. The function is trying to handle the insertion of empty lines based on various conditions, but it seems to be incorrectly calculating the number of empty lines to insert.

One of the potential error locations in the function is the conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines to be inserted. These conditional statements might not be handling all the possible cases correctly, leading to an incorrect number of empty lines being returned.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the function need to be carefully checked to ensure that they cover all the necessary cases and handle them correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    # Fixed the default return to return the correct number of empty lines
    return 0, 0
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that it returns the correct number of empty lines based on the conditions and handles all possible cases. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
