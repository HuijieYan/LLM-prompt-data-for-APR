The potential bug in the _maybe_empty_lines function is related to the handling of previous_defs and the calculation of empty lines. The first bug location is in the while loop where the code should apply the appropriate empty line logic based on the current depth. However, the loop is not properly adjusting the value of 'before' and 'depth' for each iteration. The second bug location is in the OR condition for checking the case when the previous line is an import. The third bug is in the final return statement where 'or' condition might not accurately determine the proper amount of empty lines to return.


To fix the _maybe_empty_lines function, the logic for adjusting 'before', 'depth', and the calculation of appropriate empty lines needs to be corrected. Additionally, the return condition for handling imports needs revising. To achieve this, the following corrected version is provided:

```python
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            if current_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth) or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```
