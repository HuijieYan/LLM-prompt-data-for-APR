The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic for handling empty lines and newlines is not properly implemented. It seems that the logic for calculating the number of newlines and empty lines before a line is incorrect, which is causing the failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to review the entire logic for calculating the number of newlines and empty lines before a line. The logic needs to be adjusted to correctly handle different scenarios such as the depth of the current line, whether it's a decorator, flow control, import, yield, etc.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling different cases such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields has been adjusted to correctly calculate the number of newlines and empty lines before the current line. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
