The cause of the bug seems to be in how the function `_maybe_empty_lines` handles empty lines before and after a given line. There are multiple conditional statements within the function that may not be functioning as intended, causing incorrect calculation of empty lines.

The buggy function is expected to return a Tuple of two integers, corresponding to the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, based on the provided values, the function is not returning the correct number of empty lines, leading to failed tests.

The main cause of bug could be the incorrect handling of `before` and `is_decorator` conditions. Additionally, the reassignment of the `before` variable within the while loop doesn't seem to be correctly expressing the intended logic.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve carefully reviewing the logic and conditional statements within the function. Ensuring that each condition is properly evaluated and executed, and it returns the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Here's a possible corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return 0, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield:
            return 1, 0
        
        return 0, 0
```

Please note that the above corrected function is a simplified version that may need to be further tailored based on the actual logic and requirements of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
