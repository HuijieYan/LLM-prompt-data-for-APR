The bug in the buggy function is causing incorrect behavior when it computes the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The incorrect outcome of the buggy function is leading to failing tests, as indicated by the error message. The key problem seems to be related to the computation of the number of required empty lines before and after the currently processed line. 

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the variables, it can be observed that the `is_decorator` variable is either being set incorrectly or is not being used in the correct context, leading to incorrect decisions being made for the number of empty lines around decorators. The `max_allowed` variable, which is supposedly used to set the maximum allowed empty lines, is also not being used effectively.

To fix this bug, the use of the `is_decorator` variable and the `max_allowed` variable should be carefully examined to ensure that they are being used correctly to make decisions about the required number of empty lines. Pay attention to where the `is_decorator` variable needs to be set and how this affects the maximum allowed empty lines.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues with setting the proper number of empty lines based on the presence of decorators and other types of lines, considering the `max_allowed` value.
