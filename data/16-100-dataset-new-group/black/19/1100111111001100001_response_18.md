The bug in the given function appears to be that the logic for determining the number of allowed empty lines is not working correctly. The numerical value of `max_allowed` is being set based on the `depth` property of the `current_line`, but the usage of `min` and considering the `depth` of `self.previous_defs` is causing inconsistencies in the output.

One strategy to fix the bug is to re-evaluate the logic for setting `max_allowed` and for updating `before` and `depth` based on the conditions and use cases provided. Additionally, a review should be conducted on how `self.previous_defs` and other related instances are updated and interacted with during the execution of the function. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

The corrected version includes improvements in the handling of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `depth` variables based on the provided use cases and input conditions. It also includes adjustments for the previous_defs list handling. This version should now accurately determine the number of allowed empty lines and provide the expected behavior for the given test cases.
