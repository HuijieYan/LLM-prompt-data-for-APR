The bug involves the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The buggy behavior is likely causing the test to fail, resulting in the AssertionError message shown.

The `_maybe_empty_lines` function has several potential error locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.leaves:` might be causing the issue by not handling the case where `current_line.leaves` is empty, resulting in an incorrect value assigned to `before`.
2. The assignments to `newlines` variable within the conditions seem to be incorrect and not handling all cases expected by the test.
3. The conditions involving `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `is_flow_control` might not be evaluating to the correct values based on the behavior expected by the failing test.

The potential cause of the bug is that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not setting the correct number of empty lines before and after specific types of lines, such as imports, decorators, and flow control statements. The incorrect assignments and conditions could be causing the returned values to be inconsistent with the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be reviewed and updated to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the type of line and its relationship with the previous line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if not current_line.leaves:  # Fixed handling of empty `leaves`
        before = 0
    else:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
        and not current_line.is_import(self)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
        and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the handling of empty `leaves`, the logic for calculating `before`, and the conditions involving `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `is_flow_control` have been updated to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the test expectations.
