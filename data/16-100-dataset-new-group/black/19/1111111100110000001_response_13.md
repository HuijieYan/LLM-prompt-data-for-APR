The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. The `if` condition: `if current_line.is_flow_control:` seems to be missing a `self` reference before `current_line`. 
2. The comparison between `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs` is unclear and might not be functioning as expected.

This bug is likely causing an issue where empty lines are not being handled correctly, leading to an incorrect formatting of the code. The failing test message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output, specifically related to the presence of empty lines in the code.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all references to attributes and methods within the class use the `self` keyword when accessed within the class. Additionally, the logic for handling empty lines and previous line comparisons should be reviewed and potentially revised.

Here's the corrected version of the `buggy` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = self._is_decorator(current_line)
        if is_decorator or self._is_def(current_line) or self._is_class(current_line):
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self._is_decorator(self.previous_line):
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if self._is_flow_control(current_line):
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self._is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not self._is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self._is_yield(self.previous_line)
            and (not self._is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, all methods checks are referred with `self` keyword.
