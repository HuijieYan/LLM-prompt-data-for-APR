The bug in the given function seems to be located in the logic that computes the number of potential empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. Additionally, it appears that there might be an issue with the preservation of indentation depth and previous definition tracking.

The failing test case seems to indicate that the empty lines are not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect formatting. This could be caused by the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Based on the provided runtime input/output variable values, it seems that the function is not correctly handling different scenarios associated with different line types (e.g., decorators, flow control, imports, etc.). Additionally, it looks like the handling of indentation depth and previous definition tracking might be causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, it's recommended to rewrite the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to implement a more structured approach for handling different line types and their corresponding rules for adding empty lines. It might be necessary to refactor this function to separate the logic for different line types into individual conditional branches and then address the uniqueness of each case.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        return self._maybe_empty_lines_based_on_line_type(current_line, max_allowed)

def _maybe_empty_lines_based_on_line_type(self, current_line: Line, max_allowed: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Handling the logic based on different line types
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return self._empty_lines_with_decorator_def_or_class(current_line, max_allowed)
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return self._empty_lines_with_flow_control(current_line, max_allowed)
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return self._empty_lines_with_imports(current_line, max_allowed)
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return self._empty_lines_with_yield(current_line, max_allowed)
    else:
        return self._empty_lines_default_behavior(current_line, max_allowed)

def _empty_lines_with_decorator_def_or_class(self, line: Line, max_allowed: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Handle logic for decorators, def, and class
    if not line.is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(line.depth)
    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    newlines = 2 - int(line.depth > 0)
    return newlines, 0

def _empty_lines_with_flow_control(self, line: Line, max_allowed: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Handle flow control lines
    return int(max_allowed or 1), 1

def _empty_lines_with_imports(self, line: Line, max_allowed: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Handle imports and subsequent lines
    return (int(max_allowed or 1)), 0

def _empty_lines_with_yield(self, line: Line, max_allowed: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Handle yields and subsequent lines with different depth
    return (int(max_allowed or 1), 0)

def _empty_lines_default_behavior(self, line: Line, max_allowed: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    if line.leaves:
        first_leaf = line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    return before, 0
```

It's important to note that the above function has been abstracted into helper methods for better organization and readability. The parameters and return types can be adjusted based on the actual implementation and requirements.

With the updated logic, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should return the correct number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, satisfying the failing test cases. The logic for handling different line types has been separated into individual methods to address each case uniquely, which should help avoid unexpected interactions and improve maintainability.
