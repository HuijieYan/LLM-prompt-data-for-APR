Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. There are multiple return statements that may not always return a value.
2. The logic for calculating the number of newlines before and after the currently processed line is complex and may not always be correct.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic for calculating the number of newlines before and after the currently processed line in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This can lead to incorrect formatting of the source code, causing the failing test to fail.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the logic for calculating the number of newlines before and after the currently processed line.
2. Ensure that there is a single return statement that always returns a value.
3. Test the function with a variety of input cases to verify the correctness of the new logic.

Fixed version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    # Check if the current line is a decorator, def, or class
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    # Check if the current line is flow control
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    # Check for other conditions
    else:
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return before or 1, 0
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return before or 1, 0
        return before, 0
```
In the fixed version, the logic for calculating the number of newlines has been simplified and the return statements have been organized to ensure that a value is always returned. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
