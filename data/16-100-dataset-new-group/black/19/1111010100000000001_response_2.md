The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class seems to stem from the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The logic involves various conditional checks based on the properties of the `current_line` object and the previous line.

Potential error locations within the function:
1. Inconsistent use of `if` conditions and assignment of values to the `max_allowed` variable in the first part of the function.
2. Misuse of the `before` variable in conditional checks and reassignments.
3. Inconsistent handling of the `depth` property and its comparison in different conditional blocks.

Cause of the bug:
The bug may be caused by conflicting conditional checks and inconsistent handling of variables like `max_allowed`, `before`, and `depth`. This inconsistency could lead to incorrect calculations of the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a consistent approach to set the value of `max_allowed` based on the value of `current_line.depth`.
2. Ensure proper handling and consistent use of the `before` variable in different conditional blocks.
3. Verify the conditions for checking the `depth` property and ensure they are used consistently and correctly.

Corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(bool(current_line.depth))
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```
