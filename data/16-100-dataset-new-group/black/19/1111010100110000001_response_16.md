The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it is not properly returning the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line as expected. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output, specifically related to the number of empty lines.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line, especially the conditions and calculations related to `before`, `newlines`, and return statements.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect calculations and conditions in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, leading to a mismatch in the number of empty lines before and after the current line when compared to the expected output in the test.

To fix the bug, the conditions for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line need to be carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the input `current_line`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # Check if the previous line exists and adjust newlines accordingly
    if self.previous_line:
        if (
            self.previous_line.is_decorator
            or self.previous_line.is_def
            or self.previous_line.is_class
        ):
            if current_line.depth:
                return 1, 1 if current_line.is_flow_control else 0
            return 2, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return 1, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return 1, 0

    # Handle cases where previous line does not exist or is not relevant
    if (
        current_line.is_decorator
        or current_line.is_def
        or current_line.is_class
    ):
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return 0, 0

    return 0, 0
```

After making these changes, the revised `_maybe_empty_lines` function should properly calculate the number of empty lines before and after the current line, ensuring that it aligns with the expected output in the test.
