The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function comes from the logic used to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The code has several conditional statements that have problematic logic for determining when to return values for empty lines. Upon analyzing the failing tests and the runtime values and types of variables inside the function (cases 1-8), it is clear that the function is not correctly handling various types of lines, such as decorators, yield statements, imports, and flow control.

The current logic does not appropriately handle the cases where certain conditions are met, resulting in incorrect values for `before` and `newlines`. This causes the function to improperly insert additional empty lines or not insert them when needed, leading to failing tests and inconsistencies.

To fix the bug, in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the conditional logic needs to be adjusted to correctly handle different line types and the presence of decorators, defs, classes, imports, and yield statements. This will involve carefully considering the conditions under which the function should return specific values for empty lines and ensuring that the logic accurately captures these cases.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that includes the necessary fixes to address the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```
This corrected version of the function should fix the bug and allow it to pass the failing test. The conditional logic has been improved to correctly handle cases such as decorators, defs, classes, imports, yield statements, and flow control.
