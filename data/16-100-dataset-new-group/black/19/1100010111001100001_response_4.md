The provided function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that need to be addressed to pass the failing test. The key potential error locations in the function are:

1. The conditional logic for calculating `max_allowed` is incorrect.
2. The logic for updating the `before` variable within the while loop is faulty.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the cases where `current_line` is a decorator or a def. It fails to properly calculate the number of newlines and returns incorrect values for `newlines` and `before` in certain cases, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the cases where `current_line` is a decorator or a def and ensure that the logic for updating `before` within the while loop is correct.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the cases of decorators and defs correctly and return the expected values when these conditions are met. The failing test should pass with this corrected version.
