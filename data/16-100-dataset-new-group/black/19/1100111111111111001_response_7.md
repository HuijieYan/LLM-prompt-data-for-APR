The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is primarily due to incorrect logic for determining the number of empty lines and indentation levels within the code. The incorrect implementation results in the failure of the test functions because the actual output of the function does not match the expected output.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Restructure the logic that calculates the number of empty lines based on the depth and conditions associated with the line of code.
2. Ensure that the logic accurately handles different types of code elements and their interaction, such as imports, decorators, flow control statements, etc.
3. Pay attention to the impact of previous line information on the calculation of newlines.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth != 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

        if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
The corrected function handles various scenarios including decorators, imports, flow control statements, etc. to ensure that the output of the function matches the expected values provided by the failing test cases.
