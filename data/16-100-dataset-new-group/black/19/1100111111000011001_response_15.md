The `append` function seems to be called within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, but since we don't have the `Leaf` and `Line` classes and their functions and properties, we can't fully debug the code. However, one potential issue can be identified - multiple `append` functions are defined with the same name.

The multiple definitions of the `append` function with different signatures may lead to confusion. The correct function may not be called as expected. This can result in incorrect values for the variables used in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, leading to unexpected output.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the correct `append` function is called with the intended parameters. This might involve renaming one or more of the `append` functions to avoid ambiguity. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the intended `Leaf` and `Line` classes are called with the correct parameters and properties.

Below is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the provided information:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Please note that without complete information about the `Leaf` and `Line` classes and their properties, this code is hypothetical and may need further adjustments based on the actual structure of those classes.
