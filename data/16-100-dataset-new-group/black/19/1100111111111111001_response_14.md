The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is likely caused by a logic error. The function is supposed to return the number of blank lines to be added before and after a line of code, depending on certain conditions. However, the function's logic does not accurately capture these conditions, leading to incorrect blank lines being added. The function seems overly complex, and it might be more efficient to break it down into smaller, more manageable functions, which could also make debugging and testing easier.

Here is a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Debug the function by inspecting the conditional statements that determine the number of blank lines to be returned.
2. Identify each condition specifically and ensure that it is accurately capturing the intended logic.
3. Simplify the function by breaking it down into smaller, more modular functions, such as separate functions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, etc.
4. Test the function with different input scenarios to ensure that the expected number of blank lines is returned under different conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from collections import namedtuple
Leaf = namedtuple('Leaf', ['type', 'value'])
Line = namedtuple('Line', ['depth', 'leaves', 'comments', 'bracket_tracker', 'inside_brackets', 'is_decorator', 'is_def', 'is_class', 'is_flow_control', 'is_import', 'is_yield'])
EmptyLineTracker = namedtuple('EmptyLineTracker', ['previous_line', 'previous_after', 'previous_defs'])

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return _handle_decorator_def_class(current_line, self.previous_defs, self.previous_line)

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0

def _handle_decorator_def_class(current_line, previous_defs, previous_line):
    if not current_line.is_decorator:
        previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
    if previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0
    if previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    return newlines, 0
```

This refactored version creates a helper function `_handle_decorator_def_class` to handle the logic for decorators, def, and class cases. This helps to simplify the main function and make the logic clearer.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. However, it might need to be further tested with additional scenarios to ensure its correctness.
