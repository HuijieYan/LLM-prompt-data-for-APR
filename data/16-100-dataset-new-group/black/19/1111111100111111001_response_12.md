The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the way that the various conditionals are being set up, causing the function to not return the expected number of empty lines.

#### Bug in the provided function:
The primary issue with the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be that the conditionals are not correctly handling the cases for `is_decorator`, `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `previous_defs` which may cause the function to return incorrect values for `newlines` and `before`.

Generally, the flow of the conditionals should be revisited and the correct condition checks should be put in place to ensure that all cases are handled properly and yield the expected results.

#### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the existing conditional statements in `_maybe_empty_lines` and ensure that they cover all possible scenarios comprehensively.
2. Update the conditional statements to correctly handle the different cases of `is_decorator`, `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `previous_defs` to yield the expected results.
3. Ensure that the proper configurations are present for setting `newlines` and `before` depending on the conditions.

#### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the extra newlines of the first leaf's prefix
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - int(bool(current_line.depth))
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```
The corrected function revises the conditional flow to ensure that all cases are properly handled and the expected values of `newlines` and `before` are returned. It also adds logic to ensure that the conditions are properly checked and the `max_allowed` variable is calculated correctly.
