The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This function is used to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The potential error locations within the function could be caused by the conditions and comparison statements that might not be working as intended, leading to incorrect calculations of the number of empty lines needed.

The cause of the bug may be due to incorrect handling of conditions related to checking for decorators, imports, and other line types, resulting in wrong calculations of the number of empty lines needed.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to review and re-implement the conditions and comparison statements within the function related to checking for decorators, imports, and other line types. Additionally, ensuring the correct handling of depth and checking for previous lines is essential for the correct calculation of empty lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    # Correct handling of previous_defs
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        # Correct  before value calculation
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    # Replaced self.previous_line with current_line
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == current_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != current_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the statements related to handling previous definitions, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields have been reviewed and modified to ensure the correct calculation of empty lines. Additionally, the usage of `current_line` has been corrected where it was erroneously using `self.previous_line`.
