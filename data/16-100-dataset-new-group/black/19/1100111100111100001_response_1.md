The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before the current line. The logic checks for various conditions based on the current line `depth` and whether it is a decorator, def, class, or flow control. In some cases, it relies on the `self.previous_line` to make decisions.

Based on the failing test cases and their corresponding runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue could be related to the computation of the `before` variable, which determines the number of newlines to insert before the current line.

One potential issue is with the logic for updating the `before` variable within the code. In the case where there are no leaves in the current line, the `before` variable is set to 0. However, this could be incorrect; it might need more in-depth condition checks based on the syntax and structure of the code. 

Another potential issue could be the handling of the `self.previous_line`. The logic related to the checking of various properties of the previous line and the current line could be incorrect, leading to incorrect computations of the return values.

To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, a strategy could be to carefully review the logic for computing the `before` and `newlines` variables and test various scenarios to ensure that the computations are correct. Additionally, reviewing the conditions that rely on `self.previous_line` would be critical to understand and address any incorrect assumptions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the suggested strategy:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    newlines = 0
    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, newlines

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, newlines

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, newlines

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version, the computation of `before` and `newlines` has been revised, and the conditions that rely on `self.previous_line` have been reviewed to ensure that they result in correct computations.
