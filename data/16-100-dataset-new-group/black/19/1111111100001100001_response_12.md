The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the incorrect behavior of calculating the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The main cause of the bug appears to be in the erroneous logic for updating the `before` and `depth` variables and determining the number of empty lines needed.

After analyzing the function and its relationship with the buggy class and related functions, it is clear that the cause of the bug lies in the inconsistent use of the `before` and `depth` variables in updating and determining the number of empty lines. The incorrect initialization and use of these variables lead to incorrect calculations and produce unexpected results when the function returns.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic for updating the `before` and `depth` variables based on the conditions specified in the function. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on various conditions should be carefully reviewed and modified if necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if any([current_line.is_decorator, current_line.is_def, current_line.is_class]):
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and
            self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and
            self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

The corrected version of the function ensures that the variables `before` and `depth` are updated and used consistently according to the specified conditions. The modified logic for the calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the current line is reviewed and adjusted to fix the bug.
