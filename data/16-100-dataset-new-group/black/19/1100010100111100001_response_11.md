Based on the provided error message and runtime input/output variable values, it seems that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is incorrectly handling the insertion of empty lines before certain lines of code. It appears that the bug may be related to the logic that calculates the number of empty lines to insert at a specific location in the code.

The overall strategy to fix the bug would involve reviewing and correcting the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be inserted before specific lines of code, taking into account the context of the current line, its characteristics, and the behavior conditional statements.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditional statements have been adjusted to ensure their logical correctness. Additionally, certain conditional checks have been refined to handle specific cases more accurately.

By making these adjustments, the corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now properly handle the insertion of empty lines before specific lines of code, addressing the previously observed failing tests.
