The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears to be part of a class called `EmptyLineTracker`, which is a stateful method that returns the number of extra empty lines required before and after the currently processed line.

The bug in the function seems to stem from incorrect calculation and conditions, leading to unexpected return values in certain cases.

The potential errors can be identified from the incorrect handling of the `max_allowed` value, misleading conditions, and incorrect logic for setting the number of newlines.

The main cause of the bug is the incorrect and inconsistent handling of newlines and conditions that should trigger different numbers of newlines.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the logic for determining the number of newlines before and after the current line based on the conditions provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    newlines_before = 0
    newlines_after = 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield):
        newlines_after = 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        newlines_before = 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        newlines_before = 1

    return min(newlines_before, max_allowed), newlines_after
```

In this corrected version, the function refactors the logic based on the specified conditions and handles the number of newlines before and after the current line accordingly. Additionally, clean-up of unnecessary checks and reorganization of the if-else conditions were performed to ensure correct behavior.
