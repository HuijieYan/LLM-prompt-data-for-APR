From the analysis, the issue lies within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The issue may result in inaccurate newlines and before values. The newlines should be calculated based on the depth and current line properties such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, etc.

The issue is highlighted by the fact that the expected values for `max_allowed`, `first_leaf`, `before`, and `is_decorator` are different from the observed values. The newlines should be dependent on these values.

To resolve the issue, the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be reviewed and revised to account for the conditions and properties of the `current_line`.

Based on the provided information and expected input/output values, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 0), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 0), 0

    return 0, 0
```
