Looking at the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, it appears that the logic inside the function is not functioning correctly. The conditional statements and assignments are not properly handling the different cases, leading to unexpected behavior. The negative unit tests are failing, indicating that the function is not returning the expected results.

The potential issues in the function include:
1. Incorrect handling of `before` variable
2. Incorrect handling of `depth` variable
3. Incorrect logic and conditional statements in returning `newlines` and `0`
4. Inconsistency in handling different boolean flags like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and so on.

To fix the bug, we should refactor the function to update the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` variables based on the conditions specified in the requirements.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
          
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions are properly handled to return the expected results.

Please test the function with various inputs and assertions to ensure its correctness.
