The issue with the function `_maybe_empty_lines` lies in the return statements, as they are not returning the expected values for each case. It seems that the conditions for deciding the number of newlines and the number before are not being met.

To fix the bug, we should review the conditions for each return statement to make sure that they correctly reflect the logic of the function. Additionally, debug statements or print statements can be added to the function to verify the values of `before`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the return statements have been modified to address the expected return values for each specific case. Additionally, the conditions have been revisited for accuracy.
