The buggy function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class, `_maybe_empty_lines`, appears to have issues that need to be addressed to ensure proper functionality. Based on the provided test case and the given runtime input/output values, it is observed that the problematic areas relate to the conditional handling of `current_line` attributes and the updates to `max_allowed`, `before`, `first_leaf.prefix`, `depth`, and `is_decorator` variables.

The buggy function is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed `current_line`. However, the conditional statements and updates within the function lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect outputs for certain cases.

Looking at the cases and their corresponding outputs, it can be inferred that the following strategy could resolve the issues:
- There's a need to reevaluate the conditional checks and updates in the `if` and `while` blocks to ensure that the values `max_allowed`, `before`, `first_leaf.prefix`, `depth`, and `is_decorator` are correctly adjusted based on the attributes of the `current_line`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class, taking into account the suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    # Restore previous_defs from the input value and make modifications based on conditions
    previous_defs = self.previous_defs[:]
    while previous_defs and previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    is_import = self.previous_line.is_import if self.previous_line else False
    if is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    is_yield = self.previous_line.is_yield if self.previous_line else False
    if is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function addresses the conditional checks and updates to ensure that the values `max_allowed`, `before`, `first_leaf.prefix`, `depth`, and `is_decorator` are adjusted accurately based on the attributes of the `current_line`. This should resolve the issues and make the function provide the correct output for the given test cases.
