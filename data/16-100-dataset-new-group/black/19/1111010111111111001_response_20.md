The bug is likely causing the failure of the `test_comment_in_decorator` test in the `black` module. In each case, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears not to be producing the expected output. The difference in the returned values and the expected values can be attributed to the assignment of `before`.

I suggest setting the `before` value for the base case to `min(before, max_allowed)`. This way, the function approaches the ADD and REMOVE rules properly. Additionally, when a decorator is hit, the lines of the current and previous line would equal 1, eliminating one of the issues raised in the test failure.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines` based on the suggested fix:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = min(1, before)
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected implementation of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now produce the expected output, passing the failing test.
