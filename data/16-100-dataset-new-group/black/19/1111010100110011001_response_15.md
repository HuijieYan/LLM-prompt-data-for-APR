To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method, let's address the known issues. It seems that the method is not consistently returning the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function logic needs to be adjusted to properly account for different conditions.

The primary issues that need to be fixed in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method are:
1. Inconsistent handling of `max_allowed` based on `current_line.depth`.
2. Inconsistent handling of `newlines` when `is_decorator` is True.

To address these issues, the following steps can be taken:
1. Update the logic to consistently use `max_allowed` where necessary, based on the value of `current_line.depth`.
2. Ensure that the correct number of empty lines are returned based on the various conditions within the function.

Given the above considerations, here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        empty_lines_before = 1 if depth else 2
        if depth:
            empty_lines_before -= 1
        return empty_lines_before, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected function should now appropriately handle the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line under various conditions. It should satisfy the expected input/output values as outlined in the given test cases.
