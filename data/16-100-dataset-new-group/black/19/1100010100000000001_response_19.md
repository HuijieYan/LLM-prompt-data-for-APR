## Potential Errors:
1. The `depth` variable is not initialized, which might cause a NameError.
2. In the while loop, the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` might not produce the intended result.
3. There are multiple return statements within conditional blocks, which might not cover all cases.
4. The use of `self` indicates that this function is part of a class, so `self` should be explicitly defined as the first argument of the function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug may cause unexpected behavior in the calculation of newlines and depth in the context of the provided code. Additionally, the use of `self` indicates that this function is intended for use within a class, but without an explicit `self` parameter, it may not function as expected.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `depth` variable is initialized before being used.
2. Improve the logic inside the while loop for calculating the `before` value.
3. Consolidate the return statements and cover all possible cases with the correct calculation and handling of `newlines`, `before`, and `depth`.
4. Define `self` as the first parameter in the function to indicate the usage within a class.
