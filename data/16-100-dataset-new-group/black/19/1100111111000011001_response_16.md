The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for adding empty lines before different types of code elements. The function is supposed to return the number of empty lines to be added before the current line, but it fails to do so correctly. 

1. The logic for adding empty lines before decorators, defs, classes, and import lines is incorrect.
2. The logic for counting the number of empty lines before the first leaf of the current line is incorrect and inconsistent.
3. The conditions for handling flow control and yield lines are not properly defined.

To fix the bug, we need to rewrite the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly handle the scenarios for adding empty lines before different types of code elements.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = max(min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed), 0)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before or 1, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before or 1, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` function now properly handles the scenarios for adding empty lines before different types of code elements, and it should satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
