Based on the analysis, the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly setting the values for `is_decorator` and `max_allowed` based on the conditions provided in the function. It also has a logic issue with the `previous_defs` list, which is not being updated as intended. 

The bug in the code is causing incorrect values for `is_decorator` and `max_allowed`, which are resulting in unexpected behavior for the function. To fix this bug, we need to update the code to correctly set these variables based on the conditions provided. Additionally, we need to fix the logic for updating the `previous_defs` list.

Based on the expected values and types provided, a corrected version of the buggy function is as follows:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    if self.is_decorator(current_line) or self.is_def(current_line) or self.is_class(current_line):
        if not self.is_decorator(current_line):
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.is_decorator(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if self.is_flow_control(current_line):
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not self.is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not self.is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
This corrected version of the function ensures that `is_decorator`, `max_allowed`, and `previous_defs` are updated correctly based on the conditions provided.
