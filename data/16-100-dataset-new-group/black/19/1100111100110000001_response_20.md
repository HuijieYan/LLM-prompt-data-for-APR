The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to code formatting, specifically handling the insertion of empty lines in a Python source file. The error message indicates that the formatting is not matching the expected output.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the logic that determines when to insert empty lines before specific types of code constructs such as decorators, imports, and flow control statements.

The cause of the bug could be related to the conditions that determine when to insert empty lines. It seems that the conditions for inserting or not inserting empty lines are not correctly set, leading to formatting differences between the expected and actual outputs.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review each condition in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that they are correctly evaluating the context of the current line and the previous line to determine the appropriate number of empty lines to insert.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        return 2 - current_line.depth, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic within the function has been reviewed, and the conditions and calculations for inserting empty lines have been adjusted to ensure that the formatting matches the expected output. This version should pass the failing test.
