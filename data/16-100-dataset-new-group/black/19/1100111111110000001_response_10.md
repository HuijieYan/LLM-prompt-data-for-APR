In the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, there are a few potential error locations that could be causing the test failure. 

1. The lines `self.previous_defs.pop()` and `self.previous_defs.append(depth)` might be problematic, as these lines potentially lead to incorrect behavior on subsequent calls to `_maybe_empty_lines`.
2. The logic for handling decorators is suspect. The check for `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` seems ambiguous and might not accurately represent the intended logic.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected output doesn't match the actual output, leading to an `AssertionError` in the `assertFormatEqual` function.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic around the `self.previous_defs` handling and the decorator logic. Additionally, it might be helpful to verify that the `before` and `depth` values are being computed correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 
In this corrected version, I have modified the handling of `self.previous_defs` and the logic for decorators. The `self.previous_defs.append(depth)` line is now executed directly after the `while` loop, and the conditions for checking decorators, definitions, and classes are simplified. Additionally, I've added `max` function in the return statement to ensure that the appropriate value is returned.
