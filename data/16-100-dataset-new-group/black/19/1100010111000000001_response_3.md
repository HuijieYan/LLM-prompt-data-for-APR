The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several potential error locations:
1. In the first if condition, `if current_line.depth == 0`, it should be checked whether `depth` is equal to 0 instead of `current_line.depth`.
2. The logic within the while loop where `before` is being assigned may cause potential issues.

The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of empty lines and indentation levels. Specifically, the handling of the `before` variable and the conditions for inserting empty lines seems to be erroneous.

To fix the bug, we should rethink the logic for adding empty lines. Specifically, we should pay attention to how `before` is calculated and used throughout the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if self.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `before` variable is computed using `min` and used in the return statements appropriately. Additionally, the condition for checking `depth` has been modified to use `self.depth` instead of `current_line.depth` in the first `if` condition.
