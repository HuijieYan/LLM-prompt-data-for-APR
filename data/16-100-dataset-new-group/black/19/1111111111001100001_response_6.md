The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to incorrect handling of `before` and `depth` values, leading to incorrect calculations and inconsistencies in retaining the previous line information. The function is also not handling certain cases correctly, such as decorators, imports, flow control, and yields.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the `before` value is correctly calculated based on the conditions and that the previous line information is appropriately retained. Additionally, proper handling for the other cases like decorators, imports, flow control, and yields should be added for correct logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_class or self.previous_line.is_def):
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `before` value is appropriately calculated, and the conditions for handling previous line information are updated. Additionally, proper handling for different case scenarios is added to ensure correct logic flow.
