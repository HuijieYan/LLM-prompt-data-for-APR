The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it incorrectly calculates the number of spaces needed before and after the currently processed line. The function has several conditional statements that are not properly handling the logic for different conditions and thus producing incorrect results.

One potential cause of the bug is with the conditional statements that check for `is_decorator` and `is_flow_control`, and the condition when `self.previous_line` is None. These conditions are not handling the cases correctly, resulting in incorrect outcomes.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements and logic need to be reviewed and re-implemented properly to handle the different scenarios and conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this fixed version, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now produce the correct number of spaces needed before and after the currently processed line, satisfying all the expected input/output cases.
