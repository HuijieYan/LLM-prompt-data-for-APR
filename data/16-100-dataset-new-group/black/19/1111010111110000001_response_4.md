The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class seems to be related to the calculation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The error message from the failing test suggests that the function is not correctly handling empty lines and comments within decorators.

The function first sets `max_allowed` to 1, but then updates it to 2 if `current_line.depth` is 0. This seems to be handling the number of empty lines that are allowed before and after the line based on the indentation level.

The function then checks various conditions related to decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to determine the number of empty lines before and after the line. It seems that the handling of these conditions may not be accurate, leading to the incorrect output and the failing test.

To fix the bug, the conditions related to decorators, flow control, imports, and yields need to be carefully reviewed to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the input `current_line`. Additionally, any modifications made to `current_line` should be carefully handled to avoid corrupting the original input.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        before = 0
        after = 0
        
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
        
        # Handle decorators
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                before = 0
            else:
                before = 1
        
        # Handle flow control
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            before = 0
            after = 1
        
        # Handle imports and yields
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
            if not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                before = 1
            elif not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
                before = 1
        
        return before, after
``` 

This corrected version of the function should handle decorators, flow control, imports, and yields properly, and return the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line, resolving the bug.
