The bug in the function _maybe_empty_lines of the EmptyLineTracker class is likely caused by the improper handling of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The variable `max_allowed` is being altered based on the condition `if current_line.depth == 0`, but in some cases, it is overwritten. Additionally, the assignment of `before` in the while loop and the variable `newlines` for specific cases could have issues.

To fix the bug, we will make the following changes:
1. Ensure that `max_allowed` is correctly handled and updated based on conditions.
2. Ensure that the assignment of `before` in the while loop is updated with considerations to the current and previous states.
3. Update the `newlines` variable to properly handle the newlines count based on specific cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    for depth in self.previous_defs:
        if depth >= current_line.depth:
            before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if (is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class):
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and 
        current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or 
        current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

These changes address the improper handling of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines`, ensuring that the function calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line accurately.
