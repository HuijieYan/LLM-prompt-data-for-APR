## Analysis
The `assertFormatEqual` test is failing, indicating that the `fs` function is not formatting the code correctly. This suggests that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which is called by the `fs` function, is not handling empty lines and indents properly.

## Bug
The bug seems to be related to how the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is handling empty lines, indents, and decorators. This is causing the incorrect formatting of the code.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check the logic for handling empty lines, indents, and decorators in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
2. Ensure that the conditions for inserting empty lines, based on different scenarios, are correctly implemented.
3. Make sure that the handling of `before` and `newlines` variables is appropriate for each scenario.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    depth = current_line.depth
    before = 0

    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that the conditions for handling empty lines, based on different scenarios, are appropriately implemented. The handling of `before` and `newlines` variables has been updated to address the inconsistencies and improve the overall logic of the function.
