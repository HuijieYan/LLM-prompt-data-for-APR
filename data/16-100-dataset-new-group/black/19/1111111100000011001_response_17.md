Based on the provided code and the expected input/output values, it seems that the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function might be related to incorrect variable assignments and conditions. The function is expected to return the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The potential cause of the bug could be related to the following issues:
1. Incorrect conditional checks on `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, `current_line.is_class`, `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, and `current_line.is_yield`.
2. Incorrect usage of `max_allowed` and `before` variables, leading to the wrong expected values.

To fix this bug, the conditional checks should be adjusted to correctly handle the different cases defined in the expected input/output values. Additionally, the correct values of `max_allowed` and `before` should be set based on the specific conditions in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        # handle decorator, def, and class cases
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    # handle import and yield cases
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should satisfy all the expected input/output values provided. It handles the conditional checks and variable assignments based on the specific cases defined in the expected cases.
