The bug is causing an AssertionError in a test case because the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly computing the number of empty lines to insert before and after a line in certain conditions. The bug probably lies within the conditional statements that should handle different scenarios to correctly assign the values to the `before` and `newlines` variables.

Based on the runtime values and types of variables provided in the failing test cases, specifically focusing on the inputs and the variables right before the return statement of the function, it seems that the issue lies in the conditional checks for `is_import` and `is_yield` properties of the `current_line` and `previous_line` objects. These checks seem to be incorrectly deciding how many empty lines to insert. 

To fix the bug, I would suggest thoroughly reviewing the conditional logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensuring that the correct checks are made to take into account all the different scenarios for how many empty lines should be inserted before and after a line. Additionally, considering the conditional logics for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, and `is_flow_control` would also be beneficial.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the analysis:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if len(current_line.leaves) > 0:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In this corrected version, I have ensured that proper conditional logic is implemented to correctly compute the number of empty lines to insert before and after a line based on the given input values and expected behavior. This should address the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
