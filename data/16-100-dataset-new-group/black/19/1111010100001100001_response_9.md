The `maybe_empty_lines` function has several issues:

1. The `maybe_empty_lines` function is trying to modify the `prefix` of the `first_leaf` by setting it to an empty string, but this manipulation does not persist beyond the function scope. This suggests that the function is not effectively modifying the object it is supposed to.

2. There are discrepancies in the expected output right before the return of the function. For example, the `max_allowed` value in the first return case should be 2, but it's not being utilized correctly in the cases with `is_decorator` condition.

3. It seems that the logic for determining empty lines before and after the current line is incorrect since it is producing unexpected results.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve:
- Verifying that the `prefix` change for the `first_leaf` is actually being reflected in the `Line` object by looking at how `Leaves` are structured within the `Line` class.
- Re-evaluating the logic for determining empty lines before and after the current line, verifying if the current conditions for `is_decorator` and empty lines are correct.

Based on the issues, the following is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if not self.previous_line:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and 
        current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I have adjusted the logic to handle the computation of `before` and the handling of cases with `is_decorator`. I also removed some redundant checks like `self.previous_line and` since it's already covered within the first check for `self.previous_line`. Additionally, I have modified the logic to correctly append `current_line.depth` to `self.previous_defs` in the case of `is_decorator` or other conditions.
