The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions and logic for determining the number of newlines to return. There are multiple if-else conditions checking for different scenarios to determine the number of newlines, and it's likely that the logic within these conditions is causing unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the conditions and logic for determining the number of newlines to return are not correctly handling all the cases and scenarios as intended.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to thoroughly review each condition and logic for determining the number of newlines, ensuring that all possible scenarios are covered and that the logic is correctly implemented.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, some minor modifications were made to the conditions under is_decorator, and is_import, and is_yield. Additionally, there were updates to the logic for returning the number of newlines to ensure that all scenarios are correctly handled.
