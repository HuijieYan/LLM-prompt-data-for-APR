The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is causing the failing tests. After analyzing the input, output, and expected values we can see that there are different if-else conditions detected. The return statement of the function is already using these conditions, but there are some issues. 

The expected values show us that the problem could be the inconsistent use of the `if-else` statements to determine the required newline count. Specifically, for case 3, the newlines expected value is 2, but the function is not returning it. Additionally, the maximum number of allowed newlines for specific cases is stated but the function might be returning improper amounts.

To fix the problem, a new approach is to be used in creating the required newline count. The correct strategy would involve properly checking and defining the newline count according to the specific conditions determined at each corresponding point in the function.

Given these analysis results, a corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = max(2 - (1 if current_line.depth else 0), 0)
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    if (self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    return before, 0
```
This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values.
