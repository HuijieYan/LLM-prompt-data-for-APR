The given buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, which has not been properly imported and defined in the code snippet provided. Since the error message describes an assertion failure, it indicates that the function is not producing the expected output.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The logic involving the conditions for different types of lines, such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields, as well as the manipulation of `before` and `newlines` variables, could be causing the bug.

The bug seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output. The specific error message indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual formatting of the input source, suggesting that the logic for inserting empty lines is incorrect and needs fixing.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review and update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before and after the currently processed line based on the context and type of the line.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line has been adjusted based on the context and type of the line. This should address the bug and ensure that the function produces the correct output.
