The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the class `EmptyLineTracker` and is intended to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. 

Looking at the error message, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, resulting in a formatting difference that causes the test to fail.

The potential error locations in the function could be the conditional statements and the logic for calculating the number of empty lines based on various line properties.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function calculates the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. Certain conditions and calculations within the function might not be correctly handling the prefix, depth, and other properties of the current line, leading to incorrect computation of empty lines.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic for calculating the number of empty lines based on the current line properties and the relationship with the previous line. This may involve adjusting the conditional statements and computation logic to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is determined according to the defined rules.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the computation of `before` and the handling of various conditions have been adjusted to ensure the correct calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This should address the formatting difference and resolve the failing test.
