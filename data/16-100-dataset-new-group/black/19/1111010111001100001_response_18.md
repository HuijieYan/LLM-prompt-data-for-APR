The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be unable to correctly compute the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The issues might arise due to incorrect conditions for determining `max_allowed` value and complications in setting `before` value. The logic of setting `is_decorator` is also suspect.

Looking at the cases and the respective output values, it seems that the `before` value is not being assigned appropriately. The current control flow of the function may not be covering all the necessary conditions to correctly determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. 

A strategy for fixing the bug could include revisiting the conditions for setting `before` and `max_allowed`. Additionally, the control flow for setting `is_decorator` needs to be revised to ensure that the correct value is being assigned based on the input line characteristics. The condition check for `depth` also needs to be reviewed to correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed.

Given these insights, we can provide a corrected version of the buggy function below:
```python
# Modified and corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
