The issue with the buggy function seems to be within the logic for updating `before` in the `while` loop, along with the logic for updating `newlines`. Additionally, the conditions for returning the correct values at the end of the function need to be re-examined.

The `before` and `newlines` update logic seems to be overwriting each other's values, and also there are multiple conditions for returning different values which might lead to conflicts.

To fix the bug, the if-else conditions and the variables `before` and `newlines` should be handled more systematically and independently.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        else:
            return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
