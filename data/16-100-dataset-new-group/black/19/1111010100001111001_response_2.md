The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that are causing it to not return the expected output. 
The primary issue is with the logic of modifying the `before` variable. The `before` variable is being reset to 1 or 2 based on different conditions, which is incorrect as it should track the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

Another issue is with the computation of `newlines` when the `is_decorator` condition is `True`. The logic for number of newlines based on `depth` is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

Lastly, the logic related to `self.previous_defs` seems to be incorrect, as it's popping the previous definitions and updating `before` inappropriately.

The function should also return the correct tuples `(before, newlines)` instead of different values based on different conditions.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made:
1. Correct the logic for updating the `before` variable to accurately track the number of potential extra empty lines.
2. Update the computation of `newlines` based on the correct conditions.
3. Ensure that the correct tuple `(before, newlines)` is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Update before based on previous_defs
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 2 if depth else 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return 0, newlines

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

These changes address the incorrect logic and ensure that the function returns the correct tuple `(before, newlines)` based on the input parameters.
