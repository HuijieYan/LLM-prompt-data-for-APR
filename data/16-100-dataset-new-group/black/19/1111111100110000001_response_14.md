The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the function. The failing test is related to a case involving comments within a decorator. The test is failing because the actual output contains fewer empty lines than the expected output in the comments section.

Upon analyzing the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class, the potential error locations are identified as follows:
1. The logic for inserting and counting empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
2. The conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, especially when encountering decorators and importing statements. The incorrect handling of these conditions results in the wrong number of empty lines being inserted, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the logic for inserting empty lines before and after the currently processed line needs to be revised, and the conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields need to be carefully reviewed and adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        after = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        return before, after
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version:
- The conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the currently processed line have been handled properly.
- The conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields have been adjusted to ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the given scenario.
- The logic is simplified to improve readability and maintainability.

After these corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should pass the failing test.
