The bug appears to be in the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The goal of the function is to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The issue seems to be with the conditions and comparisons within the function. In particular, the conditions for checking `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` need to be carefully evaluated. Additionally, the settings and checks for `before` and `newlines` may also have some potential errors.

The bug is likely causing incorrect values to be returned for the potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to carefully reevaluate the conditions within the function and ensure that the correct logic is applied to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed. It might also involve reviewing and modifying the logic surrounding the `before` and `newlines` variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function with a few changes:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: list
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
        
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2 - (1 if current_line.depth else 0)
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0
        
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return max(before, 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic concerning the conditions for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, `is_yield` has been adjusted. The comparisons for `before` and `newlines` have also been modified to ensure correct values are returned for the potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
