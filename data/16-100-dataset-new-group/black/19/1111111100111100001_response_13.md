# Plan
The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely caused by incorrect logic related to adding and removing values from the `self.previous_defs` list.

The function `_maybe_empty_lines` should correctly determine the number of empty lines to add before and after the currently processed line. It is expected to handle various conditions to determine the need for empty lines based on specific types of code constructs.

Based on the error message and the runtime input/output values, it's evident that the function is not correctly handling the presence of decorators, newlines, and previous line conditions.

To fix this issue, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Review the conditions and logic related to handling decorators, previous line checks, and newlines.
2. Ensure that the `self.previous_defs` list is managed correctly based on the context and depth level of the current line.
3. Update the logic to determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the code constructs.

Revised `*_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth <= len(self.previous_defs):
        self.previous_defs = self.previous_defs[:depth]
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This function should correctly handle various conditions and ensure the `self.previous_defs` list is managed based on the depth of the current line.

After applying these changes, the function should pass the failing tests and provide the expected correct behavior. If there are additional failing tests, further adjustments may be necessary based on the specific use cases.
