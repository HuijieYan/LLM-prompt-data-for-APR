To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, I will analyze the code to identify potential error locations and understand the cause of the bug. 

In the provided `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we can see that there are multiple conditional statements and logic checks implemented within the function. The bug could potentially lie within these conditional statements, specifically in the logic that assigns the value of `max_allowed` and the conditional checks related to checking `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` properties of the `current_line` object. 

After analyzing the failing test, it is evident that the expected values of certain variables are not matching the actual values at the time of verifying the function. The faulty conditional checks and assignments could be the reason behind this discrepancy.

A strategy to fix the bug would involve reviewing and correcting the conditional statements to ensure they are evaluating the conditions and assigning values correctly based on the expected behavior. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the behavior of the `current_line` object and its properties to ensure they are being checked and handled appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 - current_line.depth
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I have updated the conditional statements based on the analysis to ensure that they correctly evaluate the conditions and perform the expected behavior. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test case.
