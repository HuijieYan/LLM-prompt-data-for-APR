The buggy function seems to be producing incorrect values for its variables, based on failed test case execution.

1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes as input a `Line` object that has attributes `depth`, `leaves`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`, all of which are used to make decisions within the function.
2. The function also references the variables `previous_defs` and `previous_line` from the `self` parameter. These variables are used to keep track of previously seen lines in the context of indentation.

### Issues
1. The expected values and the actual values of the variables right before the buggy function's return don't match. The `newlines` value does not seem to be correctly calculated and does not match the expected output.
2. The conditions of the `if` statements towards the end of the function are not being processed correctly, resulting in incorrect return values.

### Bug Fixes
1. After analyzing the function and its inputs/outputs, it seems that the conditions in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` need to be revisited and refactored to produce the expected results.
2. The variables `is_decorator`, `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `previous_defs` are not being handled properly, leading to divergence from the expected output. These need to be properly considered and controlled when deciding the value of `newlines`.

### Updated function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This revised function takes into account the checks for `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`, while also considering the `previous_defs` to control the logic for inserting newlines.

With these changes, the function should produce the expected output values and pass the failing test cases.
