The issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it returns an unexpected `newlines` value when the function is a decorator, is a class, or is a def.

This occurs because during the set of different if-else scenarios, the function returns `newlines` with 2 newlines but does not consider the possibility of returning 1 or no newline especially when the function is a decorator, class, or def.

To fix this issue, one potential strategy would be to explicitly set `newlines` to 0 or 1 in those cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines if newlines >= 0 else 0, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version above, in the case when the function is a decorator, class, or def, it sets `newlines` to 2 and then returns it if it is positive, else it returns 0.
This corrected function now should pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output values as mentioned above.

Please test this corrected version with the failing test to verify the fix.
