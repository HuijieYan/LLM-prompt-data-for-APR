Based on the analysis of the code and the failing test cases, it seems that there is a recognition that the function should be handling different cases based on the type of the current line. My suggestion for fixing the bug is to reevaluate the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and adjust it to appropriately handle the different types of lines being processed. 

It's also worth noting that there are several methods specified for different types of lines such as `is_decorator`, `is_import`, `is_def`, `is_class`, etc. which are not being used within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. It's possible that these methods are intended to be used to determine the characteristics of the lines being processed and should therefore be integrated into the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before += min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before += 1 if depth == 0 else 2
            
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines = 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        newlines = before or 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        newlines = before or 1

    return before, newlines
```

In this corrected version, we've adjusted the conditional logic and integrated the information about different line types to handle the different scenarios more effectively. We've also taken into account the significance of the previous line to determine the number of newlines to be inserted. The code now accounts for different line types and should work correctly to pass the failing test cases.
