The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. It is not handling some cases correctly.

In the first case, the input line is a decorator, and the `max_allowed` value is set correctly based on the depth of the current line. However, the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert does not match the expected behavior.

In the second case, a similar issue occurs, showing that the current line is not correctly classified as a decorator.

In the third case, the identified issue happens again despite the current line being identified as a decorator.

In the fourth and fifth cases, it is identified that the current line is not being correctly classified as a decorator or non-decorator as well.

In the sixth case, the issue with the current line's classification persists.

In the seventh case, it is identified that the update to `self.previous_defs` might not be happening optimally.

In the eighth case, it is noted that the `max_allowed` value is handled correctly, but the number of newlines is not being calculated as expected due to an incorrect classification of the current line.

To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the classification logic for the current line needs to be corrected, and the indentation-related handling of the newlines should be revisited to ensure the correct number of newlines is returned.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version revises the classification of the current line by using the `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` attributes directly. Additionally, the logic for handling newlines is updated to ensure the correct number of newlines is returned for different scenarios.
