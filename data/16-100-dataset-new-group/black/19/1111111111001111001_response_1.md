The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class seems to be due to a logical error in the way newlines are being computed and returned where the `while` loop logic is inconsistent with the intended formatting rules, resulting in output that does not meet the expected values.

The strategy to fix the bug would be to revise the implementation of how newlines are computed and returned based on the specified formatting rules in the `EmptyLineTracker` class, ensuring that the code aligns with the intended behavior outlined in the documentation.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif current_line.is_import:
        if not self.previous_line or (self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_yield and (not self.previous_line or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    else:
        return 0, 0
```

The corrected implementation ensures that the logic aligns with the specified formatting rules and should satisfy the expected input/output values during the failing test execution.
