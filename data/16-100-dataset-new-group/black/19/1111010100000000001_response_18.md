The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is meant to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The potential error locations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function include:
1. Incorrect handling of the `current_line.depth` when setting the `max_allowed`.
2. Incorrect handling of the condition for inserting empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
3. Incorrect handling of the condition for flow control and import lines.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the conditional statements and the handling of `max_allowed`. The function seems to have a complex logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted based on various conditions.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve simplifying the logic of the function to make it easier to understand and debug. Additionally, it would involve ensuring that the `max_allowed` value is set correctly and the conditions for inserting empty lines are handled accurately.

Given the analysis, here's the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator and current_line.depth not in self.previous_defs:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0
    else:
        return min(current_line.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed), 0
```

In the above corrected version, the logic has been simplified to handle the conditions for inserting empty lines more accurately. The `max_allowed` value is set based on the `current_line.depth`, and the conditions for different line types are handled independently. Additionally, the handling of `self.previous_defs` has been updated for correct functionality.
