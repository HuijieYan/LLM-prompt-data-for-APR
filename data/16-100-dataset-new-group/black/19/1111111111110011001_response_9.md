The cause of the bug is that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not setting the attribute `self.previous_line` to the current `current_line` and is not properly updating the `self.previous_defs` list. This leads to incorrect computation and produces wrong output, as observed in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs` attributes are updated correctly with the relevant information for subsequent lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Update self.previous_defs list
    if depth < len(self.previous_defs):
        self.previous_defs = self.previous_defs[:depth]
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    # Update self.previous_line
    previous_line = self.previous_line
    self.previous_line = current_line

    if previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    return newlines, 0
```

The corrected function ensures that the `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs` attributes are updated properly for each input `current_line`, which should fix the bug.
