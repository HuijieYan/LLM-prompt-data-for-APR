Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, we can see that there is a problem with the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is supposed to calculate the number of empty lines to be added before the current line, but the current logic seems to have inconsistencies.

The potential errors in the function include:
1. Inconsistencies in setting the `max_allowed` value based on the depth of the current line.
2. Incorrect handling of different scenarios, such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not consistent in calculating the number of empty lines to be added before the current line based on different contextual information.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to provide consistent and correct calculations for the number of empty lines to be added before the current line. This might involve updating the conditional statements and handling different scenarios more effectively.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - int(bool(current_line.depth))
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This version of the function should provide a more consistent and correct calculation of the number of empty lines to be added before the current line, addressing the issues identified in the buggy version.
