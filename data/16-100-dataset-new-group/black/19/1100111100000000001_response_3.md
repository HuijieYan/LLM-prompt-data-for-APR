The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears to be causing unexpected behavior due to potential logic errors and incorrect comparisons in the conditions. The function is responsible for calculating the number of empty lines to be inserted between lines of code based on certain conditions.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison: There is a comparison `if current_line.is_def` that should be `current_line.is_def()`.

2. Inconsistent methods: There are some methods called as properties, e.g., `current_line.depth`, which could cause a problem.

3. Unsupported comparisons: There are unsupported comparisons made between boolean and integer values in some conditions, like comparing `is_decorator` with `True` or `False`.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
- Change all the properties to methods if they are intended to be methods.
- Use proper boolean checks and conversions in the comparison conditions.
- Update the conditions using proper method calls and comparisons.

Here's possible corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth() == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves():
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves()[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth()
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def() or current_line.is_class():
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth():
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control():
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth()
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth())
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, the functions are now called with proper parentheses to indicate method invocation, and the boolean checks are consistent throughout the conditions.
