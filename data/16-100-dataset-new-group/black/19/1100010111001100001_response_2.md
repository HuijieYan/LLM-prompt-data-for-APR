The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be related to the logic for handling indentation depth and determining whether to insert empty lines.

The cause of the bug is that the function may not correctly handle the behavior of certain types of lines, particularly those related to decorators and imports.

A strategy for fixing the bug could be to carefully rethink the conditions for certain types of lines, such as decorators and imports, and ensure that the function accurately accounts for their behavior in relation to indentation depth.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_def or self.previous_line.is_class):
                return 2, 0
            else:
                return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if depth == 0:
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import) or current_line.is_import:
        if depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        else:
            return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function includes updated logic to handle different line types, particularly decorators, imports, and definitions, based on their behavior in relation to indentation depth. This version should address the issues with the original function and pass the failing test.
