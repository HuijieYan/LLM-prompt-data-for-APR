The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not handling empty lines correctly, causing a failing test. The function is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, but it is not doing so accurately.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly adjusting the number of empty lines based on various conditions and is not properly updating the empty lines tracking logic.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the number of empty lines based on the conditions specified in its docstring and the logic described in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# Corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With the corrected function, the test should pass successfully without any assertion errors.
