The issue in the provided function is that it incorrectly computes the number of empty lines to be inserted in specific cases. This results in incorrect formatting and causes the failing tests. To address this issue, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to insert based on various conditions needs to be revised.

The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` relies on the following context:
- It takes `self` (an instance of `EmptyLineTracker`) and `current_line` (an instance of `Line`) as input parameters.
- It interacts with various attributes and methods of `self` and `current_line` to compute the appropriate number of empty lines to insert.

The failure in the provided test case is due to incorrect computation within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which results in the expected and actual output not matching.

To address this, I would change the computation logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function by analyzing the conditions for determining the number of empty lines with different combinations of `current_line` attributes such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. By revising and refining these conditionals, the incorrect calculation for insertion of empty lines can be fixed.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 0
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
With these changes, we've refined the logic to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on different combinations of conditions. This refined logic should resolve the incorrect formatting and the failing test cases.
