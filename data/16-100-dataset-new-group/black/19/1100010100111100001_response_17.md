The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to the handling of `before` and `newlines` variables. The function is intended to calculate the number of empty lines to insert before the current line, but due to wrong manipulations with `before` and `newlines`, it is currently not working as expected.

The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of conditions and assignments related to `before` and `newlines` variables.

To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic for calculating `before` and `newlines` based on the conditions provided in the function using conditional checks and appropriate assignments.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version handles `before` and `newlines` based on the specific conditions provided in the function. The incorrect assignments and manipulations have been fixed to address the issue identified in the failing test cases.
