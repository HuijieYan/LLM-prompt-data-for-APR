The bug in the given function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to the logic which determines how many newlines to return based on the given input `current_line`. The bug is likely causing incorrect counting of newlines and missing additional newlines in some cases, leading to assertion errors in the failing test. The bug is likely due to the way the values of `before` are reassigned. Specifically, the `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth` loop seems to be overwriting the value of `before`, causing to produce incorrect results with wrong counts of newlines. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` value is not overwritten in the loop. Instead, we should use a different variable to hold the count of newlines, and properly update the `before` value by adding the count of newlines from this variable.

In the corrected code, we'll add a new variable `newlines_count` and use it to update the `before` value after the loop. By doing so, the correct count of newlines will be preserved.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    newlines_count = 0
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        newlines_count = 1 if depth else 2  # Count the newlines
    before += newlines_count  # Update the count of newlines
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The updated version ensures that the `before` value is correctly updated by adding the `newlines_count` after the loop. This should fix the bug and make the function produce correct results for the failing test cases.
