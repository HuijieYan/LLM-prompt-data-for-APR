The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines before specific types of lines in the source code. Based on the failing test message, the mismatch between the expected and actual results indicates that the function incorrectly inserts additional empty lines that were not anticipated. To fix this, we need to carefully review the logic in each conditional block within the function.

There are several conditional blocks in the function that handle different cases based on the attributes of the `current_line` object. Additionally, some of the conditional branches modify the state of the `self` object by adding values to the `previous_defs` list.

In analyzing the failing tests, the expected values suggest that the function needs to accurately determine the number of empty lines that should be inserted before specific lines of code, while avoiding unnecessary insertions. Additionally, the function should correctly update the state of the object `self`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    max_allowed = 1
    newlines = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        # Handle first line in the file
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        # Determine newlines based on depth
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines = 1
        
        if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditional blocks have been simplified and the specific details of the function's logic have been implemented in order to accurately determine how many empty lines need to be inserted before a particular line in the code. The logic related to the `self` object has also been revised to ensure that the state is updated appropriately.

This corrected version should correctly handle the case and output the expected number of empty lines to be inserted before specific lines of code in the source file.
