The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to the logic used to calculate the number of newlines before and after the current line. The function takes a `current_line` object and a list of previous definitions `self.previous_defs` as input and returns a tuple of integers, the first representing the number of newlines before the current line and the second representing the number of newlines after the current line.

The main issues seem to be related to the calculation of `before` variable, the handling of `self.previous_defs` list, and the conditions used to determine the number of newlines before and after the current line.

Based on the provided test case and expected behavior, it seems that `before` should always take the value of `max_allowed` if `current_line.leaves` is empty, and the handling of `self.previous_defs` should be adjusted to align with the required logic.

The suggestion for fixing this bug would be to simplify the logic used to calculate the number of newlines before and after the current line, ensuring that each conditional branch corresponds to the expected behavior according to the test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = max_allowed

    if current_line.depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for `before` assignment and adjusts the handling of `self.previous_defs` list based on the test expectations.

With the corrected version of `_maybe_empty_lines`, the failing tests should now pass.
