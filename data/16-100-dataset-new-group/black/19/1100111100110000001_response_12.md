The cause of the bug is that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in certain cases, leading to a formatting mismatch between the expected and actual results.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # check if the previous line is an import
        and not is_import(current_line)  # check if the current line is not an import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

I made the following updates to the function:
1. Used `is_import(self.previous_line)` instead of `self.previous_line.is_import` to call the helper function `is_import` correctly.
2. Checked if the previous line is an import and the current line is not an import, and if they are at the same depth, in line 42.
3. Removed the comparison of `self.previous_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_import` because `is_import` function returns a boolean value directly.
4. Ensured the correct formatting of the code by checking for empty lines  in the above two conditions.

After making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test mentioned in the error message.
