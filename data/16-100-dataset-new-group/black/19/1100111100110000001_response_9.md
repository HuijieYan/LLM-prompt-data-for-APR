The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to its logic for handling newlines in the code. The failing test suggests that there is an issue with formatting comments within decorators.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Handling of newlines before and after comments and decorators.
2. Comparison of the expected and actual formatted code.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function determines the number of newlines to insert before and after different elements of the code, such as decorators, imports, and yield statements.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the logic for handling newlines and ensuring that comments within decorators are handled correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator and is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.prefix.lstrip().startswith("#"):
            # Don't insert empty lines before comments.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, additional checks have been added to handle comments within decorators and to ensure that empty lines are not inserted before comments. The logic for handling imports and yield statements has also been revised to address the bug.
