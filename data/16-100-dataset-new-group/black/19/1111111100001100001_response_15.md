The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. Additionally, the logic for tracking previous line information seems to be affected by incorrect references or data persistence. Below are the identified issues and a strategy for fixing the bug:

1. **Issue 1:** The logic to determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line is incorrect.
2. **Issue 2:** The tracking of previous line information and the management of `self.previous_defs` have potential issues related to data persistence.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

1. The conditional statements for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line should be reviewed and possibly rewritten.
2. Correct the logic for managing previous line information and updating `self.previous_defs` appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2  # Updated the assignment logic for max_allowed

    before = 0
    first_leaf_prefix = current_line.leaves[0].prefix if current_line.leaves else ''
    before = min(first_leaf_prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)  # Corrected the calculation for before
    
    # Updating previous_defs based on the current line type
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and not current_line.is_import and self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version addresses the identified issues and should now correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line, as well as update the `self.previous_defs` based on the current line type. This should resolve the bugs present in the original function.
