The cause of the bug is related to the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The issue seems to be with the condition that checks for the decorator, def, and class, as well as the handling of previous lines.

It appears that the logic to check for decorators, def, and class might be incorrect as it's causing issues in handling empty lines. Additionally, the handling of previous lines and the control flow may also need to be revised.

To fix this bug, let's update the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that it correctly handles the conditions for decorators, def, and class, as well as the previous lines. We can also add additional conditions to make the control flow more robust and accurate.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n") if current_line.leaves else 0
    before = min(before, max_allowed)

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        should_append = True
        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                should_append = False
            elif self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth:
                should_append = current_line.depth == 0
        if should_append:
            return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in the original function by ensuring that the conditions for decorators, def, and class are correctly handled, and that the control flow is accurate. Additionally, it provides better handling of the previous line's attributes to determine the empty lines to be inserted.

After the correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
