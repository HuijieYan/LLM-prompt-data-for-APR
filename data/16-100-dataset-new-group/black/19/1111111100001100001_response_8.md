The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that can cause it to produce incorrect results. The logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line is quite complex, and the function relies on various external dependencies and attributes of the `current_line` and `self` objects. 

It seems that the calculation of `before` and `newlines` values, as well as handling the `is_decorator` and `depth` conditions, could be problematic. Additionally, there are multiple conditions checking the attributes of the `current_line` and `self.previous_line`, which may not be functioning as expected.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Carefully examine the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
2. Verify the conditions related to `is_decorator`, `depth`, and `previous_line` attributes to ensure they are correctly handled.
3. Debug the function with various input cases and verify the expected output.
4. Consider refactoring the logic to make it more readable and easier to maintain.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, newlines
```

In this corrected version, the conditions are evaluated more explicitly and the logic is simplified for better clarity. Additionally, the issues related to `before` and `newlines` calculations have been addressed. However, further testing and validation may be required to ensure the correctness of the function.
