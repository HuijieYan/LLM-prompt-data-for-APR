The bug arises in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class due to incorrect logic related to calculating the number of empty lines to insert before and after the currently processed line.

The following issues are identified within the buggy function:

1. The `max_allowed` variable is set to 1 at the beginning of the function, and then is overwritten to 2 if `current_line.depth == 0`. As a best practice, the value of `max_allowed` should be determined once based on the condition and then used throughout the function.
2. Inconsistent handling of the `is_decorator` flag and its impact on the `newlines` variable, especially when `is_decorator` is true.
3. Inadequate update of the `before` variable when previous conditions are satisfied, which leads to incorrect calculations of the preceding empty lines.

To fix the issues above, we need to:
- Move the calculation of `max_allowed` to outside the if statements based on `depth`. Once `max_allowed` is determined, it should not be overwritten within the function.
- Reassess the logic related to `is_decorator` and the impact on `newlines`.
- Ensure proper updating of the `before` variable based on conditional blocks and consider its impact on subsequent computations.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `max_allowed` variable is set correctly, and the other variables such as `before` and `newlines` are updated based on the conditional logic that affects their values.
