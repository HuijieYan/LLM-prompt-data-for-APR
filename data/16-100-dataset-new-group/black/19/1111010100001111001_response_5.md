The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing it to return incorrect values based on the input parameters and the internal state of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. Specifically, the logic for computing the number of newlines to insert before and after the currently processed line is flawed. It seems that the computation of `before`, `newlines`, and the last return statement are muddled up, leading to incorrect values.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for computing `before`, `newlines`, and the final return statement in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now accurately compute the number of newlines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line.
