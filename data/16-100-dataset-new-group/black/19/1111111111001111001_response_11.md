The bug in the `EmptyLineTracker` class's `_maybe_empty_lines` method seems to be related to the handling of indentation levels, comment structures, import statements, and decorators. The method fails to correctly compute the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, as multiple scenarios cause the function to return incorrect results when calculating the number of empty lines needed.

The issues mainly arise from the conditional statements and array operations for tracking previous definitions and previous lines, causing the method to incorrectly manipulate the depth and newlines variables. Additionally, the handling of comment structures, imports, decorators, and flow controls seems to be flawed.

To fix the bug, a possible strategy would be to carefully review the entire `_maybe_empty_lines` method and ensure the correct handling of all conditions and variables involved in determining the number of empty lines. Additionally, the conditional statements should be re-evaluated to ensure the correct logic is applied to each scenario.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    should_append_empty_lines = True
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        should_append_empty_lines = False
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        should_append_empty_lines = not (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator)
        if not should_append_empty_lines:
            return 0, 0
    if current_line.is_import:
        should_append_empty_lines = not self.previous_line.is_import and (depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    if current_line.is_yield:
        should_append_empty_lines = not (self.previous_line.is_yield and depth == self.previous_line.depth)
    empty_lines_before = before if should_append_empty_lines else 0
    empty_lines_after = 0 if should_append_empty_lines else 1
    if current_line.depth:
        empty_lines_after -= 1
    return empty_lines_before, empty_lines_after
```

This corrected version addresses the identified issues and is expected to pass the test cases.
