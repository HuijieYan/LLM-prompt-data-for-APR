The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a method `_maybe_empty_lines` which examines the current line and the previous line to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the current line. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `_maybe_empty_lines` method.

The bug occurs because the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not handling the case of a comment in a decorator correctly, which results in an incorrect number of empty lines being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to handle comments in decorators appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        after = 1
        if current_line.prefix.strip().startswith("#"):
            before = 1
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is not None and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            before = 1
        after = 2
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        after = 1
    elif current_line.is_import:
        after = 1 if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import else 0
    elif current_line.is_yield:
        before = 1
        after = 1
    
    return before, after
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case of a comment in a decorator by checking if the current line is a decorator and the prefix starts with a comment character. Depending on these conditions, we adjust the number of empty lines before and after the current line accordingly.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
