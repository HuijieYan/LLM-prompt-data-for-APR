Potential Error Locations:
- The logic that updates the `max_allowed` variable based on the `current_line.depth` may not be working as expected.
- The condition where the `before` variable is updated based on `before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")` may be leading to incorrect results.
- The handling of `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, and `is_flow_control` conditions could be causing issues with the expected output.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function might be due to incorrect logic related to updating the `max_allowed` variable, calculating the `before` variable, and handling various conditions for decorators, class, def, and flow control.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Validate the condition where `max_allowed` is updated based on `current_line.depth`.
2. Review the logic that calculates the `before` variable to ensure it captures the correct number of empty lines.
3. Verify the handling of conditions related to `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, and `is_flow_control` for accurate behavior.

Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def() or current_line.is_class():
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control():
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version:
- Ensure that `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, and `is_flow_control` functions are called with `()` to invoke the functions.
- Update the logic for handling decorators, class, and def conditions based on the called function names.
- Verify that the logic for updating `max_allowed` and `before` variables provides the correct values based on the input `current_line` data.
