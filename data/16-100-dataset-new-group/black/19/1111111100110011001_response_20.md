### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be carefully reviewed to ensure that it correctly computes the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. Special attention should be given to handling different types of `current_line` instances based on its attributes, such as `depth`, `leaves`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.

In the provided error message, the expected and actual output indicated a discrepancy in handling comments within decorators. Additionally, it revealed issues with inserting empty lines and handling the depth of lines in the code.

The fixed version should ensure that the appropriate number of newlines are accounted for based on the context and attributes of the `current_line`. Steps should be taken to correctly handle decorators, imports, and other elements that affect the empty lines before and after the line.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        return 1 if current_line.depth else 2, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```
