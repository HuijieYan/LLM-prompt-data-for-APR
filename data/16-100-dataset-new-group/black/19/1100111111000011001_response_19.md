The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues, mainly related to the incorrect assignment of `newlines` and `before` variables and the conditions used in the function.

It's important to thoroughly analyze the function to understand its intended behavior and use case. The function accepts several parameters and uses them to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted and whether to insert a new line.

To fix the bug, we need to update the assignments and conditions in the function to correctly handle the different cases. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth > 0:  # Change condition to properly handle depth
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0  # Return newlines and before values

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self)  # Call is_import function with self
        and not current_line.is_import(self)  # Call is_import function with self
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)  # Call is_yield function with self
        and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)  # Call is_yield function with self
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
1. The conditions have been updated to ensure that the correct block of code is executed for each specific case.
2. The calls to `is_import` and `is_yield` functions have been updated to include the `self` parameter.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should fix the bugs and pass the failing test.
