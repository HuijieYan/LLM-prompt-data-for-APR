## Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It uses several conditionals to determine the number of empty lines to insert, but there are several issues with the logic that are causing it to fail the test.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely due to incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. The function uses multiple conditionals and checks for different types of lines and their relationship with the previous line. However, the logic is complicated and seems to be inconsistent with the behavior expected by the test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Review and simplify the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
2. Focus on the specific conditions mentioned in the function and ensure they accurately reflect the requirements.
3. Use the test cases to validate the new logic to ensure it passes the failing test.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 1
    elif current_line.is_import and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    elif current_line.is_yield and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    else:
        return 0, 0
```

The corrected version simplifies the logic and directly addresses the specific conditions mentioned in the function. This version focuses on the immediate conditions and determines the number of empty lines based on the type and depth of the current and previous lines. This approach should address the issues and pass the failing test.
