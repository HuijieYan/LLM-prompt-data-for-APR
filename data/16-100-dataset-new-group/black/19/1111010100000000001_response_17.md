## Corrections
First, the dataclass `EmptyLineTracker` is missing an `import` statement for `dataclass`. The corrected version would look like this:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
```

The main issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it is not accessing the attributes within the class `EmptyLineTracker` correctly. The `current_line` object is assumed to be an instance of the `Line` class, but the `Line` class is not defined or imported in the provided code. To fix this, you will need to ensure that `Line` is properly defined and imported.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function after addressing the issues mentioned above and making some assumptions about the `Line` class.

```python
# Add the import statement for Line class (assuming it exists in a separate module)
from some_module import Line

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    previous_defs: List[int]  # assuming this is a list attribute
    previous_line: Optional[Line]  # assuming this is an optional attribute


    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```
This corrected version assumes that the `Line` class is defined and imported, and addresses the issues related to accessing attributes within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. If the assumptions are incorrect, please adjust the code accordingly.
