The bug in the given function appears to be related to the logic used to calculate whether or not to insert empty lines before and after lines in the code. The max allowed value for empty lines is 1, but the bug is incorrectly overwriting this value with 2 when certain conditions are met.

One potential cause of the bug is the condition where `current_line.depth == 0` and `self.previous_line` is `None`. This condition may incorrectly set `max_allowed` to 2, when it should only be 1.

Another potential cause is when setting `before` using the statement `before = 1 if depth else 2`. This statement might be overwriting `before` when unnecessary.

To fix the bug, modify the conditions for setting `max_allowed` and ensure that its value does not exceed 1. Additionally, double-check the conditions for setting `before` and adjust the computation logic as needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0 and self.previous_line:
        max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and not (current_line.is_decorator or self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            newlines = max(1, 2 - depth)  # Only overwrite newlines if necessary
            return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```
This corrected version modifies the conditions regarding the 'max_allowed' value and adjusts how 'newlines' is computed. It ensures that the 'max_allowed' value does not exceed 1 and corrects the logic related to setting 'newlines' based on the depth of the current line.

By addressing these issues, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
