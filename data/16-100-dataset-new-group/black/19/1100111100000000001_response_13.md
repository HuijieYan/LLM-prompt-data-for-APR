The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` relies heavily on the properties and methods of the `current_line` object, as well as the properties and methods of the `self` object (the object that this function is part of). The apparent bug within this function is that it includes a mix of checks for certain conditions, such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_import`, and `is_class`, without considering the correct usage and the relationships between these conditions.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect handling of `self.previous_defs.pop()`
2. Inconsistent use of `current_line` properties and methods such as `depth`, `leaves`, `prefix`, and boolean flags like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_yield`.
3. Redundant conditions and checks within the function.

The cause of the bug is the inconsistent condition checks and the improper handling of edge cases involving the previous and current lines. The use of boolean flags within complex conditional checks further complicates the logic and leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should refactor the function to have more explicit and organized checks based on the context of previous and current lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed_depth = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    # Check if the first leaf in the line has extra newlines and consume them
    before = min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed_depth) if current_line.leaves else 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines between decorators

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function starts with a clear definition of `max_allowed_depth` based on the context of the `current_line`. Then, the conditions and checks for different scenarios are organized in a more structured and clear way. This correction should address the inconsistencies and potential errors in the original buggy function.
