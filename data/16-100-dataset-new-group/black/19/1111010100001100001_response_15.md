The function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that need to be addressed. It incorrectly calculates and applies the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, resulting in incorrect outputs. Some of the identified issues are:
1. Usage of the `max_allowed` variable with incorrect conditions which might result in the wrong value.
2. Incorrect application of empty lines depending on certain conditions such as decorators, flow control, and imports.
3. Incorrect handling of previous line and previous definitions.

Based on the cases provided, there are discrepancies between the expected return values of the function and its actual returned output. These discrepancies indicate that this `_maybe_empty_lines` function has a bug that leads to incorrect functionalities in different conditions.

To resolve these issues, the function should be revised to correctly handle each of the conditions and their respective outputs, and efficiently use the declared variables to calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for each condition - specifically `if/else` statements and variable usage - has been modified to ensure that the appropriate number of empty lines are calculated and returned for each case. This should resolve the discrepancies seen in the test cases and ensure the correct functionality of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
