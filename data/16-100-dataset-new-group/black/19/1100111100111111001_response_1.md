The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` contains logic that sets the value of `max_allowed` based on the depth of the current line. However, the following code does not properly handle the insertion of empty lines in some circumstances, which is causing the tests to fail. The script should be updated to handle the insertion of empty lines correctly based on the specific conditions for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

To fix the bug, the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines based on the conditions specified in the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        should_insert = self._need_empty_lines(current_line)
        if should_insert:
            return 2, 0
        else:
            return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This updated function incorporates the right conditions for inserting empty lines based on decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

After making this change, the corrected version of the function should be tested with the failing test cases to ensure it passes all of them.
