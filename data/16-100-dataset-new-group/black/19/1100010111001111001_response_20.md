The buggy function returns the values of `before` and `newlines` without updating them correctly inside the conditional blocks. There seems to be an issue with the calculations for the `before` variable.

The main issue is that the function is not calculating the correct values for `before` and `newlines` under certain conditions, resulting in the incorrect output.

For example, the second conditional block sets `before` to 1 or 2 based on the depth, but it does not consider and update `newlines`. Similarly, the calculations involving `self.previous_defs` are also not consistent and could result in incorrect values for `before`.

To fix this bug, update the function to ensure that the values of `before` and `newlines` are correctly calculated and updated under all conditions. Also, review the logic and correct any discrepancies to ensure consistent outputs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        before = 0
        newlines = 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        before = max(before, 1)
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        before = max(before, 1)

    return before, newlines
```

With these corrections, the function should now produce the correct results for all the provided test cases.
