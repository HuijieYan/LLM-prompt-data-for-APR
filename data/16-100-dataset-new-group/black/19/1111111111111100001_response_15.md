The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it is not calculating the correct number of empty lines `before` and `after`. The logic to determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is flawed, resulting in incorrect values. Additionally, it is not properly handling the checks for different line types such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly calculate the number of empty lines before and after the current line, and properly handle the checks for different line types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before, after = 0, 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2 if current_line.is_decorator else 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator:
        before, after = 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_class or current_line.is_def:
        if not self.previous_line:  # First line in the file
            before = 0
        elif not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            before, after = 0, 0
        else:
            after = 1 if current_line.is_flow_control else 0
    elif current_line.is_yield:
        before = 1 if not self.previous_line or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth else 0
        after = 0
    elif current_line.is_import:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            before = 1
        elif current_line.depth == 0:
            before = 1
    else:
        before = 0

    return before, after
```

This fixed version of the function implements correct logic to determine the number of empty lines before and after a line based on its type and the type of the previous line.

The function now handles different line types correctly, leading to the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line, and it should pass the failing test.
