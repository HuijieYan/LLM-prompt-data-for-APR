The cause of the bug is that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not handling the potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line correctly. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the number of empty lines to be included before and after the currently processed line, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output in the failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that it accurately computes the number of empty lines required before and after the currently processed line based on the conditions specified in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 0
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            newlines = 0
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            newlines = max(before, 1)
        return 0, newlines
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By using this corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the error in the failing test should be resolved, and the test should pass successfully.
