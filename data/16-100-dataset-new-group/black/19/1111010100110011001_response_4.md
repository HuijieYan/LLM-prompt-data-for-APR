To fix the bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, we need to address the logic that determines the number of empty lines that should occur before and after a given line. It seems that the function is not correctly determining the presence of decorators, classes, flow control, and imports, which leads to an incorrect count of empty lines.

The cause of the bug could be the incorrect logic used to determine whether a line is a decorator or an import, as well as how the depth of the current line is handled.

To fix the bug, we should carefully review the logic used to determine whether a line is a decorator, class, or flow control statement, and how the depth of the line is considered in relation to the previous line.

Given the details provided, the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_line:
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            if not self.previous_line or not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return before, 1
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
            if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                return (before or 1), 0
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
            if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
                return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version will address the issues related to the determination of decorators, classes, flow control, and imports, ensuring that the expected number of empty lines is correctly computed. This should resolve the failing test case and ensure that the expected input/output values are satisfied.
