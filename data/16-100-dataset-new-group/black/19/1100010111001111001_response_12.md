The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be stemming from incorrect logic regarding the use of the `before` variable. Specifically, the reassignment of `before` within the while loop based on the value of `depth` and the use of `or` within the return statements based on the value of `before`.

The `before` variable is being reassigned within the while loop as `1` if `depth` is truthy and `2` if `depth` is falsy. It appears this logic is intended to serve as a conditional check; however, the assignment of a value to `before` within the while loop is likely incorrect as it is replacing the initial assignment.

Additionally, the usage of `before` within the return statements is using `or` in a way that does not conform to the conditional logic implied by previous assignments. Specifically, the expression `(before or 1)` involves an `or` operation where the value of `before` is used if it's truthy, otherwise, it defaults to `1`, and similarly, `(before or 1)` being used in conjunction with the `return` statement is likely leading to the issue.

To fix this issue, a modified approach to manage the conditional logic for the `before` variable and the corresponding return statements may resolve the bug. 

Below is the modified `_maybe_empty_lines` function after addressing the identified issues:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0

```

This modified function addresses the identified issues by correctly managing the conditional logic for the `before` variable and the corresponding return statements.

The modified function should pass the failing test and produce the expected input/output values.
