The cause of the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the condition for setting the value of `before` and `depth` in the first `if` statement is not handled properly, resulting in inconsistent values for these variables. Additionally, the logic for various conditions within the function appear to be leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the conditions and assignment of `before`, `depth`, and other related variables satisfy the expected logic based on the provided test cases. Additionally, the return values need to be properly considered and structured based on the logic of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    before = 0
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version handles the assignment and calculation of `before`, `depth`, and control logic in different situations, addressing the issues from the original buggy function. This should ensure that the returned values align with the expected output based on the provided test cases.
