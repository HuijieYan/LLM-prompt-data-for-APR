# Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, test code
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It is responsible for returning the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

# Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. There are multiple conditional checks and assignments that could lead to incorrect values being set for `before`.
2. The logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted seems to be overly complex and may not cover all necessary cases.
3. The usage of `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs` could lead to incorrect outcomes.

# Explanation of the cause of the bug
The bug may be caused by a combination of incorrect assignments to `before`, overly complex logic for newline insertion, and potential issues with `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs`.

# Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Simplify the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted.
2. Ensure that the correct values are being used for `before`.
3. Validate the usage of `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs` to make sure they are correctly capturing the previous state.

# Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return 1, 0
    
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            before = 1
        return before, after
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            before = 1
        return before, after
    
    return before, after
```
This simplified version of the function aims to address the potential issues with incorrect newline counts and usage of previous states. It sets `before` and `after` based on the conditions specified and aims to provide a more straightforward logic while still covering the necessary cases.
