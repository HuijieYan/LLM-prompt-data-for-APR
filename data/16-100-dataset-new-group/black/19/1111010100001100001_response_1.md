The bug in the _maybe_empty_lines function appears to be related to the calculation of the number of newlines needed before the current_line. This should be handled based on various conditions including the type of current_line and the previous_line, the depth of the current_line, and the previous_defs.

The bug arises from incorrect logic in the _maybe_empty_lines method of the EmptyLineTracker class. As it stands, the logic for computing the newlines and empty line insertion is faulty, leading to incorrect results in various cases.

The issue stems from the incorrect handling of the before and depth variables, as well as the construction of newlines. Therefore, the strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing and revising the conditional statements and variable assignments in the function, particularly where before, depth, and newlines values are determined.

Here's a corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = max(2 - current_line.depth, 0)
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the handling of newlines and the conditions for returning the appropriate values have been revised to align with the intended behavior of the function. This should address the bug and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the input parameters.
