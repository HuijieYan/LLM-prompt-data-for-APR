Based on the provided buggy function, it looks like the issue might be related to the conditions inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function when calculating the number of empty lines to be returned. There are also some issues related to mutated first_leaf.prefix and self.previous_defs list that could possibly affect the outcome.

It seems like a potential bug in the condition that checks for flow control (e.g., if `current_line.is_flow_control`). The expected values are not returned in the buggy function, resulting in test failures.

The function needs to be fixed, specifically the logic inside the while loop for calculating the empty lines, as well as the mutation of the `first_leaf.prefix` and `self.previous_defs`. The conditions and the order in which they are evaluated should also be reviewed.

To fix the bug, we can include separate conditions for different cases, like checking for flow control, imports, yields, yield depth, and decorators, to determine the correct number of empty lines to return.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2

    if current_line.depth == 0 and self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if current_line.is_import:
        newlines = max(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), 1)
        return newlines, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (
        not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), 1), 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return 1, 0
        
    return max_allowed, 0
```

The corrected function should handle all the cases provided and return expected values for each case.
