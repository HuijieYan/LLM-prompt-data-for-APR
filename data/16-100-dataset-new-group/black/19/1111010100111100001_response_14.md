The bug stems from the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. It seems that the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before and after the current line is faulty as it's producing incorrect output. The faulty logic results in incorrect newlines being inserted, causing the expected output to differ from the actual.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted before and after the current line. By revisiting the conditional statements and re-evaluating the condition checks, the bug could be fixed.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max_allowed, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max_allowed, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and provide the expected output based on the failing test cases.
