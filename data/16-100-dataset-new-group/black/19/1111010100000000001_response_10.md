The potential issue with the buggy function lies in the logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the complexity of the logic and the interaction with the `Line` and `previous_defs` attributes, which are not defined in the provided code snippet. This makes it difficult to exactly pinpoint the issue.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
- Ensure that the `Line` class and its attributes used in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function are defined and implemented correctly.
- Check the implementation of the `previous_defs` attribute and its interactions with the current line processing logic.

Here's a potential corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function considering the existing implementation:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth: int, leaves: list, prefix: str, is_decorator: bool, is_def: bool, is_class: bool, is_flow_control: bool, is_import: bool, is_yield: bool):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.prefix = prefix
        self.is_decorator = is_decorator
        self.is_def = is_def
        self.is_class = is_class
        self.is_flow_control = is_flow_control
        self.is_import = is_import
        self.is_yield = is_yield

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_defs = []
        self.previous_line = None

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I assumed the attributes and methods of the `Line` and `EmptyLineTracker` classes based on the usage within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. If these assumptions are incorrect, the correct implementation should be based on the actual definitions and usages in the provided codebase.
