The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Setting the `max_allowed` to 1 before checking if `current_line.depth == 0`.
2. Using `current_line.is_decorator` and `current_line.is_def` as attributes instead of calling the functions `is_decorator` and `is_def`.
3. Incorrect logic for checking flow control and import conditions.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the conditions and attribute references in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This leads to incorrect computation and returning of values, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correct the handling of `max_allowed` based on the condition `current_line.depth == 0`.
2. Call the functions `is_decorator` and `is_def` to get the correct values instead of using them as attributes for `current_line`.
3. Fix the conditional logic for checking flow control and import conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = is_decorator(current_line)
    if is_decorator or is_def(current_line) or is_class(current_line):
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_decorator(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if is_flow_control(current_line):
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, the functions `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` are called to get the correct values for the conditions. Additionally, the `max_allowed` variable is now correctly set based on the condition `current_line.depth == 0` before its usage.
