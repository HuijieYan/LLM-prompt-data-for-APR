The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to provide a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It includes various conditional statements to adjust the number of empty lines based on different properties of the input line, including its depth, the presence of leaves, decorators, and specific behaviors like imports and flow control. 

The reported error messages in the failing test demonstrate a formatting issue in the code generated by `_maybe_empty_lines`. This problem arises from the computation of the prefix of the first leaf of the current line. As evidenced by the test output, the correct number of empty lines is not being inserted before and after decorators, and certain edge cases are not being handled appropriately. As a result, the output does not match the expected input.

To fix these issues, the following buggy code can be corrected and replaced.

    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes

    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(len(first_leaf.prefix.split("\n")) - 1, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            if not self.previous_line:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 0
            return newlines, 0
        return before, 0
```
The corrected version of `_maybe_empty_lines` now includes more specific conditional statements to ensure the correct behavior, especially when handling decorators and line prefixes. This should address the formatting issues in the test cases, providing a more accurate count of the necessary empty lines before and after the processed line.
