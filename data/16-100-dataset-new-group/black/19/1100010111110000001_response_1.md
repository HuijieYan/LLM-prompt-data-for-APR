The bug seems to be related to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `black.py` file. The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method in the test is failing because the expected and actual outputs are not equal. The expected and actual outputs are provided in the error message.

The code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function contains various conditions for handling different cases related to indentation, decorators, imports, flow control, and more. It seems that the function logic is not handling the case where comments within decorators are not being properly accounted for, resulting in the failure of the test.

The best strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, specifically focusing on how it handles comments within decorators. It may be necessary to update the logic to ensure that comments within decorators are treated correctly when determining the number of empty lines to insert.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        and current_line.leaves
        and current_line.leaves[0].type == "COMMENT"
    ):
        # Add handling for comments within decorators
        return 0, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, a new condition is added to handle the case where a comment is encountered within a decorator, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is returned. This should address the issue with comments within decorators and make the test pass successfully.
