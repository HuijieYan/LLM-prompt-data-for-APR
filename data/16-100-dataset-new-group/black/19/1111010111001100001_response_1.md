The issue with the buggy function is that the logic is not handling the calculations of empty lines before and after the currently processed line accurately. In some cases, the incorrect value is returned, leading to failing test cases.

The main cause of the bug lies in the logic of calculating the newlines before and after the current line. There are multiple if-else conditions and their interactions with previous lines that may lead to incorrect computations.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic and ensure that the cases for calculating newlines before and after the current line are handled correctly. Additionally, the handling of previous lines and their type (e.g., flow control, imports, decorators) needs to be modified to account for different scenarios.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return (2, 0)
        else:
            return (0, 0)
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return (1, 1)
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        return (1, 0)
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (1, 0)
    
    if self.previous_line and current_line.depth > self.previous_line.depth:
        return (0, 0)
    
    if self.previous_line and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth and not current_line.leaves:
        return (1, 0)
    
    if self.previous_line and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth and current_line.leaves:
        before = current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")
        return (min(before, 1), 0)
    
    return (0, 0)
```

In the corrected function, the conditions for calculating newlines before and after the current line have been revised. Different scenarios are handled based on the type of current and previous lines, ensuring accurate calculations.

By using this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass successfully.
