The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the conditions for handling decorators, class definitions, and flow control statements are incorrect. Additionally, in some cases, the handling of newlines and depth are incorrect. 

To fix these issues, I will adjust the conditions to handle each case correctly while retaining the correct value of the `before` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        if before > max_allowed:
            before = max_allowed
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if not current_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_def and not current_line.is_class:
        if depth == 0:
            self.previous_defs = [0]
        else:
            while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
                self.previous_defs.pop()
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return max_allowed, 0
        else:
            return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before or 1, 1), 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before or 1, 1), 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I adjusted the conditions to correctly handle scenarios where the previous line involves decorators, flow control, imports, and yield statements, ensuring that the appropriate number of newlines is returned in each case to satisfy the expected values for different inputs.
