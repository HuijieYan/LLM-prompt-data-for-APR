The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect initialization and reassignment of the variable `max_allowed`. Additionally, the logic to determine the number of newlines to be inserted is not consistent with the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the function to properly handle the assignment and reassignment of `max_allowed` and update the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted based on the given conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if len(current_line.leaves) > 0:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
