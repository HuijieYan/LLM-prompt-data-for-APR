The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs because the conditions to check for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` are not being checked correctly. 

To fix the bug, we should first remove the duplicate `append` function from the provided code. Then, we need to ensure that the conditions to check for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` are properly evaluated based on the `current_line` attributes. Also, we need to address the checks for the previous line in such a way that it appropriately handles all expected input and output values. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the above corrected function, we have fixed the condition checks for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` to correctly handle the different scenarios. Additionally, we have modified the conditional logic for handling the previous line to satisfy the expected input and output values in all cases.
