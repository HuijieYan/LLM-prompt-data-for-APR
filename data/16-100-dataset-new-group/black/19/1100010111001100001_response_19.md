The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is that the logic for computing the number of empty lines before the current line is incorrect. The function computes the `before` variable based on certain conditions, but it overrides its value when popping elements from `self.previous_defs` list, which causes incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for computing the `before` variable and separate the handling of cases when `self.previous_defs` is not empty and when it is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)  # Store the current depth
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The key changes are:
- Moving the logic for computing `before` when `self.previous_defs` is not empty to a separate block to avoid overriding its value.
- Storing the current depth in `self.previous_defs` when the line is a decorator, definition, or class.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
