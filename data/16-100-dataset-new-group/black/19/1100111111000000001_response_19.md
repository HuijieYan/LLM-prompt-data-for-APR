The potential errors within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function are likely in the conditional statements and the calculations involving `max_allowed`. It seems that the condition for setting `max_allowed` to 2 may not be working as intended, and the conditional checks for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_yield` and `is_import` might have issues as well.

The cause of the bug could be a combination of incorrect conditionals and incorrect calculations affecting the return values of the function. Additionally, the handling of `self.previous_defs` and the comparisons with `self.previous_line` seem to be part of the issue.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and comparisons need to be thoroughly reviewed and the logic within each block needs to be recalculated if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
        and not current_line.is_import(self)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
        and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks were reviewed and recalculated to ensure the correct logic and expected return values for each condition. Additionally, some comparison and assignment issues were fixed to align with the expected behavior of the function. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
