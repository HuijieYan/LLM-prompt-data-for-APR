The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrectly reassigning the value of `before` inside the while loop, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
2. Incorrectly checking for `is_decorator` before calling `self.previous_defs.append(depth)`.
3. Incorrectly returning the `newlines` value inside the function.

The cause of the bug is that the `before` variable is being reassigned inside the while loop, which may not give the expected value in the subsequent code.

To fix the bug, the `before` variable should be treated differently inside the while loop and the return value of `newlines` needs to be updated based on the conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    original_before = before  # Store the original value of "before"
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return original_before, 1  # return original_before instead of 'before' 

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (original_before or 1), 0  # return original_before instead of 'before'

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (original_before or 1), 0  # return original_before instead of 'before'

    return original_before, 0  # return original_before instead of 'before'
```
In this corrected version:
- The original value of `before` is stored in a variable `original_before` before entering the while loop to prevent reassignment inside the loop.
- The original value of `before` is returned instead of the potentially modified value.
- The return value of `newlines` is updated based on the conditions and `original_before` value is used where necessary.
