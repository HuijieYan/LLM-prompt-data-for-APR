The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely due to incorrect calculation and overwriting of the `before` variable. This variable should represent the number of empty lines that can be added before the current line, based on certain conditions. This variable is being calculating and overwritten at multiple points in the function, leading to incorrect values and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, incorporate a single consistent logic to calculate the `before` value and only update it once before final return. Consider using conditional checks for each condition and updating the `before` variable accordingly without reassigning to previous values at multiple points.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This revised version incorporates a single consistent logic to calculate the `before` value and only updates it once before the final return. This ensures that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the given input conditions, improving the functionâ€™s accuracy and fixing the bug.
