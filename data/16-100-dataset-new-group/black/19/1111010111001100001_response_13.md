The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that can cause it to fail. The function attempts to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. There are several relevant conditional checks and assignments, but the logic seems to be inconsistent.

One potential cause for the bug is the incorrect handling of the `before` variable in the `while` loop. The original code sets `before` to 1 or 2 within the loop without further context, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

Based on the given test cases and runtime values, the function fails to return the expected number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. In some cases, the behavior of the function is inconsistent with its intended functionality.

To fix the bug, the function logic needs to be revised to properly handle the conditional checks and assignments. By analyzing the input parameters, the function should accurately determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line by considering all relevant contexts.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.depth):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2

        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic has been adjusted to handle the conditional checks properly and return the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line. The code is restructured to account for all relevant contexts and for better readability and maintainability. This revised version should fix the bug and pass the failing test cases.
