Potential errors:
1. The initial value of `max_allowed` is set to 1 and then updated later, but it is not used anywhere within the function. This may cause confusion and unnecessary complexity in the code.
2. The logic of setting the value of `before` inside the while loop seems incorrect.

Cause of the bug:
The initial value of `max_allowed` is never used, and the logic inside the while loop seems to be incorrect, potentially overriding the value of `before` for certain conditions.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary assignment and condition related to `max_allowed`.
2. Review the logic inside the while loop to correctly update the value of `before` based on the conditions.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
