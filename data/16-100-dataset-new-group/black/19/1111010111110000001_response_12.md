The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It does this by setting the variables `before` and `newlines` based on the current line's attributes. However, the function seems to be modifying the `current_line` object, which could be causing the unexpected behavior.

The test function `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing with an AssertionError. It compares the expected output with the actual output, and they do not match.

The error message indicates that the format of the actual output is different from the expected output. This suggests that the empty line calculations in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function may be modifying the input in an unexpected way, leading to differences in the output.

To fix the bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to perform the empty line calculations without modifying the input `current_line` object, as doing so could have unintended consequences and alter the actual output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        depth = current_line.depth
        if depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        leaves = list(current_line.leaves)  # Create a copy of the leaves to avoid modifying the input
        if leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            # No need to modify the actual input, just use the calculated value
        else:
            before = 0
        previous_defs = list(self.previous_defs)  # Create a copy of previous_defs to avoid modifying the input
        while previous_defs and previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, copies of the `leaves` and `previous_defs` are made and used for calculations to avoid modifying the input objects. This should prevent unexpected changes to the input and ensure that the function correctly calculates the empty line requirements.
