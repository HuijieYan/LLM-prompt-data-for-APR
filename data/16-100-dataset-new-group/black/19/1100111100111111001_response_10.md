The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` doesn't behave as expected since it doesn't handle the logic of the previous line correctly and incorrectly updates the `before` and `is_decorator` variables. It also seems to misbehave when handling decorators, as the current logic is not correct for inserting or skipping empty lines.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the logic for updating the `before` and `is_decorator` variables is correct and handles decorators, flow control, import, and yield conditions correctly.
2. Update the logic for whether to insert or skip empty lines for decorators and update the functioning based on the previous line's conditions.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield):
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues with the buggy function and enable it to handle the conditions correctly, resolving the failing test cases.
