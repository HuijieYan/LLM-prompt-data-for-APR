The bug seems to be related to the logic used to determine the number of newlines to be inserted before the current line. The incorrect number of newlines is causing the incorrect assertion with expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for inserting newlines based on the current_line characteristics. Specifically, we need to update the conditions that are used to determine the number of newlines to be inserted.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, len(self.previous_line.leaves)), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, len(self.previous_line.leaves)), 0

    return 0, 0
```

The above corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
