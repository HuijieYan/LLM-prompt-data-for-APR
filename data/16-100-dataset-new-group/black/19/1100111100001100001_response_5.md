Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and relevant variables before the function's return, it seems that the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not functioning properly. The potential error locations can be traced to the handling of various conditions such as `is_import`, `is_decorator` and the manipulation of `before` variable. The erroneous logic in these portions could lead to incorrect return values causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, adjust the conditional checks and variable manipulations to ensure that the correct values are returned based on the input parameters and the state of relevant variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditional checks and variable manipulations have been adjusted to ensure that the correct values are returned based on the input parameters and the state of relevant variables.
