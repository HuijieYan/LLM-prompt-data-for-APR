The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a few issues that need to be addressed. It seems that the logic for calculating the number of empty lines is being affected by multiple modifications within the same context and the calculation is not effectively taking into account all of the relevant conditions specified in the comments.

After analyzing the provided runtime input/output values, it becomes clear that the faulty portion of the code lies in the conditional logic for calculating the number of empty lines, as well as the handling of the `self.previous_defs` list. In some cases, the modification of `before` value is not accurately capturing the necessary number of newlines.

Based on the analysis, it is suggested that the function is refactored to create a clear and precise flow control logic that effectively encapsulates the varying conditions outlined in the comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth == 0:
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        else:
            return before, 0

    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By refactoring the function, a more explicit flow of control is established based on the conditions specified in the comments and corrected the computation of the number of newlines. This should help resolve the buggy behavior and ensure that the corrected version of the function passes the failing test.
