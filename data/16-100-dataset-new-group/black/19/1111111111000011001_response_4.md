Based on the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

The expected values for different cases indicate that there are certain conditions based on `current_line` attributes such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` that should trigger specific behavior in the function. However, it appears that the current implementation of `_maybe_empty_lines` is not appropriately handling these conditions, resulting in failing test cases.

Here's a suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, with special attention to how it handles the conditions based on `current_line` attributes.
2. Update the conditional blocks in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that they handle the expected behaviors for different types of `current_line`s or `leaf`s.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""

        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth

        if depth > 0:
            while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
                self.previous_defs.pop()
                before = 1 if depth else 2

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)

            if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not (current_line.is_yield and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0

        return before, 0
```

By making these changes to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the expected behaviors for different cases based on the `current_line` attributes should now be handled correctly, fixing the bug.
