### Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is being used to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It appears that the logic inside the function is complex and involves various conditional checks based on the state of the input `current_line`. The function appears to have multiple potential error locations due to the complexity of the logic.

### Cause of Bug
The bug could be caused by incorrect conditional checks and updates to the variables. The input parameters `current_line` and `self` may not be handled properly for all cases, leading to incorrect values being assigned to `max_allowed`, `before`, and other variables. This could result in incorrect computation and incorrect returns for the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Carefully review and rewrite the logic inside the function to ensure that the conditional checks handle all possible cases accurately.
2. Ensure that the input parameters `current_line` and `self` are used correctly with proper handling of edge cases and conditions.

### Bug-Fixed Version
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth
        if self.previous_defs:
            while self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
                self.previous_defs.pop()
                before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if not self.previous_line:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```
In this updated version of the function, the conditional checks have been revised to ensure that all possible cases are handled accurately. The handling of input parameters `current_line` and `self` has been reviewed to ensure proper computation and return of the function.
