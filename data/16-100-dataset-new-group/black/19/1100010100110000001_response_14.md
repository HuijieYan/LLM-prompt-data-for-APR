The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is causing an error in the test because it is not handling indentation and newlines correctly. It seems that the function is supposed to calculate the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line based on certain conditions. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output, suggesting that the function is not correctly calculating the number of empty lines.

The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of indentation levels and newlines within the code. The function needs to properly account for the indentation and newline characters in the input and calculate the appropriate number of empty lines to be inserted.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation depth, newlines, and the specific conditions for different types of lines (e.g., decorators, flow control, import lines, yield lines, etc.).

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we have ensured that the function correctly calculates the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line based on the given conditions, including proper handling of indentation and newlines.
