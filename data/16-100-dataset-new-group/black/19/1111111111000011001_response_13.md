It seems that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not performing as expected and causes the failing test, especially due to the calculation of `is_decorator`. The logic within this function seems complex and its usage and integration with the other related functions in the class need to be examined thoroughly.

One strategy to fix the bug is to first carefully review the purpose of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and its relationship with the other methods in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It's essential to ensure that all the conditions and logic are aligned to correctly determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

Additionally, care should be taken to correctly handle the `is_decorator` and related conditions, as it seems to have a significant influence on the final output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines if leaves are present
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Handle previous_defs and update before if necessary
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```
This corrected version aligns the logic with the expected behaviors and variable types according to the provided failing test cases. It addresses the conditions and calculations for `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` variables to ensure that the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
