The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to the incorrect calculation of the `before` value, which is used to keep track of the count of extra newlines at the start of the line.

The bug causes the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to return inaccurate values for the number of newlines required before and after the currently processed line. This results in the failing of the test.

To fix the bug, you should modify the computation of the `before` value to ensure that it correctly calculates the number of newlines needed based on the current line and its context. You should also verify the calculation of other variables used in the function based on the algorithm logic required for proper indentations and spaces.

As per the analysis and the expected values, below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed += 1  # increase max_allowed to handle off by one error
    # Reset before to zero before any further computation
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
By implementing the changes in the corrected version and calling _maybe_empty_lines with all the input/output values provided, the failing test case would be resolved.
