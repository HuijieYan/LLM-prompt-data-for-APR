There is a bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that causes it to fail the `test_comment_in_decorator` test. The bug is likely in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert before certain types of lines.

The function checks if the current line is a decorator, a def, a class, or a flow control statement and then attempts to determine how many empty lines to insert before it based on various conditions. However, there are issues in the logic where it may not correctly calculate the number of empty lines required.

To fix this bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines before certain types of lines needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for determining the number of empty lines before decorators, defs, classes, and flow control statements has been adjusted to resolve the bug. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
