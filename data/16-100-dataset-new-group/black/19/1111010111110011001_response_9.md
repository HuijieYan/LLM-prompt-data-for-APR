The issue in the provided code is that the logic inside the '_maybe_empty_lines' function is not correctly handling the computation of empty lines between different types of lines. This results in incorrect numbers of empty lines being inserted between lines when it is not expected.

To fix this issue, we need to review the logic inside the '_maybe_empty_lines' function and ensure that the computation of empty lines is correctly handled for different types of lines ('is_decorator', 'is_def', 'is_class', etc.)

Here's a corrected version of the '_maybe_empty_lines' function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if (is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class) and self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic inside the function according to the expected behavior, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
