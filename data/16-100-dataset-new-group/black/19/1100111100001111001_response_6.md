The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be related to how it assigns the `newlines` value based on the current line's properties and the previous line's properties.

It is expected that the function should return the number of empty lines required before inserting the new code in the current line by identifying the type of the current line and the previous line.

The bug is likely within the conditionals that apply different calculations to `newlines` based on the type of the current line and the previous line. The error may be caused by mishandling of conditional logic while calculating the number of newlines.

One strategy for fixing this bug could be to review and refine the conditional logic and the calculations for newlines. This includes verifying the type of the previous line and the current line, ensuring the cumulative requirements for newlines are correct. Further, the conditions that control the return values at the end of the function should be thoroughly reviewed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function ensures proper calculation of the required empty lines based on the specific conditions of the current and previous lines, and should satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the failing tests.
