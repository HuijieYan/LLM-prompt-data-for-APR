Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the incorrect behavior of the function while determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, especially when checking for decorators, classes, yield and flow control. 

To fix the bug, a more accurate calculation of the empty lines is required based on the context of the current line and the previous line. We should also ensure that the logic for determining these empty lines is correctly executed for each condition.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from collections import deque
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Union, Tuple

Leaf = any  # Mocked for simplicity
Line = any  # Mocked for simplicity

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    previous_line: Union[None, Line] = None
    previous_after: int = 0
    previous_defs: List[int] = []


def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    lines_before = 0
    lines_after = 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_def = current_line.is_def
    is_class = current_line.is_class
    is_yield = current_line.is_yield
    is_import = current_line.is_import
    is_flow_control = current_line.is_flow_control

    if not is_decorator and not is_def and not is_class:
        self.previous_defs = [x for x in self.previous_defs if x < current_line.depth]

    if is_decorator or is_def or is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            lines_before = 0
        else:
            lines_before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        lines_after = 0
        
    elif is_flow_control:
        lines_before = max(current_line.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        lines_after = 1
        
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        lines_before = max(current_line.prefix.count("\n"), 1)
        
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        lines_before = max(current_line.prefix.count("\n"), 1)
        
    return lines_before, lines_after
```

In the corrected version, the function now accurately calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on different conditions such as decorators, flow control, imports, and others. Additionally, the logic for managing the `self.previous_defs` list is modified to accurately include and remove the corresponding depth levels.

The variable `max_allowed` is now determined based on a conditional check on the depth of the current line to accurately set the upper limit of empty lines allowed.

This corrected version should address the issues identified and ensure the proper behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. As a result, it should pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output values for each case.
