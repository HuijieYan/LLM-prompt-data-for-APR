Looking at the provided code and the failing test cases, it seems that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the logic to insert empty lines based on certain conditions. The handling of `before` and the computation of `newlines` based on conditions is resulting in incorrect output.

The first potential issue is with the block of code that checks for decorators, defs, classes, and flow control statements. It seems to have some incorrect logic around these conditions, causing it to return the wrong number of newlines.

Another issue is the block of code that checks if the previous line was an import or a yield and then determines the number of newlines based on this condition, underscored by the failing tests.

Based on the error message and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the function is not handling certain conditions correctly, causing it to generate incorrect empty lines in the output.

To fix this, we should reconsider the conditions and logic to determine the number of empty lines to insert. We may need to rework the conditions for decorators, defs, classes, flow control statements, and handling of imports and yield statements.

Below is the corrected version of the `maybe_empty_lines` function after addressing the identified issues.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Updated logic for handling decorators, defs, classes, and flow control statements
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    # Updated logic for handling flow control statements
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 1

    # Updated logic for handling imports and yields
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and (self.previous_line.is_import or self.previous_line.is_yield)
        and not (current_line.is_import or current_line.is_yield)
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

These changes should address the issues observed in the failing test cases by providing a more accurate and correct logic to handle the insertion of empty lines based on various conditions.
