The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears to be related to code formatting, specifically for adding or removing empty lines in the source code. The function takes a `current_line` object and returns a tuple containing the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the `current_line`.

Upon analyzing the function, potential error locations can be identified in the sections where the number of empty lines to be inserted is determined based on various conditions such as `current_line` properties, previous line properties, and depth.

The cause of the bug might be due to incorrect calculations and conditions for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the `current_line`. This could lead to inconsistent formatting and incorrect insertion of empty lines.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to review and revise the conditions and calculations for determining the number of empty lines. This may involve ensuring that the logic for checking the `current_line` properties and previous line properties is accurate and correctly reflects the desired code formatting rules.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
            return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for determining the number of empty lines have been reviewed and revised to reflect the desired code formatting rules. This version should pass the failing test for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
