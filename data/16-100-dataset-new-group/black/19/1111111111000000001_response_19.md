The potential bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the conditionals and comparisons involving the `current_line` and `previous_line` attributes. These comparisons are used to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line.

Looking at the failing test function `test_comment_in_decorator`, it seems to be related to comments within decorators and their respective formatting. This suggests that the bug in `_maybe_empty_lines` might be related to how the function handles decorators and comments, potentially leading to incorrect formatting in some cases.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to carefully review and update the conditional statements and comparisons in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, especially those related to decorators, comments, and flow control, to ensure they accurately reflect the desired behavior for formatting empty lines.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function now uses the `is_import()` and `is_yield()` methods to check if the current and previous lines are imports and yields, respectively, instead of directly accessing the attributes. This should fix the bug related to incorrect formatting, especially when dealing with comments within decorators and other flow control constructs.
