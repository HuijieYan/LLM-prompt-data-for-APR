The bug in the code causes the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to return incorrect values for the number of empty lines that should be inserted before and after the currently processed line. This is due to the incorrect management of newlines and depth tracking within the function.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately calculate the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line based on various conditions. This includes checking the depth of the current line, whether it's a decorator, a flow control statement, an import statement, or a yield statement, and tracking the previous line's properties.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    if not current_line.leaves:
        return 0, 0

    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
    before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
    first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected function, we accurately calculate the `max_allowed` based on the current line's depth. We also address the conditional checks for adjusting `before` based on current and previous line properties. Additionally, we ensure that `first_leaf.prefix` is correctly updated and that the `previous_defs` stack is managed accurately.

This corrected version should resolve the issue with the buggy function and provide accurate values for the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line.
