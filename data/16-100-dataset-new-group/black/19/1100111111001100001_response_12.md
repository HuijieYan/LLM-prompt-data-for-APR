The buggy function seems to be intended for code formatting, specifically to handle empty lines. It operates based on the context of the "current line" in the input code. However, there are several potential issues with the function that could cause it to fail.

1. In Case 2, `previous_line` is being considered as None, which is incorrect behavior. This suggests that the initial assumption about `previous_line` not being None is incorrect.

2. In Case 7, `previous_defs` is being modified. It seems like this modification could cause incorrect behavior in subsequent calls to the function.

To fix the bug, you should first address any inconsistencies related to handling the `previous_line` and `previous_defs` objects, and then revisit the logic for handling empty lines at the end of the function.

Here's a corrected version of the function based on the analysis:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines before decorators or at the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This version aims to fix the reported issues and improve the conditional logic of the function. After the fix, it should be retested to verify that it passes the failing tests.
