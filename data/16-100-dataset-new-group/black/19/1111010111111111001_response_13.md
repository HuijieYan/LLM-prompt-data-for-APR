There is an issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. From the runtime and expected values of the input parameters and return variables, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the computation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions.

The function is currently modifying the `before` variable within a loop while also modifying the `depth` variable outside that loop, which is affecting the computation of `before` and `newlines`.

To fix the bug, the loop that updates `before` based on `depth` needs to be adjusted. `newlines` is also not correctly computed based on the conditions provided. Therefore, adding a calculated `newlines` value should help ensure it is correctly generated.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    newlines_before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        newlines_before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines_after = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines_after -= 1
        return newlines_before, newlines_after

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the computation of `before` based on `depth` and ensuring that `newlines` is correctly computed and returned, the function should now handle the computation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line correctly and pass the provided test cases.
