The issue in the buggy function is that it's not correctly updating the `before` variable based on certain conditions, leading to incorrect whitespace handling.

The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has an issue with handling the `before` value based on different conditions. The current implementation leads to incorrect handling of whitespace insertion, resulting in failing tests.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect handling of `before` variable when consuming the extra newlines from the first leaf's prefix.
2. Incorrect setting of `before` variable value in the while loop.
3. Incorrect return values for certain conditions.

To resolve the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly set the `before` variable in each condition. Additionally, we need to revise the return values to ensure the correct number of newlines are added based on the conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        if before > max_allowed:
            first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.replace("\n", "", before - max_allowed)
            before = max_allowed
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else max_allowed

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With the corrected logic, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle the `before` variable correctly based on various conditions, and the failing test should pass.
