The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is leading to incorrect behavior, causing the failing tests. The incorrect behavior is observed when determining the number of empty lines to insert before a given line of code. The max_allowed value seems to be determined correctly based on the conditions, but its handling during the return statements is causing unexpected behavior.

The strategies for fixing the bug could involve reviewing the conditions and checks related to determining the `newlines` and `before` values to ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on different scenarios.

Given the identified issue and possible strategies, a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Modified the condition to correctly handle empty lines before imports and yields
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ) or (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions for handling `is_import` and `is_yield` have been modified to ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the scenarios described in the failing test cases. With these changes, the function should return the expected values and effectively insert the required number of empty lines.
