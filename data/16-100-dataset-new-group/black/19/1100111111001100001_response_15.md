The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to the logic that decides when to insert empty lines between lines of code. The improper handling of `before`, which decides the number of empty lines to insert before the current line, could be a potential issue leading to the failing tests. Based on the provided information, the following issues can be identified:

1. In Cases 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, the value of `max_allowed` is always set to `2`, which contradicts the logic of the code. The value of `max_allowed` should be dynamic based on the depth of the current line, but it is incorrectly being set to `2` directly. The value of `max_allowed` should be set to `1` if the depth is not greater than 0, and `2` otherwise.

2. In Case 7, the function adds `0` to `self.previous_defs` if `current_line.is_def` is `True`, which seems incorrect because the function may need to add `depth` instead of `0` to `self.previous_defs` under certain conditions. This may not accurately capture the depth of the previous function definition.

To address these issues, the logic related to `max_allowed` and `self.previous_defs` needs to be modified.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the identified issues:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 1
    else:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    ...
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

```

This correction updates the logic of `max_allowed` and ensures that the `self.previous_defs` array is updated with the correct depth of previous definitions.

Applying these changes should fix the identified issues based on the provided data and help the function to pass the failing test.
