The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted between lines of code. Based on the analysis of the failing test and the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it looks like the `before` variable in the function is not always being handled correctly for certain line types.

In particular, it seems that the handling of the `before` variable may be incorrect when encountering lines where `current_line.is_def` or `current_line.is_class` are `True`. Additionally, the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the previous line's characteristics (e.g., `self.previous_line.is_decorator`) might not be correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, you can modify the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the type of the current line and the characteristics of the previous line. Specifically, pay attention to how the `before` variable is being calculated and utilized. Ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the line types and other conditions specified in the function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # update handling of before variable based on conditions
    before = 0  # initialize before variable

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            
            return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the handling of the `before` variable is ensured to be consistent with the conditions specified in the function. The conditions for different line types are reviewed and updated to ensure the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the specific line characteristics. This should address the issues observed in the failing test cases.
