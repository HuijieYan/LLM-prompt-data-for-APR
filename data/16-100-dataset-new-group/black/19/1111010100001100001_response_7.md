The bug within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class is likely caused by improper handling of the `before` variable, particularly when it comes to the conditions for updating `before` value based on `depth`.

Here's the strategy for fixing the bug:
- The `before` variable should only be updated in certain conditions related to depth, decorators, import and yield, and flow control.
- It seems the intention is to update `before` based on `depth` only if the previous line is a decorator, an import, or a yield. Otherwise, `before` should be set to a default value of `0`.
- Additionally, the removal operation on the `self.previous_defs` list, and its subsequent conditions, needs to be reviewed to ensure it's correctly setting the value of `before` based on the context of the previous line and the `current_line`.

Based on these observations, here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    before = 0
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    elif current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_import or current_line.is_yield:
        before = 1

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the value of `max_allowed` is set based on the condition on the current_line's depth. The `before` value is now set based on the current and previous line type, depth, and state. Additionally, the condition that was responsible for setting `before` in the buggy function has been appropriately rearranged.

The corrected function ensures that `before` is updated based on conditions related to depth, decorators, imports, yield, and flow control. This should address the potential issues present in the original buggy function.
