The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` contains several conditions and operations that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior. Some of the potential errors include incorrect indentation of code blocks, unnecessary reassignments of variables, and incorrect checking of boolean conditions.

To fix the bug, we should revise the logic within the function to ensure that it properly handles the different cases and conditions. It's especially important to accurately update the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` variables based on the conditions being checked.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we've applied the following changes:
1. Refactored the `min` function to directly calculate the `before` variable instead of reassigning it repeatedly.
2. Modified the condition to correctly determine when to return 0, 0 based on the `is_decorator` condition.
3. Properly handled the conditions for checking flow control, import lines, and yield lines to accurately calculate the return values.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
