The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple issues that need to be addressed:

1. There are multiple conditions that are mutually exclusive but not checked in the correct order, leading to incorrect logic flow and multiple returns.
2. Inconsistent point of updates for `before` variable.
3. Inconsistent point of updating `self.previous_defs`.
4. Inconsistent execution flows and missing handling for some cases.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to:
1. Reorder the conditional checks so that mutually exclusive conditions are checked in the correct order.
2. Update the `before` and `self.previous_defs` variables at consistent points.
3. Ensure that all possible code execution flows are handled and return values are consistent with the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of `_maybe_empty_lines` handles the conditional statements in a consistent and mutually exclusive manner, updates the `before` variable at the correct location, and ensures that all potential execution paths are handled.
