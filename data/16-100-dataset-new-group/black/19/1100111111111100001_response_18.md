Based on the analysis of the failing test, it looks like the issue is mainly with the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function seems to be improperly controlling the insertion of newlines which causes incorrect formatting.

The error is occurring due to the incorrect insertion of newlines. Specifically, the issue seems to be with the logic for classifying different line types and deciding when to insert newlines. The incorrect insertion of newlines is causing the final formatted output to differ from the expected output.

To fix this issue, we should adjust the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to more accurately categorize lines and ensure the correct insertion of newlines according to the formatting rules.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0 and not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0  # Returns the number of new lines to insert and the number of spaces to insert.

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1  # Insert one space after flow control statements.

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0  # Insert 1 empty line if the previous line is an import and the current line is not an import.

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0  # Insert 1 empty line if the previous line is a yield and the current line is not a yield or they are at different depths.

    return 0, 0  # No empty lines or spaces to insert by default.
```

In this corrected version of the function, we have adjusted the logic to more accurately categorize different line types and decide when to insert newlines. The `if-else` statements have been rearranged to ensure the correct handling of different line types and the proper insertion of newlines.

With this corrected logic, the test should pass, and the function should produce the expected formatted output.
