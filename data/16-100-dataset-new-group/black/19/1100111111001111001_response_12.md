The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that after checking the `current_line` for different conditions, there is no proper condition to handle the case where none of the conditions are met. This causes the function to return incorrect values.

The `max_allowed` value should be set after each condition, and before returning the final result. Additionally, the `newlines` and `is_decorator` variables need to be handled carefully to ensure the correct output.

To fix the bug, we will revise the `if` conditions and their corresponding return values. A corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Handle the case where the conditions are not met
    if not current_line.leaves or not current_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_def \
        and not current_line.is_class and not current_line.is_flow_control and not current_line.is_import \
        and not current_line.is_yield:
        return before, 0

    # Handle other cases as before
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import \
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we first handle the case where none of the conditions are met. Then, the other cases are handled as before to ensure the correct output for each condition.
