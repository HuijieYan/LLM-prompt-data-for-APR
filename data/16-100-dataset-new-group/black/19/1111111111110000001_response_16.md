The possible error locations within the provided buggy function are:

1. Variable `max_allowed` is not properly set based on the value of `current_line.depth`.
2. Usage of `self.previous_defs` without checking if it exists or not.
3. Condition for handling decorators and flow control statements seems to be incorrect and causing unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the conditions for `max_allowed`, `self.previous_defs`, and conditions related to decorators and flow control statements.

To fix the bug, the conditions for `max_allowed`, `self.previous_defs`, decorators, and flow control statements should be properly checked and handled.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
   
    # Checking if self.previous_defs exists and setting a default value
    if not hasattr(self, "previous_defs"):
        self.previous_defs = []
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator and depth not in self.previous_defs:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for the existence of `self.previous_defs` and initialized it if it does not exist. Additionally, we have modified the conditions and logic for handling decorators, flow control, and `max_allowed` to ensure that the function behaves correctly.
