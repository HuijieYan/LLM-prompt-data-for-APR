The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be incorrectly determining the number of empty lines to be inserted in the code based on certain conditions. It's using the `max_allowed` variable which is overridden to different values, but it's not being used consistently throughout the function. Additionally, there are conditional return statements that might not be handling all cases correctly.

The bugs in the function are caused by a combination of conditions not being handled properly and incorrect handling of the `max_allowed` variable. To fix these issues, the function must be rewritten to address the conditional cases more explicitly and consistently.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # Case where the current line has leaves
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:

1. The conditions are explicitly handled in the correct order, ensuring that all possible cases are managed properly.
2. The `max_allowed` variable is consistently used to limit the number of newlines before the line output.
3. The conditions are structured to avoid unnecessary checks, and the code is more concise and easier to understand.

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should address the issues and pass the failing tests.
