The bug arises from the `while` loop inside the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function. 

The `before` variable is already set in the `if not current_line.leaves` block and is later overwritten in the `while` loop. In each iteration of the `while` loop, the `before` variable is being set to a value of 1 if the `depth` variable is truthy, otherwise to 2. This results in the incorrect return of the `before` value.

To fix this, we will add an additional variable to remember the original value of `before` to avoid overwriting it in each iteration of the `while` loop. By using the original `before` value and incrementing it in each iteration, the function will correctly calculate the appropriate leading newline count.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0  # Initialize the new variable
    if not current_line.leaves:
        before = 0
    else:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    original_before = before  # Store the original 'before' value
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = original_before + 1 if depth else original_before + 2  # Use original_before
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this corrected version, the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function will now correctly handle the calculation of the `before` variable and return the expected newline counts.
