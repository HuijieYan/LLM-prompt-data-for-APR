The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. One potential error location is the if-else statements for handling decorators, flow control, and imports.

The cause of the bug may be that the logic within the function is not correctly handling the conditions for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This is evident from the failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator` where the actual result does not match the expected result.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to carefully review the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that the conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, etc. are correctly implemented. This may involve checking the conditions for each case and adjusting the logic to accurately determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```
