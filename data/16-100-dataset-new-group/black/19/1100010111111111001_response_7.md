The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that in some cases, the `newlines` and `before` variables are not being handled correctly, which results in incorrect output. Additionally, the function lacks proper handling for the decorator condition, which results in an incorrect number of newlines being returned.

To fix the bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be updated to handle the cases mentioned above correctly. Additionally, the conditions for decorator handling need to be adjusted to return the expected number of newlines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the mentioned corrections, the corrected version of the function can now accurately differentiate the various cases and return the expected number of newlines and actions. The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
