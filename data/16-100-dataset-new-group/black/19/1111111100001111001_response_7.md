The buggy function incorrectly updates the `before` variable without considering whether the leaf is a decorator, def, or class. Additionally, in the case where the current line is a def, class, or decorator and it's a flow control, the incorrect number of empty lines may be returned.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Check the type of statement and whether it's a decorator, def, class, and modify the before variable accordingly.
2. Update the conditions for returning newlines and before variables based on the type of statement.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return (before or 1), 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
