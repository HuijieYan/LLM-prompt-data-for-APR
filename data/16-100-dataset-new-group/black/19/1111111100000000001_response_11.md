The `is_import` function called inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function refers to a Leaf type that is not defined in the code provided. If `leaf` is an instance of the `Leaf` class, it should be imported at the top of the file, or if it is a different type, it should be explicitly imported and defined. 

Also, there are several references to attributes and methods, such as `current_line.depth`, `current_line.leaves`, `current_line.is_decorator`, `self.previous_defs`, `self.previous_line`, `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield` and `self.previous_line.is_import` that are not declared or initialized within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function or the `EmptyLineTracker` class. These should be either declared as class attributes or passed as arguments to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function references several undefined attributes and methods. This may lead to errors if these attributes and methods are not properly defined before being used within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to declare and initialize all the required attributes and methods of the `current_line` and `self` objects that are being used within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Additionally, any external functions or types used within the function should be properly imported and defined.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line, previous_line: Optional[Line] = None, previous_defs: List[int] = []) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while previous_defs and previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            previous_defs.append(depth)
        if previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if previous_line and previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        previous_line
        and previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        previous_line
        and previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Note that the `previous_line` and `previous_defs` parameters are provided as arguments to the function, and the unqualified references to `self` have been replaced with the appropriate parameters. Additionally, the `Line` type should be properly imported and defined at the top of the file.
