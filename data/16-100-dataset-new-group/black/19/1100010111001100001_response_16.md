The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is causing the failing tests. The function is expected to return a tuple of two integers, but the behavior of some conditional statements within the function is incorrect.

The bugs are present in the following parts:
1. The conditional statements that check for `is_decorator` or `is_def` or `is_class` are not functioning as intended. The logic for appending to the `previous_defs` list within these conditions is not consistent and may be causing unwanted mutation of the list.
2. The logic for determining the number of newlines to return is incorrect, as it does not consider all conditions appropriately.
3. There are inconsistencies in how the `max_allowed` value is being assigned within the function.

To fix the bug, you should consider reevaluating the conditional statements and their logic to ensure correct behavior, as well as revising the logic for determining the number of newlines to return. Additionally, ensure that the `max_allowed` value is appropriately set based on the conditions and requirements.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if not (current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class):
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if not current_line.is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    return newlines, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions and logic are appropriately handled to return the expected tuple of integers.
