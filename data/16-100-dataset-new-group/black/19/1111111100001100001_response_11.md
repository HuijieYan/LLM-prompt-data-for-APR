In the given buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`, it appears to take a `current_line` object and attempts to update several attributes and return two integers.

### Identified issues:
1. `current_line` attributes (`is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, `is_yield`) seem to be boolean flags denoting the type of the current line. However, within the function, these attributes are accessed using `current_line` instance instead of invoking the accompanying methods.
2. Currently, for the first bug, there is an inconsistency in accessing the aforementioned boolean flags as instance variables instead of invoking the accompanying methods.
3. Within the function, it appears to lack the context of why certain attributes are being modified such as `before` and `first_leaf.prefix`.

### Suggestions for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the following changes seem to be relevant:
1. Use the methods like `current_line.is_decorator()`, `current_line.is_def()`, etc., to access the boolean flags within the current line object.
2. Understand the context of modifying attributes such as `before` and `first_leaf.prefix`, and ensure that these changes are handled correctly.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator():
        if not current_line.is_decorator():
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control():
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, it assumes that `current_line` object's methods such as `is_decorator()`, `is_def()`, and others will return boolean values based on the condition checks made by the function. This is consistent with the expectation that these methods will provide the correct type of the current line. Additionally, no changes are made to the way `before` and `first_leaf.prefix` are modified as it has to be previously handled correctly.
