Based on the runtime and expected values provided, it seems the bug is related to the calculation of the `newlines` variable near the end of the function. This part seems to incorrectly calculate the value of `newlines` depending on the depth of the current_line. Also, the handling of different conditions and the value of `before` seems to be incorrect based on the expected results.

To fix the bug, a new logic needs to be applied to calculate the value of `newlines` and update the computation of `before` based on different conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth

    # Update the handling of different conditions
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 1 if depth else 2
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            newlines = 0
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    # Update the handling of flow control and import conditions
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
        
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the calculation of `newlines` is updated, and the conditions for handling decorators, imports, and flow control are improved to align with the expected results.
