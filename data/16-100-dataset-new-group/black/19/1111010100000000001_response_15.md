## Analysis
The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines` which is intended to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function performs various checks on the `current_line` to determine the number of empty lines.

## Identified potential error locations
1. In the segment `before = 1 if depth else 2`, it is unclear if the intention here is to check if `depth` is truthy or not.
2. The logic for `newlines` calculation seems to be incorrect and may not always return the expected result.
3. The conditions for `is_import` and `is_yield` checks may not be correctly evaluated in all cases.

## Cause of the bug
The buggy function contains conditional logic that checks different attributes of the `current_line` and previous lines to determine the number of empty lines. The bug is caused by incorrect logic in these conditions, specifically in the `before = 1 if depth else 2` and `newlines` calculation segments, which may cause incorrect results to be returned.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Review and correct the logical errors in the conditional statements.
2. Ensure that the conditions are properly evaluated and the correct number of empty lines is returned for each case.
