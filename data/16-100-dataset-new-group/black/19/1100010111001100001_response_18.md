The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be occurring due to incorrect handling of the `before` variable, which determines the number of empty lines to be inserted.

The bug is particularly highlighted in Case 8, where `before` is being set to `0` despite `max_allowed` being `1` inside the block: `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:`. This leads to an incorrect return value in the subsequent condition checks.

Additionally, there is a risk of incorrect logic in the conditional blocks. In some cases, the number of newlines to be inserted is being incorrectly set, leading to wrong output, as observed in other cases as well.

To fix the bug, we need to review the conditional blocks and ensure the correct logic for setting the `newlines` and `before` variables.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrections involve making sure that the `before` variable is appropriately set in all cases and that the conditional blocks have the correct logic based on the requirements specified. With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing tests.

Let me know if there is anything else that I can help you with.
