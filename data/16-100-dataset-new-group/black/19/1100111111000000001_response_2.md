The potential errors in the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` could be in the logic that determines when to return values for `newlines` and `0`. The conditions for `if` statements should be carefully checked to ensure they are working as intended.

The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect logic in the `if` statements that check for different line types, such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields. These conditions may not be properly handling the various scenarios that can occur within a line of code, leading to incorrect outputs for `newlines` and `0`.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve carefully reviewing the logic within each `if` statement and making sure that the conditions are properly adhering to the requirements for determining when to return `newlines` and `0`. Also, it might be useful to review the related functions such as `is_decorator`, `is_import`, `is_class`, `is_def`, `is_flow_control`, and `is_yield` to ensure that they are correctly providing the needed information.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(current_line)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions within the `if` statements are reviewed and updated. The calls to related functions such as `is_import` and `is_yield` are also modified to ensure they are returning the correct information. This should address the potential errors and fix the bug.
