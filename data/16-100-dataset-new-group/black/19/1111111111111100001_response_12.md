The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method is causing the failing test. The function is not correctly handling the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. By analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables inside the buggy function, we can identify the potential error locations and their causes.

In Case 1, when the `is_decorator` flag is True, it leads to the section of code that returns `newlines, 0`. This is inconsistent with our expectations.

The issue is likely related to how the variable `is_decorator` is being used. Instead of only using the `is_decorator` flag directly, the function should check if the current line is a decorator and rely on that conditional check to set the `is_decorator` variable correctly.

The fix involves modifying the way `is_decorator` is checked and setting `is_decorator` based on the conditional logic. This may involve using a conditional statement to determine if the current line is a decorator and updating `is_decorator` accordingly. Once this condition is set correctly, the logic for deciding the number of newlines will be correct.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.leaves and current_line.leaves[0].type in {DECORATOR}
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.leaves and self.previous_line.leaves[0].type in {DECORATOR}:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.leaves
        and self.previous_line.leaves[0].type in {IMPORT}
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.leaves
        and self.previous_line.leaves[0].type in {YIELD}
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this version, the `is_decorator` variable is set based on the type of the first leaf's type in the `current_line`. Also, I set a few checks based on the leaf type, just so it provides more specific code and readability. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
