The bug in the function _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int] seems to be related to the logic for inserting empty new lines. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. The failing test "test_comment_in_decorator" suggests that there might be an issue with inserting empty lines before decorators or within decorators.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the conditions used to determine the number of new lines to be inserted before the current line.

In the buggy function, there are multiple conditional blocks that determine the number of new lines to be inserted, such as conditions for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields. The buggy function fails to handle the scenario where a comment is present within a decorator.

To fix the bug, a suggested strategy would be to specifically handle the scenario where a comment is present within a decorator. This might involve checking for comments within decorators and adjusting the logic for inserting empty lines accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        # Check for comments within decorators
        if "#" in current_line.prefix:
            return 1, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I added a check for comments within decorators. If a comment is found within a decorator, the function will return 1 new line before the current line and 0 new lines after the current line.

This correction should address the bug identified in the failing test "test_comment_in_decorator" and ensure that the function correctly handles the scenario with comments within decorators.
