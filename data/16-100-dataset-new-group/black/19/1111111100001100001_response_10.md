The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by incorrect handling of the `depth` and `previous_defs` variables when determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. These variables are used to track the depth of the current line and the previous definitions encountered.

The bug is primarily due to the incorrect logic when handling the `depth` and `previous_defs` variables. The current implementation is not accurately maintaining the previous definitions and their respective depths, which leads to incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the `depth` and `previous_defs` variables are updated and tracked correctly when processing the lines. Additionally, the conditional checks for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, and other attributes need to be reviewed to properly calculate the number of empty lines required.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves and current_line.leaves[0].prefix:
        before = current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        current_line.leaves[0].prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the depth check and the handling of `previous_defs` have been updated to properly maintain the previous definitions and their depths. Additionally, the conditional checks and calculations for the number of empty lines have been adjusted to accurately determine the required empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
