The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears to be part of a code formatter, which considers the previous and current line to determine whether to insert empty lines. The function takes a current line object as input and returns a tuple of integers.

The error message from the failing test indicates a formatting difference between the expected and actual output of the code formatter.

The bug in the function might be related to how it handles empty lines in certain situations, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted code.

To fix the bug, the function should be carefully analyzed for its logic and any potential areas where it may not be handling empty lines correctly. It's possible that the function may not be correctly identifying the need for empty lines or improperly adjusting the number of empty lines based on certain conditions.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve reviewing the logic for adding empty lines in different code constructs, such as decorators, flow control statements, imports, etc. and ensuring that the function's behavior aligns with the expected formatting rules.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import 
          and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield 
          and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version refactors the handling of decorators and checks for various conditions to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted. It also revises the logic for adding empty lines before imports and yields to address the bug.
