To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that it returns the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. We will look at the returned values and types of relevant variables in the expected test cases for this function.

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is as follows:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class Leaf:
    pass

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: list
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: list

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Set max allowed empty lines based on the current line's depth
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines
        before = min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        current_line.leaves[0].prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if not current_line.is_decorator:
        # If the line is not a decorator, track the previous definitions
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

    if self.previous_line:
        if (
            not current_line.is_decorator
            and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        ):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

With the update to the function, the corrected version should now pass all the expected input/output values for the relevant test cases.
