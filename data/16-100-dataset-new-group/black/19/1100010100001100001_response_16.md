The bug in the provided function lies in the section that handles `self.previous_defs`. The implementation of the logic doesn't appear to handle the `depth` correctly, and the popping of elements from `self.previous_defs` doesn't consider the conditions that are being evaluated. There are also inconsistencies between the different conditions in the return statements. 

A potential strategy to fix the bug:
1. Ensure that `self.previous_defs` is handled correctly for different depths.
2. Verify that popping from `self.previous_defs` is done based on different conditions.
3. Address the inconsistencies between the return statements and ensure they are logically consistent based on the input conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        popped_depth = self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if popped_depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
``` 

In the corrected version, I've added a check to ensure that the popping from `self.previous_defs` is done based on the condition `popped_depth` being evaluated against the `depth`. Additionally, I've restructured the logic for return statements so that they are consistent and logical based on the input conditions.
