The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines before and after certain types of lines, such as imports, decorators, and flow control statements. The error message from the failing test indicates a specific mismatch in the expected and actual output of formatting, possibly due to incorrect handling of empty lines.

The potential error locations within the function could be the conditional statements that calculate the number of newlines to be inserted before and after different types of lines. It seems that the algorithm for determining the number of empty lines is not producing the expected result, leading to a formatting mismatch.

The cause of the bug could be due to conditional statements not properly handling different scenarios, such as decorators, imports, and flow control statements. Additionally, the algorithm for handling empty lines depending on the previous and current line types might need adjustments.

To fix the bug, it's important to carefully review the conditional statements and the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after different types of lines. Refactoring the logic to handle various scenarios more accurately and consistently should address the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statements for handling different line types, imports, decorators, and flow control statements have been adjusted to ensure consistent and accurate handling of empty lines before and after each type of line. This should address the formatting mismatch and resolve the bug.
