Looking at the provided code and the failing test case, several potential issues can be identified in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. The handling of `is_import` and `is_yield` functions and their corresponding conditions seem to be incorrect.
2. The way `previous_defs` list is manipulated and used can lead to incorrect results.

Based on the error message, failing test, and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue with the buggy function is primarily related to the handling of different line types, particularly `is_yield`, `is_import`, and decorators.

A strategy to fix the bug involves:
1. Correct handling and checks for `is_import`, `is_yield` and decorator types.
2. Proper manipulation and utilization of `previous_defs` list.
3. Ensuring that the correct number of newlines are returned based on the conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The updated function modifies the handling of `is_import`, `is_yield`, and decorators. It also fixes the manipulation of `previous_defs` list to ensure proper handling of line types and conditions.

This updated version should address the issues identified and ensure that the failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator` now passes.
