The bug in the provided function is likely causing the failing tests due to incorrect logic in calculating the number of empty lines to be inserted.

On analyzing the cases, it can be seen that the issue lies in the logic where the function calculates the number of empty lines to return. The function seems to be incorrectly updating the `before` and `newlines` variables based on the conditions it checks.

Given the provided input, the following strategy can be used to fix the bug:
- Address the incorrect conditional logic for updating `before` and `newlines` based on different scenarios.
- Revise the conditions and the variables being updated based on the defined function requirements.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""  # Remove extra newlines
    
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
