The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing incorrect behavior as per the runtime input and output variable values provided. The bug is likely present in the conditional logic that sets the `before` variable within the while loop.

The `before` variable is re-assigned within the `while` loop whenever `self.previous_defs` contains non-zero values. This results in the value of `before` being constantly overwritten regardless of the depth or other conditions, causing incorrect outputs.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic within the `while` loop for updating the `before` variable should be modified to consider the depth and possibly introduce additional conditions to better control the value assigned to `before`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the while loop updates the `before` variable based on the depth value, and additional conditions are added to handle different cases more precisely.

Note: The exact logic and conditions might need further adjustments based on the desired behavior and more comprehensive testing.
