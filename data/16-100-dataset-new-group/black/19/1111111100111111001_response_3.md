The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` provided seems to have some errors in terms of accessing the values and using them in the subsequent operations. The incorrect values and types at the function's return indicate an issue with how the logic is being applied, notably the `before` and `newlines` variables. 

The common issue appears to be the incorrect assignments of these variables and the condition checks inside the function, leading to incorrect results. The function is also closely dependant on the values of other methods from the same file.

In order to fix the bug, it is likely necessary to modify the assignment process and the condition checks to ensure the correct values are derived.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if not current_line.leaves:
        before = 0
    else:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the incorrect assignments of `before` and `newlines` variables and also modifies the condition checks based on the expected behavior as per the failing and expected test cases. After applying these changes, the corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values.
