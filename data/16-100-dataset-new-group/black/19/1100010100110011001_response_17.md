The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes in a `current_line` object and returns a tuple of two integers. It seems that the function is not correctly determining the number of empty lines to be returned in certain cases.

The potential error locations within the function include:
1. The first `if` statement that calculates the `max_allowed` value.
2. The logic that handles the `current_line.leaves` and updates `before`.
3. The checks for various line types and their corresponding returns.

The cause of the bug could be a conditional structure that is not appropriately handling the various cases, leading to incorrect empty line calculations. One strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review the conditional statements and the logic within each code block to ensure that they accurately capture the intended cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Initialize max_allowed based on current_line.depth
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
      
    # Handling the case when leaves are present
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
      
    # Check various line types and return empty line counts
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
            
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```

With the corrected function, the expected input/output values for all cases should be satisfied.
