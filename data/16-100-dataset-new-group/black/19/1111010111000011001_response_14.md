The issue with the buggy function is due to the incorrect modification of the `before` variable within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Additionally, it seems that the conditional statements within the function might not be evaluating correctly.

To fix this, we need to make sure that the modifications to `before` are consistent and that the conditional statements properly handle the different cases based on the current line's properties.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we first initialize `before` to 0 to handle the cases where the `leaves` list is empty. We then use the `min` function to correctly update the `before` value based on the count of newlines in the `prefix` of the first leaf. We also adjusted the conditional statements and return values based on the expected behavior.

With these changes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now produce the correct results and pass the failing test cases.
