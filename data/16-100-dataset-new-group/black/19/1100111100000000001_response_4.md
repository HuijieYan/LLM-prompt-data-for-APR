The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears to have a few issues that need to be addressed. Here are the identified potential error locations and their causes:
1. The `is_decorator`, `is_import`, `is_class`, `is_def`, `is_flow_control`, and `is_yield` functions are called within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, but they are not defined within the given code snippet.
2. The condition `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth` within the while loop may cause an index out of range error if `self.previous_defs` is empty.

To fix the issues, the related missing functions (`is_decorator`, `is_import`, `is_class`, `is_def`, `is_flow_control`, and `is_yield`) need to be defined. Additionally, the while loop should be checked for the index out of range issue and handled accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    # Check for the length of self.previous_defs to avoid index out of range error
    while self.previous_defs and len(self.previous_defs) > 0 and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

It's important to define the missing functions (`is_decorator`, `is_import`, `is_class`, `is_def`, `is_flow_control`, and `is_yield`) and ensure that the condition in the while loop does not cause an index out of range error.
