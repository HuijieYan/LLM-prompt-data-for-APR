The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume the prefix of a string up to a certain column, and then return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. The function seems to have a bug where it fails to properly handle the indentation of comments.

The potential error locations within the function include the logic for handling indentation, tracking the current column, and the handling of newlines.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level when encountering a comment after a dedent. This behavior is causing the incorrect reformatting of comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, I would suggest reviewing the logic for handling the indentation, specifically focusing on how the function tracks the current column and how it handles the indentation of comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        indent_level = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    current_line = current_line.lstrip()
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    current_line = current_line.lstrip()
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = char
                current_column = 1
                indent_level = current_column

            if current_column >= column:
                break

        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

In the corrected version, I've added an `indent_level` variable to track the indentation level of the current line. I've also modified the logic for handling comments by checking if the current line begins with a comment symbol ('#') and adjusting its indentation accordingly.

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
