The bug in the given function is that the logic for updating the current line and processing the indentation level is incorrect. The function is not correctly identifying the prefix that partially matches the column width specified.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the for loop to correctly handle the cases for updating the current line and the indentation level. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the else block within the for loop is updated to handle the cases of space, tab, and newline to correctly track the current column value and update the wait_for_nl flag. Additionally, the condition for handling the case when the column width is partially consumed by prefix is updated to return the correct result.
