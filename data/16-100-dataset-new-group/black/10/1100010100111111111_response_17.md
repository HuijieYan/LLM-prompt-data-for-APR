Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior with tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is mishandling the indentation when encountering a comment after a dedent, resulting in inconsistent indentation of the comment.

The cause of the bug can be identified as the mishandling of indentation when encountering a comment after a dedent. This is evident from the runtime values and types of variables, especially in Case 1 and Case 3, which show inconsistent handling of indentation and comments.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation and comments. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function properly tracks and maintains the correct column position when encountering comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            if not current_line.strip():  # handle indentation after dedent
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_line += char  # accumulate spaces within the line
        elif char == '\t':
            if not current_line.strip():  # handle indentation after dedent
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char  # accumulate tabs within the line
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # add the completed line to lines
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char  # accumulate non-indentation characters
            wait_for_nl = True  # set wait_for_nl for non-indentation characters
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the mishandling of indentation and comments after a dedent by properly accumulating spaces and tabs within the line and adjusting the column position accordingly.

With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle tabulated comments after a dedent correctly and pass the failing test, thus resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
