To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to address the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. This is causing the failing test case due to incorrect indentation of comments.

Observations:
- The function is incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, leading to the incorrect output and failing test case.
- The logic for tracking the current indentation level is flawed, especially when encountering comments after a dedent.
- The function is not properly handling the case when a comment is encountered after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for tracking the current column and handling comments after a dedent, ensuring that the comments maintain the correct indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Adjusted condition for correct indentation comparison
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, satisfying the failing test case and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
