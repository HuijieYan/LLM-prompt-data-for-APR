The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and spaces for indentation. Based on the analysis of runtime and expected values, the function is not correctly handling the indentation of the prefix when encountering tab characters and spaces.

The function should keep track of the total indentation level of the prefix, considering both tabs and spaces, and then use this information to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column.

The bug causes incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue. To fix the bug, the function should properly handle indentation using tabs and spaces.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                # reset column count for other characters after newline
                if char != '\t' and char != ' ':
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the code ensures that the `current_column` is updated correctly based on the encountered characters, especially when handling tabs and spaces. This should address the issue with incorrect indentation of tabulated comments reported in the GitHub issue.
