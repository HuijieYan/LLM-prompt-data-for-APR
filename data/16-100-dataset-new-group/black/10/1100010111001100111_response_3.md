The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is not correctly handling the indentation and waiting for a new line after encountering a tab or space character.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level and waiting for a new line after encountering tab or space characters.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly track the current indentation level and wait for a new line after encountering tab or space characters. It should also handle the case where the prefix is empty, ensuring that the function can handle all possible input scenarios.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                # Check if the line needs to be processed
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Process the line
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This version of the function correctly handles the indentation level and waiting for a new line after encountering tab or space characters. It also properly processes the prefix and returns the expected result.

With the corrected function, the test_comment_indentation test function should now pass without any issues.
