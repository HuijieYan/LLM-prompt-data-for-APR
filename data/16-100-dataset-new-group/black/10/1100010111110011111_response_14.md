### Buggy Function Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is supposed to process the prefix of a string while keeping track of the current line and column, and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. The bug seems to lie in the logic of handling indentation and new lines, specifically when waiting for a new line.

### Identified Bug
The bug seems to be in the logic of handling indentation and new lines within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It is not correctly handling the indentation and new lines, which leads to incorrect results for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Bug Cause
The failing test `test_comment_indentation` calls the `_partially_consume_prefix` function with different prefixes containing tabulated and space-based indentation. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the indentation and new lines, leading to differing expected and actual results for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for handling indentation and new lines.
2. Ensure that tabulated comments after a dedent are indented correctly as per the test cases.
3. The function should accurately track the current line and indentation column.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now accurately handles indentation and new lines, ensuring correct processing of the prefix. This should resolve the issue with tabulated comments after a dedent and pass the failing test.
