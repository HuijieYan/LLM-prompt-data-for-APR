The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the input prefix string based on a given column number. The function seems to have a logic issue with handling tab characters, which is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to fail.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the logic for handling tab characters and the check for the column number while consuming the prefix string.

The cause of the bug is related to the mishandling of tab characters in the `prefix` string. The function doesn't properly account for the column position when encountering tab characters, which leads to incorrect indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling tab characters in the prefix string and adjust the column position based on the tabs encountered.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # calculate the number of spaces for the tab character
            current_line += ' ' * num_spaces
            current_column += num_spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this modification, the function now properly handles tab characters and adjusts the column position accordingly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and resolve the issue posted in GitHub about incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
