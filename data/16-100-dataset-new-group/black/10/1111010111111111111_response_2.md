The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior when processing tabulated comments. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation for comments after a dedent, which results in incorrect reformatting.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent and ensure that the comments are formatted correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should handle the tabulated comments and maintain the correct indentation after a dedent as expected. The failing test should pass with this corrected version.
