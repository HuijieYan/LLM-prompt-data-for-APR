The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a few issues:

1. It does not correctly handle the indentation level of a comment line.
2. It incorrectly keeps the comment line as part of the current line, resulting in the inconsistent indentation in the output.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly manage the indentation level after encountering a comment.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling comment lines and ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained for the comment.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add the current line to lines
            current_line = ""  # Reset current line
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the indentation and comment lines correctly, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values.
