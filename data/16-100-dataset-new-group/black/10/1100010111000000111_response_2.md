## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the tab character count based on the specified tab width
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Explanation and Fixing Strategy
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with tab characters and incorrect indentation calculation. The original implementation does not handle tab characters appropriately, leading to incorrect indentation results, which is the cause of the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix this issue, the tab character count needs to be adjusted based on the specified tab width. By modifying the logic for handling tab characters, the function can correctly calculate the indentation. The corrected version provided above addresses this issue and ensures that the function handles tab characters correctly, resolving the problem with incorrect indentation in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
