## Correction of the buggy function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)   # Move this line to here
            current_line = ""             # Set current line to empty for the next iteration
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After analyzing the function and its relationship with the error message, the expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, the cause of the bug is primarily due to incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, especially in cases where tab characters are used for indentation.

The bug is specifically related to the incorrect calculation of the number of spaces when encountering a tab character. This leads to the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent in the presence of tab characters in the input.

To fix the bug, the function's handling of tab characters needs to be updated to correctly calculate the number of spaces corresponding to a tab character.

The corrected function adjusts the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering a tab character to ensure that the correct number of spaces is added based on the existing indentation level. Additionally, the placement of lines.append(current_line) and current_line = "" has been adjusted to correctly handle newlines and the accumulation of lines.

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test, ensuring that the expected input/output values are met and resolving the issue posted on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
