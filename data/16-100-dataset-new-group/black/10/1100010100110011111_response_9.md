## Fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation and comments in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level when encountering comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect formatting, especially when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation and comments, ensuring that the formatting is preserved correctly.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, it should properly handle the indentation and comments, ensuring that the formatting is preserved correctly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and pass the failing test case.

Please note that the function should be tested with various input cases to ensure its correctness and complete functionality.
