The cause of the bug is within the if statement block that handles the condition `wait_for_nl`. When the condition is met and a new line character is encountered, if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than `column`, the function should concatenate all the lines that were appended to the `lines` list and return the result. However, it is wrongly appending `current_line` to `lines` instead of what it should have, leading to the incorrect output and the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to change the logic within the if statement block and properly append the lines to the `lines` list. Then the return statement should be updated to return the correct result and the remaining prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # append current_line to lines as well
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)  # append current_line to lines instead of lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
