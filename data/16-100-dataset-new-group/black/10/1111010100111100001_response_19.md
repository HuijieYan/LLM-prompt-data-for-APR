The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has several issues that need to be addressed. The function is expected to partially consume a string until a specific column position. However, the logic inside the function is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of newlines and indentation. The wait_for_nl flag is not being reset after consuming a newline character, causing the function to incorrectly identify the start of a new line.

To fix the bug, we need to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when consuming a newline character. We also need to handle correctly the indentation based on spaces and tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                if char != '\n':
                    current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issues with this function and pass the failing test.
