The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it incorrectly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent. This causes the indentation for comments to be changed incorrectly, especially when the input file uses tabs. The current implementation of the function does not correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent. This can be achieved by updating the logic within the function to accurately track the current column and handle tab characters (\t) appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly handles tabs and maintains the correct indentation for comments after a dedent. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the incorrect change in indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
