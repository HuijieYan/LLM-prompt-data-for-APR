The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function appears to be related to the logic for handling whitespace and newlines while building up `current_line` and `lines`. The function is designed to consume a prefix up to a specified column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining unparsed prefix.

The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a newline character and the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to True, but it fails to properly handle this case and update the state variables (`current_column`, `current_line`, `wait_for_nl`, `lines`) accordingly. This results in incomplete or incorrect parsing of the prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where a newline character is encountered, and updates the state variables appropriately. This involves properly resetting `current_column`, `current_line`, and `wait_for_nl` when encountering a newline, and adding the `current_line` to `lines` when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                break
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                break
    return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
```

This corrected version ensures that the state variables are appropriately updated when encountering whitespace and newline characters, and that the prefix is correctly consumed up to the specified column.
