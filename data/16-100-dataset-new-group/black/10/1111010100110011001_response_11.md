The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is expected to process a prefix string by consuming part of it while keeping track of the current line, column, and other variables. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and new line characters.

The main potential error location within the function is the logic for processing the characters in the `prefix` string, including handling spaces, tabs, and new lines.

The issue with the current implementation is that the function fails to correctly process the indentation and new line characters, leading to incorrect outcomes.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately handle indentation and new line characters, keep track of the correct current line, and correctly identify the start of a new line.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)  # Add the current line along with the new line character
                current_line = ""  # Reset the current line
                current_column = 0  # Reset the current column
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if current_column < column and current_line.strip():  # Check if the indentation is finished
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By using this updated implementation, the function should now correctly process the prefix string and produce the expected outputs for the given test cases.
