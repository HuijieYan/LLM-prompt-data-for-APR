To fix the bug, we need to address the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that handles the indentation and newline characters. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles the indentation when encountering a comment after a dedent.

The main problem is that the function incorrectly handles the indentation after a dedent, causing the comment to be misaligned when compared to the next line.

To address the bug, we can modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation when encountering a comment after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we've added an additional check when encountering a newline character. If the current line starts with a comment, we append it to the list of lines. This ensures that comments after a dedent are properly handled and maintain the correct indentation.

This change should address the bug and ensure that the comments are aligned correctly after a dedent.

After applying this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values. Additionally, this change should also resolve the issue posted in GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
