Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The logic for handling tabs and their corresponding column increments.
2. The condition for checking if a character is a new line and whether the indentation is finished.

Cause of the bug using the buggy function and GitHub Issue information:
The bug appears to be related to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. This aligns with the function _partially_consume_prefix, which is responsible for processing the input and handling indentation.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles tab characters and their corresponding column increments. Additionally, the condition for checking new lines and determining if the indentation is finished needs to be adjusted to align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]

                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    # unexpected empty line
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
