The cause of the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is that it doesn't handle the indentation of comments correctly, especially when using tabs. This leads to incorrect behavior when reformatting code that contains tabulated comments at a depth greater than 0.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic within the _partially_consume_prefix function to properly handle the indentation of comments, especially when using tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    found_comment = False  # track if a comment is found
    indent = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if found_comment:  # adjust the indent of the comment
                    if char == '#':
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        lines[-1] = lines[-1].lstrip()
                        lines[-1] = ' ' * indent + lines[-1]
                        found_comment = False
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            found_comment = False
        elif char == '#':  # handle comments
            wait_for_nl = True
            indent = current_column  # record the current column as the comment indent
            found_comment = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            found_comment = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the _partially_consume_prefix function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments, regardless of whether tabs or spaces are used. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Please note that this correction assumes the presence of a helper function `fs` for formatting strings and the `assertFormatEqual` function for testing. These are not provided in the snippet and may need to be sourced from the original code.
