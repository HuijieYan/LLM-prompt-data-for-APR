## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if wait_for_nl:
            current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function was caused by the mishandling of the "wait_for_nl" condition and the addition of the current line to the "lines" list. The "wait_for_nl" condition was not being checked properly, and the current line was not being added to the "lines" list when encountering a newline character.

The corrected version of the function fixes these issues by properly handling the "wait_for_nl" condition and appending the current line to the "lines" list when encountering a newline character.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It resolves the issue posted in GitHub where the indentation was incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent.
