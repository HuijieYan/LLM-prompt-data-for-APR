The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely the cause of the failing test. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix based on a specified column value, but it appears to have issues with handling the indentation and comments.

The issues occur because the function does not correctly handle the indentation and comments when consuming the prefix. It fails to properly evaluate and adjust the lines and current_column values.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling whitespace characters and comments, ensuring that the function correctly identifies the appropriate indentation levels and handles comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the prefix properly, correctly identifying the indentation levels and handling comments. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values as well as resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
