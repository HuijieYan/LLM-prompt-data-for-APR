## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function lies in the condition for handling '\n'. When a newline character is encountered, the current_line and current_column values need to be checked and updated before continuing with processing the prefix. Otherwise, incorrect values are being returned, leading to the failing tests.

The corrected version of the function includes the necessary checks for current_line and current_column when encountering a newline character, ensuring that the processing is done correctly and the expected output is returned.

This correction addresses the reported issue on GitHub and ensures that the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent is handled correctly.
