The bug in the function is that it does not correctly handle the case where the column number is greater than the length of the prefix. This causes the function to return incorrect values for `res` and the remaining prefix.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to check if the current column is greater than or equal to the specified column number before checking for a newline character. If it is greater, then we should return the current lines accumulated so far and the remaining prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version checks for the current column being greater than or equal to the specified column number before accumulating the lines and returning the result. It also correctly handles the cases where a newline character is encountered.
