Based on the identified issues and expected values, here are the problems and the corrected function:

1. The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where the prefix ends before reaching the specified column.
2. There is an issue with resetting `current_column` when encountering a new line character.
3. `wait_for_nl` is not properly updated when encountering a non-tab, non-space character.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function should now satisfy all the identified issues and expected input/output values.
