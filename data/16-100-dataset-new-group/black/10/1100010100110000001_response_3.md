The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation of comments correctly, as seen from the failing test error message. When comparing the expected and actual outputs, there is a difference related to the comment indentation.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments within the prefix. It fails to skip the whitespace and place the comment in the correct indentation.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to adjust the function to correctly handle the indentation of comments by skipping whitespace and placing the comment at the correct indentation level.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
