Based on the buggy function, the issue seems to be with the logic for handling indentation and new lines. It looks like there's a problem with detecting the end of the indentation block and waiting for a new line.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect logic in the elif condition `elif char == '\n':`, where it should be handling the case where the newline character is encountered. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with how the `current_line` and `wait_for_nl` variables are handled.

To fix the bug, you should modify the condition `elif char == '\n':` to correctly handle the logic when a newline character is encountered, and ensure that the `current_line` and `wait_for_nl` variables are updated appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function should now appropriately handle the indentation and new line logic to produce the expected output for all the provided test cases.
