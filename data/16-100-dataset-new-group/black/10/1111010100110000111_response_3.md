### Bug Analysis:
The `Driver` class contains a buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` which is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This bug is also mentioned in the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent." The error message from the failing test indicates that the incorrect indentation is causing the test to fail.

### Error Locations:
The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the handling of tabs, spaces, and newlines, specifically in the `wait_for_nl` condition and the logic for updating `current_column` and `current_line`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of indentation levels and newlines in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering tabs and newlines, the function does not appropriately update the `current_column` and `current_line`, resulting in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The strategy for fixing the bug involves revisiting the logic for updating `current_column` and `current_line` when encountering tabs, spaces, and newlines. Properly handling these cases will ensure that the function maintains the correct indentation levels and correctly processes newlines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue  # Added to continue processing the next character
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjusted indentation for tabs, using 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column and wait_for_nl if encountering a newline
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # Reset current_column and wait_for_nl if encountering a non-space, non-tab character
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function takes into account the correct handling of tabs, spaces, and newlines to ensure proper indentation processing. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
