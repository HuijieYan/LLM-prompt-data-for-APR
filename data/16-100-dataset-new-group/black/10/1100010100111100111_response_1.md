Based on the provided information, the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function stems from incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent. The function fails to properly preserve the indentation level of the comments, resulting in incorrect formatting.

The root cause of the bug is related to how the function processes indentation levels and new lines, specifically with regard to tab characters. This leads to incorrect identification of the expected indentation level for comments, resulting in the formatting issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the indentation level and handle tab characters appropriately in order to preserve the correct formatting, especially for comments after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Tab width is 8
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of tab characters has been modified to ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained. The tab width is set to 8, and the calculation for adjusting the current column with tabs is included.

This corrected version of the function should address the indentation issue and preserve the correct formatting for comments after a dedent. It should pass the failing test and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
