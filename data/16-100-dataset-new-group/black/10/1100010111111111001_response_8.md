To fix the buggy function, we need to review how it handles the indentation of comments and whitespace characters such as spaces and tabs in the input code. The current implementation does not correctly handle the conversion of tab characters to spaces and the indentation of comment lines.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the indentation of comments in the input code. The comments are not aligned correctly with the indentation of the surrounding code, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to correctly handle the indentation of comments and convert tab characters to spaces in a consistent manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we handle the tab characters by converting them to spaces and adjusting the column count accordingly. We also ensure that the indentations for comments are consistent with the surrounding code.

With these changes, the function should correctly handle the input code, and the failing test cases should pass.
