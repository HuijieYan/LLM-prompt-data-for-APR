The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` causes the function to not properly handle certain cases where the input prefix contains spaces and tabs. This results in incorrect output for different scenarios, including adding empty lines to the `lines` list and not correctly updating the `current_column` value.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle spaces, tabs, and newlines. Specifically, when encountering a newline character, the function should check if the current line meets the column requirement. If not, the characters in the line should be added to the `lines` list, and the `current_line` and `current_column` values should be reset.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```
