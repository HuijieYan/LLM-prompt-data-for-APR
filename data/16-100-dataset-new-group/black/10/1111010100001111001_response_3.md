The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical error that causes it to return incorrect results.

The issue is that when the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to True, the function checks if the current character is a newline. If it is, the function properly clears `current_line` and resets `current_column`. However, if the current character is anything other than a newline, the function does not reset `current_line` and `current_column`, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this bug, we need to reset `current_line` and `current_column` whenever the function encounters a character that is not a newline while the `wait_for_nl` flag is true.

Here's the fixed version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the fixed version, we added the `current_line = ""` and `current_column = 0` statements in the else block, which resets the values of `current_line` and `current_column` when the condition to reset them is met.

This fixed function should now return the expected results for all the provided cases.
