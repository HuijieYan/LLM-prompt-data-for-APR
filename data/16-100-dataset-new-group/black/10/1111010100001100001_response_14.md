The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle prefix lines that are longer than the specified column. When the prefix line exceeds the specified column, it does not return the correct prefix and the remaining suffix.

To fix the bug, we need to track the total length of the line, including spaces and tabs, and ensure that we return the correct prefix and suffix based on the specified column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adds a check after encountering a newline character to see if the line exceeds the specified column. If it does, it immediately returns the correct prefix and suffix. If not, it continues processing the prefix until the entire prefix is consumed.

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle cases where the prefix line exceeds the specified column and return the correct prefix and suffix.
