### Correction

The issue with the original code is that it fails to properly handle the situation when the indentation ends and the line continues without any more leading whitespace.

To fix this, we need to adjust the condition for when we are waiting for a new line after the indentation ends. We'll check if the current character is a newline, and if it is, we'll check if the next line starts with more indentation or not. If it does, we'll wait for the newline, and if it doesn't, we'll consider the line to be fully consumed and return the consumed portion.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                # indent is finished
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This version addresses the issue of consuming the prefix up to the specified column and correctly handles the situation when the indentation ends. It is designed to satisfy the expected input/output values and should pass the failing test.
