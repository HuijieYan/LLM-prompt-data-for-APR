The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` variable, leading to an unexpected indentation shift in the output. To fix this bug, we need to re-evaluate the logic for processing the input `prefix` and updating the `current_line`, `lines`, and `current_column` variables.

In this function, whenever a newline character is encountered, the code is handling the indentation incorrectly, resulting in a discrepancy between the expected and actual output.

The bug can be fixed by resetting the `current_column` to 0 whenever a newline character is encountered. Additionally, we need to ensure that the indentation level is correctly updated when tabs or spaces are encountered. The `wait_for_nl` variable should also be modified to control the logic for tracking indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and return the expected output for the failing test cases.
