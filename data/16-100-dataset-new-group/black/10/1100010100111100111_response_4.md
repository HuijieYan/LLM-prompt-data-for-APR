The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic issue that causes incorrect behavior when processing the input prefix string. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix string based on the specified column, but it fails to properly handle the indentation of comments.

The issue is due to the `wait_for_nl` flag not being properly reset when encountering a newline character, causing the function to incorrectly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the `wait_for_nl` flag should be reset to `False` when encountering a newline character. Additionally, the logic for processing comments and indentation should be adjusted to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset the flag and column count for newline
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the corrected function should handle the indentation of comments correctly and pass the failing test, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
