The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has issues with correctly handling the indentation of comments in the input `prefix` string. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix based on the provided `column`. However, it fails to handle the indentation of comments, resulting in incorrect output. The bug is likely in the logic that handles white spaces, tabs, newlines, and wait for newline.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to implement separate logic for handling comments and indentation, ensuring that the function accurately consumes the prefix based on the provided column value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column >= column:
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version modifies the logic to correctly handle the indentation and partial consumption of the prefix string based on the provided column value. It no longer uses the `wait_for_nl` flag and processes each character to determine the current indentation level. This version should now pass the failing test.
