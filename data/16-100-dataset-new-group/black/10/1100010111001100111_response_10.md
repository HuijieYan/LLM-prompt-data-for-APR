The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with handling the indentation of comments in the input code. This issue is related to the GitHub problem titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent".

The problem occurs when the input code contains tab indentation and a comment is present after a dedent. The function modifies the comment's indentation in the output, which is incorrect.

The specific cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. As a result, the comment indentation is modified in the output, leading to the failing test case provided.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function preserves the original indentation of comments in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column == 0 or current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected function, the `elif char == '\n'` condition has been modified to check if the comment has started in the previous line. If so, it preserves the indentation of the comment. This change ensures that the original comment indentation is maintained in the output, resolving the bug.

With this corrected function, the failing test case for comment indentation should pass, and the issue reported in the GitHub problem should be resolved.
