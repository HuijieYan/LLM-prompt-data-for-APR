The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to incorrectly handling the indentation level when encountering comments after a dedent. The function is not correctly preserving the indentation level for comments, resulting in incorrect reformatting of the code when using tabs.

Based on the analysis of the failing test, runtime input/output values, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, the cause of the bug appears to be the mishandling of the `wait_for_nl` condition and the incorrect update of the `current_column` when encountering comments.

To fix the bug, the strategy is to revise the logic for tracking the `current_column` and properly handle the indentation level for comments. Additionally, the function should correctly handle multiple lines of code with tabs and comments to ensure that the indentation is preserved.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected function, the condition for updating `current_column` when encountering a tab character has been fixed to correctly handle the indentation level. Additionally, the condition for checking the indentation level for comments has been updated to use `len(current_line.expandtabs())` to account for the expansion of tabs to spaces.

With these corrections, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the indentation of comments correctly and pass the failing test while preserving the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation in the presence of comments after a dedent.
