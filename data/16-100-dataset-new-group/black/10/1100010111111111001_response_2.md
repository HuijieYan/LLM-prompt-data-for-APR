The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to generate an assertion error. Based on the runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values, the problem in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to arise from the incorrect handling of indentation.

The bug is likely caused by the `wait_for_nl` condition not being properly reset in all cases, leading to incorrect behavior when handling indentation and newlines. This causes the function to fail when trying to consume the prefix and handle the comment indentation correctly.

To fix the bug, the handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition and its interaction with other conditions needs to be reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix and correctly handles the indentation and comments.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = True  # Reset wait_for_nl to True at the beginning
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0  # Reset current_column to 0 when a newline is encountered
                wait_for_nl = True  # Set wait_for_nl to True after encountering a newline
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False  # Set wait_for_nl to False after finishing the indentation
                current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should now pass, as the function is expected to correctly consume the prefix and handle the comment indentation.
