The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior when it encounters tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is not handling the indentations properly, resulting in incorrectly changed indentation for the comments.

The potential error location within the function is the logic for handling tabulated comments and tracking the current column position.

The bug is caused by the function not correctly identifying and handling tabulated comments after a dedent, which leads to incorrect indentation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tabulated comments and ensure that the indentation is maintained correctly, especially after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                if current_column % 4 == 0:  # Fixed tab indentation
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    current_column += 1  # Handle non-multiple of 4 tab indentation
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle tabulated comments and maintain the correct indentation, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
