The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing indentation issues when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent. The `test_comment_indentation` test case is failing because the `assertFormatEqual` is comparing two strings and getting an AssertionError due to incorrect indentation.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the tabulated comments correctly after a dedent. It is not preserving the original tabulation when dealing with comments, causing incorrect indentation in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent. This can be achieved by ensuring that the tabulation is correctly maintained when processing comments and handling the dedent and indentations properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent = 0  # Track the current level of indentation
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                indent = 0  # Reset the indentation level after a newline
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            indent += 1  # Increment the indentation level for spaces
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (indent % 4)  # Adjust the column based on the current indentation level
            indent = 0  # Reset the indentation level for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            indent = 0  # Reset the indentation level for a newline
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent and maintain the original tabulation. This should resolve the indentation issue for tabulated comments reported in the GitHub issue.
