The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior when handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. This bug is leading to a failing test related to the incorrect handling of comments after a dedent.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the logic for handling indentation and newlines.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level and waiting for a new line when encountering a comment. This results in incorrect behavior when processing the prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation level and newlines, especially when encountering comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue  # Skip processing other conditions until newline is encountered
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the wait_for_nl flag
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly handles indentation levels and newlines, addressing the bug that caused the failing test. The function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
