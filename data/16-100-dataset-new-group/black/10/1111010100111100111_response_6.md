To fix this bug, we need to address the issue where comments are incorrectly reindented after a dedent in the input file using tabs. This is related to the function `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class in the file `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`.

The cause of the bug is related to the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is responsible for consuming a prefix until a certain column is reached, and it fails to correctly handle the scenario of comments following an indentation change.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle indentation changes and comments. Specifically, we need to check for the presence of a comment after an indentation change and adjust the processing accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # adjust column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        if current_column >= column and '#' in current_line:
            break
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function will properly consume the prefix while correctly handling indentation changes and comments. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that comments are not incorrectly reindented after a dedent.
