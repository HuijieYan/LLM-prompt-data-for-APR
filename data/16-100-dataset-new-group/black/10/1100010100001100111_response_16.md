The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string based on the given column, but it has a bug that causes it to incorrectly handle the indentation of comments. This bug is related to the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the indentation of comments when the input file uses tabs. It fails to properly track the indentation level and position of comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation adjustments when consuming the prefix string.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters and track the correct column position to maintain the original indentation of comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Handle tab characters
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I added a condition to handle tab characters, adjusted the current column position accordingly, and removed the unnecessary concatenation of the `current_line` in the tab character block. This should ensure that the function correctly tracks and maintains the original indentation of comments, as described in the GitHub issue.
