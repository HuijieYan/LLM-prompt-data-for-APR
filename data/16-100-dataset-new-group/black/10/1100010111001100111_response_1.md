The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the indentation to be incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is not handling tabulated comments properly after a dedent, which is causing the test case `test_comment_indentation` to fail.

The main cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The `wait_for_nl` variable is not being properly set, leading to improper handling of new lines with tabulated comments.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the tabulated comments after a dedent. We can modify the logic to properly track the indentation level and handle tabulated comments as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming tab width is 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # handling non-empty lines
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent and pass the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`.
