## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check if the line is not empty
                if current_column < column:  # Check if the current column is less than the specified column
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function occurs when checking for unexpected empty lines. If an unexpected empty line is encountered, it resets the current column count to 0 but does not handle the line content correctly. This results in skipping parts of the prefix.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add a condition to check if the current line is not empty before processing the line.
2. Check if the current column is less than the specified column before returning the result.

The corrected version of the function includes these fixes, ensuring that the function handles unexpected empty lines and correctly determines the prefix to be consumed.

By making these adjustments, the function now correctly partially consumes the prefix according to the specified column.
