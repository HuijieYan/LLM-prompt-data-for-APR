Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing test, the issue seems to be related to the handling of whitespace characters and indentation in the "_partially_consume_prefix" function. It appears that the function is not correctly preserving the indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of the function does not properly handle the indentation and whitespace characters when consuming the prefix. This leads to incorrect results, especially when dealing with tab characters and comment indentation.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the indentation and whitespace characters, ensuring that the comments are indented correctly after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By enhancing the handling of whitespace characters and indentation, the corrected function should now preserve the correct indentation for comments after a dedent, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
