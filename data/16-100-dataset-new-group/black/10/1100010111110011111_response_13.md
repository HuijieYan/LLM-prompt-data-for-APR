To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, we need to address the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The issue seems to be related to the handling of whitespace characters and newlines, causing the indentation to be modified in an unexpected way.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for tracking the current column and handling whitespace characters and newlines. Specifically, we need to ensure that the indentation is maintained correctly, especially when encountering a comment after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Adjusted condition to include equal to column
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check if the current line is not empty
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0  # Reset column to 0 after newline
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the condition for checking the column value before returning the result. Additionally, we have included a check to handle a newline character and ensure that the indentation is reset correctly. These changes aim to address the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent.

With these corrections, the _partially_consume_prefix function should now produce the expected output for the failing test case, and address the issue reported on GitHub related to the incorrect indentation.
