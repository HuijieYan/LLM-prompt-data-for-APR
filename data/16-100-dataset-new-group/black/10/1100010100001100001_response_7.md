The bug in the given function is caused when the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True` after encountering an indentation and then waiting for a new line to signal the end of the indentation. However, after reaching the end of the line, the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset to `False` in all cases, which causes unexpected behavior in the subsequent iterations.

To fix the bug, we need to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` once we've found the end of the indentation or reached the end of the line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset to `False` when the condition for it is no longer met, which prevents unexpected behavior in subsequent iterations.
