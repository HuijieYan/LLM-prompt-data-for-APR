The buggy function contains several potential error locations:

1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` seems to be incorrectly checking if the current line is non-empty and if the current column is less than the specified column. This condition appears to be causing unexpected behavior when generating the result, especially in Case 1.
2. The logic for handling the characters '\n' and ' ' seems to be problematic and may not correctly track the current column and line.

The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of the current line and column while iterating through the prefix characters. Additionally, the handling of the conditions when encountering specific characters (' ', '\n', '\t') appears to be inconsistent.

To fix the bug, we should revise the logic for updating the `current_line` and `current_column` variables. Additionally, the condition for generating the result should be reviewed for accuracy.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n' or (char == ' ' and current_column >= column) or (char == '\t' and current_column + 4 > column):
            break
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
    return current_line, prefix[len(current_line):]
```

In this corrected version, we iterate through the prefix characters and update the `current_line` and `current_column` based on the encountered character. We also add a break condition to exit the loop when we reach the specified column or encounter a newline character. Finally, we return the `current_line` and the remaining prefix after the consumed part.
