The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column and return the consumed part and the remaining part. However, it has a bug that causes it to incorrectly handle indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The potential error in the function is with the logic for handling indentation and newline characters. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being correctly updated when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect handling of the indentation for tabulated comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly reset the `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character if there is a comment after dedent. This causes the function to incorrectly consume the prefix and return the wrong result.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling newline characters and indentation needs to be modified. Specifically, the function should reset `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character if there is a comment after dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue  # skip the rest of the loop for newline character
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset the current_line and current_column
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character if there is a comment after dedent, the corrected function should now properly handle the indentation for tabulated comments and produce the expected results.
