The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is failing because it is not handling the indentation correctly, causing the indentation of comments to be different than expected.

The potential error locations within the function could be:
1. Incorrect calculation of the current column when encountering spaces or tabs.
2. The handling of a newline character may not be correct.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the correct column and is not handling the newline character as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly calculates the indentation level and correctly handles newline characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments to the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
