The buggy code has an issue with the handling of indentation and new lines. It fails to correctly handle indentation changes, leading to improper output. The `wait_for_nl` variable is not updated correctly, causing the function to return incorrect values in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for tracking the current column and handling indentation changes. We also need to handle new lines properly to ensure that the function returns the expected output in all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char != ' ' and char != '\t' and char != '\n':
                wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values in all cases.
