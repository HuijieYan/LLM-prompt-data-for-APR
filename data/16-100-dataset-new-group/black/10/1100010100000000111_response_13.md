Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` may not be properly capturing the case where the comment should be indented the same as the next line.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the indentation of comments after a dedent. The current implementation does not correctly handle the specific case where tabulated comments are expected to maintain the same level of indentation as the next line of code.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, particularly when tabs are used in the input file.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip().endswith('\t'):
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char != '\t' and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version, we have added a condition to check if the current line ends with a tab, and if so, it appends the line to the result `lines`. Additionally, we have modified the condition for checking the indentation level to properly handle the case when the input file uses tabs.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub.
