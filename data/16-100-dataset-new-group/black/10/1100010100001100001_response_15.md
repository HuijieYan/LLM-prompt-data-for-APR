The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the logic for handling indentation and newlines. The function is failing to properly calculate and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. This is causing incorrect output in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to rethink the logic for handling indentation and newlines in the prefix. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and not char.isspace():
            wait_for_nl = False
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = False
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the specified column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.
