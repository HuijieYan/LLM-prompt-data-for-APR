The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing a failure in the test `test_comment_indentation`. The problem seems to be related to the handling of indentation spaces and tabs.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables within the function, and comparing them with the expected outputs, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters, which is leading to incorrect outputs.

One potential strategy to fix the bug is to carefully revise the logic for handling indentation, tab, and newline characters in the `for` loop in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`. Also, thorough testing with various input cases and verifying the output against expected results will be crucial.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle indentation, tab, and newline characters properly, and the test `test_comment_indentation` should pass.
