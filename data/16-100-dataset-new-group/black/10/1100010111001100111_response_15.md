The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation and newlines correctly, which is causing the failure in the `test_comment_indentation` test function.

The function should correctly consume the prefix until the specified column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining part of the prefix. However, it currently fails to handle the indentation and newlines for the comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation level when encountering tabs or spaces, leading to incorrect identification of the comment indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation levels for both spaces and tabs, as well as the newlines and comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming 4 spaces for each tab
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the updated logic, the function should now correctly handle the indentation, newlines, and comments, and pass the failing test cases. This should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub repository.
