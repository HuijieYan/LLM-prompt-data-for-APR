The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value and return the consumed prefix string along with the remaining unparsed part of the prefix. However, the function is failing to do so in some cases.

The potential error in the function is with the logic that handles the `wait_for_nl` condition when encountering newline characters. It seems that the logic for updating `wait_for_nl` and handling the `current_line` and `current_column` values is not correctly implemented for all scenarios.

In Case 1, when the input prefix is `'    # comment\n    '` and the column value is `8`, the expected output is to return `'    # comment\n'` as the partially consumed prefix, which is not happening. This indicates that the logic to handle the `wait_for_nl` condition after encountering the newline is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` condition and the management of `current_line` and `current_column` in a way that correctly partially consumes the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
