The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This is because the function incorrectly handles the indentation level of comments, leading to incorrect indentation after a dedent.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling tabulated comments and their indentation level. We also need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation level when a dedent occurs.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#') and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have added a condition to check if the current line is a comment and its indentation level should match the specified column value. Additionally, we have adjusted the logic for updating the current_column when encountering tabs, ensuring that the correct indentation is maintained.

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
