To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function so that it correctly handles the indentation for comments after a dedent. The original function seems to have issues with correctly tracking the current column and handling different types of whitespace characters.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize a `current_indent` variable to keep track of the current indentation level.
2. Modify the logic for handling space and tab characters to correctly update the `current_indent` variable.
3. When encountering a newline character, check if it's part of a comment and adjust the current line's indentation accordingly.
4. Update the `current_line` and `lines` variables based on the new logic.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_indent = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_indent < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_indent = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_indent += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_indent += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                    current_indent = column
                else:
                    current_indent = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated version should address the issue related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. It should now correctly handle various forms of indentation and spacing, ensuring that the comments are indented appropriately. This should resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
