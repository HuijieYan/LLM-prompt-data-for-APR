The bug in the given function is that it incorrectly calculates the current column when encountering spaces and tabs.

When spaces or tabs are encountered, the current column is incremented by 1 or 4, respectively. However, if a space or tab occurs at the beginning of a line, they should reset the current_column to 0.

To fix the bug, we need to reset the current_column to 0 when a space or tab is encountered at the beginning of the line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0 if char == ' ' else 0 if char == '\t' else current_column + 1 if char == ' ' else current_column + 4
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
