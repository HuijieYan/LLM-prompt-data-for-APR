The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string and return the consumed part along with the remaining part. It seems to have a bug where it incorrectly handles the indentation and new lines in the prefix string, leading to incorrect behavior when formatting comments after a dedent.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the handling of spaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the logic to determine when to wait for a newline and reset the current line and column.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. It fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments and ends up incorrectly formatting them.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly track the current indentation level, handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, and ensure that the formatting of comments is consistent. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for tracking the current column and handling the wait for a newline.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char.isspace() and not wait_for_nl:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and ensure that tabulated comments after a dedent are formatted correctly according to the expected input/output values and the issue reported on GitHub.
