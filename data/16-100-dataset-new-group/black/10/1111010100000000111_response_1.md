Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The logic for checking `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` may be causing the incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent.
2. The handling of tabs and spaces in the `elif char == ' '` and `elif char == '\t'` conditions could also be causing the issue.

Cause of the bug:
Based on the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. This suggests that the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling tabulated comments after a dedent, resulting in the incorrect behavior described in the issue.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the logic for handling tabulated comments after a dedent needs to be revised. Specifically, the function should properly handle tabulated comments and maintain the correct indentation level after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.expandtabs().lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of tabulated comments has been improved to ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs. Additionally, the condition for checking the indentation of the current line has been modified to properly handle tabulated comments.
