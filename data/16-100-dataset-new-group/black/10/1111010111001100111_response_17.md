The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior when dealing with indentation and comments. The function is not handling the indentation and comment alignment properly, which is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to fail.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the logic for tracking the current line, column, and handling indentation characters, spaces, tabs, and newlines.

The bug causes incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs. This misalignment of comments is a result of the function not properly handling the indentation and comment alignment logic.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the indentation and comment alignment, especially after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Update the column count for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The update includes handling the tab character by incrementing the column count by 4 (equivalent to the number of spaces in a tab). This fix ensures that the function correctly counts the indentation regardless of whether it is a space or a tab.

After making this correction, the function should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when using tabs.
