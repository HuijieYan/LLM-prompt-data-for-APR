Looking at the provided function and the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be related to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be incorrectly processing certain characters, leading to incorrect indentation of comments.

The potential error locations within the function could be the logic for handling tabs and spaces, as well as the condition for checking if the comment is at the expected column.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the inconsistent handling of tabs and spaces, which leads to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent. The function does not correctly determine the expected column for comments, especially when using tabs instead of spaces.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to revise the logic for handling tabs and spaces, ensuring that the function accurately calculates the expected column for comments. Additionally, the function should correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are involved.

With this in mind, here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Change tab size to 4 to match expected behavior
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the tab size is changed to 4 to match the expected behavior, and the logic for handling tabs and spaces is revised to accurately calculate the expected column for comments. This should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and ensure that the function behaves correctly for both tabs and spaces.
