        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being properly reset after encountering a newline character, causing the incorrect behavior.

### Bug fix strategy
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` after encountering a newline character, as it signals the end of a line and the start of a new one.
2. Update the logic in the loop to properly handle the indentation and newline characters.

### The corrected version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag to False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
This corrected version addresses the bug by properly resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag and updating the logic to handle indentation and newline characters.
