The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level and the presence of comments in the input text. This leads to incorrect formatting and causes the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately tracks the column and line information, especially when encountering tabs, spaces, newlines, and comments. The function should correctly consume the prefix and return the remaining text.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the indentation and comments, ensuring that the failing test `test_comment_indentation` passes successfully.
