The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior in the `test_comment_indentation` test. The failing test is due to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The error message highlights the assertion failure when comparing the expected and actual output.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when tab characters are used. This leads to incorrect indentation levels for comments in the output, which causes the failing test.

To fix this bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be updated to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when tab characters are involved.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if not wait_for_nl:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub about incorrect comment indentation after a dedent should also be resolved.
