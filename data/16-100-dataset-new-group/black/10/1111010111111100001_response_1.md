The root cause of the issue seems to be with the way that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` processes newlines and update the `lines` list. The condition `if wait_for_nl` is not reset properly once a new line is encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False  # reset wait_for_nl
                else:
                    # unexpected empty line or indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line or indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The changes are made to reset `wait_for_nl` to `False` in both the cases where the condition is currently set to `False` and code is added to update the `wait_for_nl` in the case where a newline character is encountered inside the loop.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
