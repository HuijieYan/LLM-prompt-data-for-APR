The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class. The function is designed to partially consume a prefix based on the given column position and return the consumed content along with the remaining prefix. The potential error locations within the function are in the logic for determining the indentation level and consuming the prefix accordingly.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle comment lines correctly when determining the column position, resulting in incorrect prefix consumption. This is evident from the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, which checks the indentation of comments and asserts that the contents remain unchanged after formatting.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately handle the indentation of comment lines when consuming the prefix. This can be achieved by modifying the logic for consuming the prefix based on different character types and considering the indentation level for comments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 if char == '\t' else 1
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version now consistently handles the indentation of both spaces and tabs, as well as correctly consumes the prefix based on the column position. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
