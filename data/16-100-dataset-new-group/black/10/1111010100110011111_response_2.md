The identified potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statement `if char == '\n':` and the indentation logic within that block. It seems that the function is not handling the indentation of the comment correctly after a dedent.

The cause of the bug is that when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`), it resets the current_column to 0, which is correct. But it does not handle the indentation of the comment correctly after this point.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling the indentation after encountering a newline character and ensure that the comment retains the correct indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    if current_column > 0:  # Adjust the indentation of the comment
                        lines[-1] = " " * current_column + lines[-1].lstrip()
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should handle the indentation of the comment correctly after a dedent, and it should pass the failing test case.
