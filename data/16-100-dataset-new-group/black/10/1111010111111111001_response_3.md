To fix the buggy function, we need to correct the logic for handling indentation and newlines. Based on the failing test and the provided runtime input/output values and expected input/output values, we can see that the implementation is not correctly handling the indentation and comments. The logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables needs to be fixed.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    else:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The main changes are:
1. Moved the condition for checking the indent and line completion inside the `elif` block for a newline character, to handle unexpected empty lines correctly.
2. Added an `else` block after the `if` condition to correctly append to `lines` and reset `current_line` and `current_column`.

This should fix the issue with incorrect handling of indentation and line completion. After making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
