The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is not handling the indentation and comment properly. The bug causes the test case `test_comment_indentation` to fail.

The bug is caused by the function not correctly updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags when encountering spaces, tabs, and newlines within the `prefix` string.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags are updated correctly for each character in the `prefix` string, and that the correct logic is applied for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if not wait_for_nl:  # only update column if not waiting for newline
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if not wait_for_nl:  # only update column if not waiting for newline
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, the test case `test_comment_indentation` should now pass.
