The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. This issue is related to how the function handles tab characters and newlines, resulting in incorrect indentation when using tabs. Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent with tab characters.

The main potential error locations in the function are the conditions and logic for handling tab characters, spaces, and newlines, as well as the conditions for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the indentation when encountering tab characters and newlines, leading to incorrect column counts and incorrectly formatted output.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle tab characters and newlines properly, ensuring that the indentation is maintained correctly, especially for comments that occur after a dedent.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces for each tab character
            spaces_needed = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * spaces_needed
            current_column += spaces_needed
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes a specific condition to handle tab characters, calculating the number of spaces needed to align with the next indentation level. Additionally, it ensures that the `current_column` is updated correctly based on the encountered characters, ultimately fixing the bug and maintaining correct indentation.
