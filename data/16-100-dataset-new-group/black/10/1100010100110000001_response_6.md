The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the failing test due to the unexpected behavior when encountering a comment in the input text. The function is not handling the indentation of the comment properly, resulting in incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that when the character `#` is encountered, the function assumes that the indent is finished and does not handle the comment indentation correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling comments and their indentation within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char  # Move this line inside the else block to capture all characters

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the comment indentation properly and pass the failing test.
