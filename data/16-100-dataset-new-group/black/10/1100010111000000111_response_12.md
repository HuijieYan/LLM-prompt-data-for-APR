## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # fixed condition to include the column as well
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Fixed the tab indentation to be consistent with the specified tab width of 4
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not wait_for_nl:  # check if we are not already waiting for a new line
                lines.append(current_line)  # append the current line to the lines list
                current_line = ""  # reset current_line
                current_column = 0  # reset current_column
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By addressing the conditions and indentation within the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and also resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
