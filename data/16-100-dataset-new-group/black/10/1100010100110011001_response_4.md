The issue is that the function does not handle indentation correctly and fails to correctly format the comments. The function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` to False after consuming the newline, which causes it to incorrectly handle the indentation of the comments.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly updated when encountering a newline character, and that the correct indentation is preserved when returning the formatted line.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation and formatting of the input prefix.

This should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
