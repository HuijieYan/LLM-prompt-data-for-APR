The bug is caused by the _partially_consume_prefix function incorrectly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent. The function does not properly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment line after a dedent, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _partially_consume_prefix function to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. Specifically, we need to ensure that the indentation level for comments is preserved when encountering a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        lines.append(current_line)
        current_line = ""
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

With this corrected version, the _partially_consume_prefix function should now handle the indentation for comments after a dedent correctly.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test cases for comment indentation are now passing.
