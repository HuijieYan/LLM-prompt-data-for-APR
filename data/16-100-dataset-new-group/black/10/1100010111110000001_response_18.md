The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation of the comment. It is failing to correctly calculate the indentation level when dealing with comments.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output due to incorrect handling of comment indentation.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly handle the indentation of comments by ensuring that the function accounts for this when consuming the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
