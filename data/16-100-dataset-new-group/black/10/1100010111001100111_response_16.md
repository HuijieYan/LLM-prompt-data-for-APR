The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function could be related to the incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments in the input code. The function seems to be misinterpreting the indentation level for comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect formatting.

Based on the failing test and runtime input/output variable values, it seems that the function is not properly handling the indentation and newline characters for comments within the input code.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve reviewing the logic for handling whitespace characters, specifically for tabs and spaces, and ensuring that the function accurately tracks the correct column and indentation levels for comments.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4-space tab equivalent
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function now considers newline characters separately and accurately tracks the column and indentation levels. It also correctly handles both spaces and tab characters for indentation.

This revised logic should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug by ensuring that comments are indented correctly, especially after a dedent, and maintaining consistent formatting, even in the presence of tab characters.
