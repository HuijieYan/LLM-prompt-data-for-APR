The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing an indentation issue when processing comments. It is incorrectly dedenting comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation in the output. This issue is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to report an AssertionError.

The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of the indentation and new lines in the input prefix. The function is not properly tracking the current column when encountering tabs, spaces, or new lines, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + "\n")
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, the indentation issue should be resolved, and the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should pass without reporting an AssertionError.
