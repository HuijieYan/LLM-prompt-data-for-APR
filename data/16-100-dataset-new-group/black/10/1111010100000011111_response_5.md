The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class. It takes two input parameters, `prefix` and `column`, and is intended to process the `prefix` string based on the given `column` value. The function creates a list `lines`, a string `current_line`, an integer `current_column`, and a boolean `wait_for_nl` to keep track of the processing. It loops through each character in the `prefix`, updating the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables based on the character's type.

The bug in this function is related to the incorrect handling of indentations for tabulated comments after a dedent. This causes the indentation to change incorrectly, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle tab characters when calculating the column position, causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of calculating the column position to properly handle tab characters and ensure correct indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # calculate how many spaces the tab represents
            spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces
            current_column += spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles tab characters by calculating the equivalent spaces and updating the `current_line` and `current_column` accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and correctly handle the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent for the given input scenarios.
