The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic for handling the indentation of comments. The function seems to wrongly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment after dedentation. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue where the user mentioned that the comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the indentation level when encountering comments. The logic for indenting comments after a dedent is not properly implemented, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after dedentation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation level when encountering comments after dedentation. This can be achieved by reviewing the logic for handling comments and making necessary adjustments to correctly determine the indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if (current_column + 1) % 4 == 0:
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            else:
                current_column += 4 - ((current_column + 1) % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling tabs has been adjusted to correctly determine the indentation level for comments. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
