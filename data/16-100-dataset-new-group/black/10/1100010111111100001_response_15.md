The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that when the comment is encountered, the function incorrectly checks if the current column is less than the specified column. This causes the function to return the incorrect value.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the column of the current line is less than the specified column, and if so, return the accumulated lines and the remaining prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test provided.
