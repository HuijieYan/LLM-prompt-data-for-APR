The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue in handling the indentation while consuming the prefix. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being set correctly, leading to incorrect processing of the prefix.

The function should set the `wait_for_nl` flag whenever there is a space or tab, and reset it when encountering a newline character.

The bug fix strategy for this issue is to properly set and reset the `wait_for_nl` flag based on the characters encountered in the prefix. Additionally, the `lines` list should be updated whenever a new line is encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
