The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic for handling the indentation of the input prefix. It appears that the function is not correctly identifying when the indentation ends and is not updating the current_column variable properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly handle the tab ('\t') character for updating the current_column, which leads to incorrect indentation tracking.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for handling the '\t' character to properly increment the current_column by 4. Additionally, we should reset the current_column to 0 when encountering a new line character.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Updated to properly increment by 4 for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset current_column to zero for new line character
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these updates, the function should now correctly handle indentation and return the expected result.
