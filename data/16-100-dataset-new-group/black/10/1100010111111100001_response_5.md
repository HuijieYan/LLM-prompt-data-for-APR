## The buggy function
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column. It iterates over each character in the prefix and keeps track of the current line, its indentation level, and whether it needs to wait for a newline character.

## Issues and Causes of the Bug
1. Inconsistent indentation handling: The function is not handling tab and space indentations consistently. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation levels, which can cause the function to return incorrect results.
2. Incomplete handling of indentation ranges: The function does not properly handle cases where the indentation level may exceed the specified column. This can lead to premature return of the consumed prefix.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Ensure consistent handling of tab and space indentations.
2. Properly handle cases where the indentation level exceeds the specified column.
3. Address the premature return of the consumed prefix.

## The corrected version of the function
Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            continue
        
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_column > column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line[:-1]
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected function:
- I made adjustments to the logic for handling indentation and newline characters to ensure consistent behavior.
- I added a check to handle cases where the current indentation level exceeds the specified column, allowing the function to return the consumed prefix correctly.

By applying these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
