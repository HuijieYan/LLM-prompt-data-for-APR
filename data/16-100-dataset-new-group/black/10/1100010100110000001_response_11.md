The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function seems to be related to the indentation handling. The error message is indicating a mismatch in indentation for the comment line in the contents_tab string. This suggests that the function is not correctly handling the indentation when encountering a comment.

The potential error locations within the function are the logic for handling indentation with spaces and tabs, as well as the logic for handling comments.

The cause of the bug is that when the function encounters a comment, it does not correctly handle the indentation before the comment. This results in the incorrect indentation in the output, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling comments to ensure that the correct indentation is preserved when encountering a comment.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected logic for handling comments and preserving the correct indentation, the function should now pass the failing test.
