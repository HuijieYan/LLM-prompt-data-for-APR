The buggy function seems to be a method of a class, but it is not explicitly defined as such. It is supposed to consume a prefix string and a column number, and then split the prefix string into lines based on the column number. However, there are several potential error locations within the function, such as the logic for handling different characters, updating the current_column, and waiting for a new line.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of indentation when a comment is encountered after a dedent, particularly when the input file uses tabs. This is leading to incorrect reformatting of the code by changing the indentation of the comment.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This may involve updating the logic for handling different characters, updating the current_column, and waiting for a new line.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
With the corrections made, the function should now properly handle the indentation and correctly split the prefix string into lines based on the given column number.
