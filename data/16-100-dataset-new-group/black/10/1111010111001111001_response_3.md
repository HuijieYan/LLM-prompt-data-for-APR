It seems that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not handling the input prefix properly, resulting in incorrect behavior and failing test cases. The function is intended to consume a prefix of a given string and return the consumed part along with the remaining part. However, it is not fully implementing this logic.

The potential error locations within the buggy function seem to be in the conditions for handling whitespace characters, and the logic for identifying the end of the prefix to consume.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for consuming the prefix and identifying when to stop consuming based on the given column value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ' and current_column < column:
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t' and current_column < column:
            current_column += 4
        if current_column >= column:
            break
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version makes sure to properly handle the newline character, increment the current column count, and stop consuming the prefix when the column limit is reached.

This version should properly handle the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
