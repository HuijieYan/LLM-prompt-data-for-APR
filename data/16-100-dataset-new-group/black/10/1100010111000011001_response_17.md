The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not handling the indentation correctly, resulting in incorrect `lines` and `current_line` values. To fix this, we need to modify the logic for handling whitespace characters and newline characters to correctly identify the end of the indentation. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version updates the logic for handling whitespace characters and newline characters to ensure that the `lines` and `current_line` variables are correctly updated. This should enable the function to pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output values.
