To fix the issue with the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the prefix and column input values. The current implementation has several issues with tracking line breaks, columns, and indentations.

1. The primary issue is in the case where the function is supposed to return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. The logic for handling the remaining prefix is incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

2. Additionally, the logic for tracking lines, columns, and indentations is flawed, leading to incorrect behavior when processing different types of input prefixes.

To address these issues, we need to fix the logic for tracking lines, columns, and indentations. We should also ensure that the correct prefix is returned by the function.

A corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is provided below:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            continue
        
        current_line += char
        
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    res = ''.join(lines)
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        return res, current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

In the corrected version:
- Lines are appended when a new line character is encountered. Thereby addressing the issue with tracking lines.
- The condition for returning the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix has been updated to return the remaining prefix correctly.
- The logic for tracking columns and indentation has been simplified and improved.

With these corrections, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
