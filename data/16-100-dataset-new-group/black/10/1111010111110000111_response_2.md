The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a part of the `Driver` class and is responsible for processing the indentation of code. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the indentation of comments after a dedent. The provided error message indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent" provides a detailed description of the problem and its occurrence specifically when using tabs in the input file.

The potential error location within the buggy function is when handling tabulated characters and detecting the end of indentation. It seems that the function is not appropriately handling the indentation and new line characters for tabulated code.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the tabulated characters and their impact on the indentation of comments.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle the tabulated characters and their impact on indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            continue
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if not char.isspace():
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments and pass the failing test. The issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved.
