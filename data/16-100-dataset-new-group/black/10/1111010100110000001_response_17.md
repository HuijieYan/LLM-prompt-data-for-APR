The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be failing to correctly handle the indentation level before a comment in the given test case. It seems to be dropping the indentation spaces before the comment, which causes the test to fail.

The bug in the function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of white spaces and tabs, resulting in unexpected behavior when parsing the prefix and indentation.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic of the function to properly handle white spaces, tabs, and new lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    # this is the corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_indentation = True
        indentation = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_indentation:
                if char == ' ':
                    indentation += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    indentation += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    indentation = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_indentation = False
                    current_line += char
                    current_column = indentation
            else:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_indentation = True
                    indentation = 0
                else:
                    current_line += char
                    current_column += 1
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle the indentation and comment lines, and pass the failing test.
