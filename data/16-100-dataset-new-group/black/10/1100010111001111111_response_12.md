Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue is related to the incorrect handling of the indentation level of comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments. As a result, the indentation of comments is changed incorrectly after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

The potential error location is the logic for handling the indentation level and processing of newline characters and spaces within the `prefix` string.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when encountering newline characters or spaces. This leads to incorrect handling of the indentation level and the behavior of comments when there is a dedent. As a result, the indentation of comments is changed incorrectly, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation and processing of newline characters and spaces within the `prefix` string needs to be revised. Specifically, the function should accurately track the current indentation level and handle the indentation behavior after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above correction, the function should now accurately handle the indentation level and the behavior of comments after a dedent. This should address the specific issue reported in the GitHub problem statement.
