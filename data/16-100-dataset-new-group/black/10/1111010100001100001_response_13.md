The bug in the provided function lies in the handling of the `wait_for_nl` variable. This variable is not properly reset after processing a new line, causing it to accumulate through subsequent iterations. As a result, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix and return the expected result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` variable is reset to `False` after processing a new line. This can be done by adding `wait_for_nl = False` after `current_column = 0` within the block for processing a new line.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl to False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly consume the prefix and return the expected result in all test cases.
