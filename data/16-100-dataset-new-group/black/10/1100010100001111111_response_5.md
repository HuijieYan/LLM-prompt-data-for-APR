The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of whitespace characters and the indentation level. It looks like the function is not correctly updating the `current_column` when processing whitespace characters, and it's also not handling the indentation level properly after a dedent.

The function is also not correctly identifying when to wait for a new line after an indent is finished, causing it to incorrectly handle the indentation level.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `current_column` is updated correctly when processing space and tab characters, and also correctly handle waiting for a new line after an indent is finished.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the handling of tab characters to correctly update the `current_column` based on the current indentation level. We also modified the handling of waiting for a new line after an indent is finished to ensure it works correctly.

This should address the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
