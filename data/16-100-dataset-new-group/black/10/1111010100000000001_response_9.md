The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix has a logic error in the if condition where it checks if the current_column is less than the given column. This condition is not correctly handling the cases where the current_column exceeds the given column.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the cases where the current_column exceeds the given column, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the if condition to check if the current_column is greater than or equal to the given column. Then, we can return the correct result by joining the lines and the remaining prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we modified the condition `current_column < column` to `current_column <= column` to handle the cases where the current_column is greater than or equal to the given column. This will ensure that the function returns the correct result in all cases.
