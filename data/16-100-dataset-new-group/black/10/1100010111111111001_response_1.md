The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation level when parsing the input. This leads to incorrect output for the test cases.

The root cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly sets the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a non-whitespace character, causing it to prematurely check for newlines and leading to incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling indentation levels and newlines in the input prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                current_line += char
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the function should satisfy the expected input/output values.

Do note that without having access to the entire codebase, it's important to test extensively to ensure that this change does not negatively impact other parts of the system.
