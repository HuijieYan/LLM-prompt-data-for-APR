The cause of the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being handled correctly. This flag is set to `True` when the code encounters a non-space, non-tab character, indicating that the indentation is finished and it is waiting for a new line to handle the next indentation level. However, the current implementation is not checking and updating the `wait_for_nl` flag correctly, leading to incorrect line indentations.

To fix the bug, the `wait_for_nl` flag needs to be updated correctly based on the current character being analyzed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the `wait_for_nl` flag will be updated appropriately based on the current character, ensuring correct handling of line indentations.

This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_comment_indentation` pass.
