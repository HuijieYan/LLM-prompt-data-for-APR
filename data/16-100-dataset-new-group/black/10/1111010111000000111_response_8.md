## Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is having issues with indentation handling, leading to incorrect results when reformatting code with tabs and comments.

## Error Locations
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset after encountering a new line, causing incorrect behavior.
2. The logic for handling indentation using spaces and tabs is not functioning as expected.

## Bug Cause
The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag after encountering a new line.
2. Refactor the logic for handling indentation using spaces and tabs to align with the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_indent = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_indent += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_indent += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_indent < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_indent = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version, I have removed the `wait_for_nl` flag and instead directly handled the indentation based on spaces and tabs. This should address the issues related to incorrect indentation.
