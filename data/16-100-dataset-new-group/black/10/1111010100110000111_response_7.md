## Correction
The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle the indentation properly, especially when dealing with tabs and spaces. This leads to incorrect indentation for comments after dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to handle tab and space indentation correctly. We should also consider the case when comments are involved.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    is_comment = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if is_comment:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                is_comment = False
                continue
        elif char == '#':
            is_comment = True

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 4) // 4 * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1

        if current_column <= column:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version of the function, the indentation should now be handled correctly, ensuring that comments are indented as expected. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
