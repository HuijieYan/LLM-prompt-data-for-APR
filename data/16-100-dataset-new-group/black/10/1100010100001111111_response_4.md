The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect behavior in the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is not handling the tab characters correctly, leading to incorrect indentation. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly accounting for tab characters ('\t') when calculating the current column position. This causes the function to incorrectly handle the indentation and results in the incorrect behavior described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle tab characters ('\t') and adjust the current column position accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':  
            spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # calculate the number of spaces to the next tab stop
            current_line += " " * spaces  # add spaces to the current line
            current_column += spaces  # update the current column position
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle tab characters and adjust the current column position, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
