The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function appears to be related to the logic for consuming whitespace characters and handling newlines. The function is meant to consume a portion of the input `prefix` whose total column width does not exceed a specified `column` value and return the consumed portion along with the remaining prefix. However, based on the failing test case for the `test_comment_indentation` function, it seems that the function is not handling whitespace and indentation characters correctly, leading to an incorrect output.

One potential cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` value when encountering a newline character, which may result in incorrect column tracking.

To fix the bug, the logic for consuming whitespace characters and handling column widths needs to be adjusted. Additionally, handling indentation characters (\t) and spaces properly is crucial for correct column tracking.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust column for tab
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():  # Avoid empty lines
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(res):]
                    return res, remaining_prefix
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_line.strip():  # Avoid empty lines
                res = ''.join(lines)
                remaining_prefix = prefix[len(res):]
                return res, remaining_prefix
            else:
                return '', prefix
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With the corrected function, it should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all the identified test cases.
