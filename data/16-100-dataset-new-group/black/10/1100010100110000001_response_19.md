The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling indentation correctly, resulting in the AssertionError in the failing test. The function seems to be mistakenly handling the indentation levels when encountering comments and spaces.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly adjusting the current column when encountering comments in the prefix, which leads to an incorrect comparison in the test.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling indentation, comments, and spaces within the `prefix` string. Specifically, when encountering a comment (`#`) or a space character, the function should properly handle and adjust the indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '#':
            current_column += len(prefix) - prefix.index('#')  # adjust the column based on comment position
            current_line += prefix[prefix.index('#'):]  # append the comment to the line
            break  # exit the loop since the comment marks the end of the line
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]  # return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix after consuming
```

With this correction, the function should now handle indentation, comments, and spaces correctly, passing the failing test as expected.
