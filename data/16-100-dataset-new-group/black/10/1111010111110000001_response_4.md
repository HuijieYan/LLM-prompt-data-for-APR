The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing a failing test in the `test_comment_indentation` method due to incorrect handling of indentation in the `contents_tab` string. The error message shows that the expected and actual formatted strings are not equal, specifically the part for the comment indentation.

The cause of the bug is that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the different indentation levels and the location of comments within the text. It fails to properly consume the prefix and update the current column and line.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` should correctly handle the indentation levels and comment locations to ensure that the resulting string has the correct formatting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                if current_column > column:
                    current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
                if current_column > column:
                    current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
        
        res = '\n'.join(lines) + current_line
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version ensures that the indentation is properly handled and the resulting string has the correct formatting.
