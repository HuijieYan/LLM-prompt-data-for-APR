The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has several issues:
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset when encountering a newline character, causing incorrect behavior.
2. The calculation of `current_column` is not correct for tab characters.
3. The logic for returning `res` and `prefix` is flawed, causing incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can update the function as follows:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
