The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect behavior when processing tabulated comments after a dedent. The issue is related to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments during the indentation process.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent. This causes the comments to be incorrectly indented when the input file uses tabs. The function fails to properly update the indentation level for tabulated comments, resulting in incorrect formatting.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent. This can be achieved by ensuring that the function properly tracks the current column and updates the indentation level for tabulated comments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    # this is the corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        indent = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    indent = 0  # Reset indent after newline
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                indent = 0  # Reset indent after newline
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                indent = current_column
            
            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by properly updating the indentation level for tabulated comments and ensuring that the comments are correctly aligned after a dedent.

This should resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
