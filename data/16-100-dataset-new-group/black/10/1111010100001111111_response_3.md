## The cause of the bug
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation when encountering tab characters. This leads to incorrect behavior, especially when dealing with comments and dedentation, as described in the GitHub issue. The function is not correctly maintaining the correct indentation level and is not handling tab characters properly, leading to incorrect output.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab characters and maintain the correct indentation level. We can modify the logic to properly account for tabs and adjust the indentation according to the expected behavior.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust column for tab
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line + char)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added proper handling for tab characters by adjusting the column according to the expected behavior. Additionally, we have rearranged the logic to better handle indentation levels and correctly process the input prefix.

This correction should address the issue described in the GitHub report and produce the expected output for all the provided test cases.
