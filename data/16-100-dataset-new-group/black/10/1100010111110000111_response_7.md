## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The original function does not handle the newline character correctly which leads to incorrect indentation after a newline. When encountering a newline, the function should add the current line to the list of lines and reset the current line. This way, the indentation is correctly handled after a dedent.

The corrected version of the function now correctly handles the newline character and updates the `lines` list with the current line when a newline is encountered, ensuring that the indentation is maintained properly after a dedent.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments and pass the failing test case.

Additionally, this fix addresses the reported GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent" by ensuring that the function handles tabulated comments and maintains the correct indentation.
