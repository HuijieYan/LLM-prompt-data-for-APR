The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely caused by a logic error in the condition checking for the column limit. The function does not correctly handle the case where the indentation ends before reaching the column limit.

To fix the bug, we can replace the condition that checks if the current character is a space or tab with a single condition that checks if the current column is greater than or equal to the specified column. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the indentation ends before reaching the column limit.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_column += 1 if char != '\t' else 4
            if current_column >= column:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
