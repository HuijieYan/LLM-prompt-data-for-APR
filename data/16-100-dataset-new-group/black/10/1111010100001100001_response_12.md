The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to partially consume a string `prefix` based on a given `column` value and return the consumed portion of the prefix and the remaining portion of the prefix. However, the function has some logical errors in handling the characters and updating the variables.

The function fails to correctly handle some of the cases and returns incorrect values.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to review the logic for character handling, updating the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables, and the condition for returning the consumed portion of the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # add the character
                current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the logical errors in character handling and variable updates, and ensures the correct condition for returning the consumed portion of the prefix. With this corrected version, the function should now handle the cases correctly and return the expected results.
