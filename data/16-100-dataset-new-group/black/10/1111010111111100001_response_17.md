## Potential locations of the bug:
The bug is likely to be located in the logic for tracking the columns and formatting the lines in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. 

## Explanation of the bug:
The logic for handling indentation using tabs and spaces is incorrect. When the input prefix contains a mix of tabs and spaces for indentation (e.g. "if 1:\n\tif 2:\n\t\tpass\n\t# comment\n\tpass\n"), the buggy function fails to maintain the correct column count, resulting in incorrect indentation in the output.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the correct number of spaces is added when encountering tabs or spaces.
2. Track and update the column count based on the actual indentation characters encountered.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_needed = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_needed
            current_column += spaces_needed
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
