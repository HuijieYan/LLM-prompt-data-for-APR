The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has issues with tracking the current column and handling tabulated comments. It fails to correctly identify the indentation level for comments after a dedent, which causes unexpected behavior when reformatting code with tab characters.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle tab characters when calculating the current column. As a result, it fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent, leading to the issue reported on GitHub.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to accurately track the current column and handle tab characters. Additionally, we should ensure that comments maintain the correct indentation level after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles tab characters correctly and ensures that the current column is updated accordingly. It should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and maintain the expected input/output variable values for the provided test cases.
