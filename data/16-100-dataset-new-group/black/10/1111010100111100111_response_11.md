The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. The function iterates through the characters of the prefix string and updates the current line, column, and wait_for_nl variables based on the characters encountered. The bug causes incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the buggy function is identified as the logic related to handling tabulated comments and indentation level when encountering new lines.

The cause of the bug is that the `wait_for_nl` condition is not correctly handled when encountering tabulated characters. This causes incorrect indentations for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling tabulated characters and the `wait_for_nl` condition need to be adjusted to correctly determine the indentation level for tabulated comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if char == '\n' and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by adjusting the logic for handling tabulated characters and correctly determining the indentation level for tabulated comments after a dedent. This version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
