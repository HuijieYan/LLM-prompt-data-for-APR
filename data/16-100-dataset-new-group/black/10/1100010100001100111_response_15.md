The identified issue from the GitHub thread indicates a problem with the indentation of comments after a dedent in the presence of tabs in the input file.

From the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not properly handle the indentation and wait_for_nl logic, leading to incorrect results. The function is not correctly identifying and handling the indentation levels and the presence of tabs and spaces in the prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling indentation, tabs, and spaces, as well as the wait_for_nl condition.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column//4 + 1) * 4  # calculate the actual column after tab
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:  # check if the wait_for_nl flag is set before resetting current_column
                current_column = 0
            else:  # unexpected empty line
                current_column += 1
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly handles the wait_for_nl condition, adjusts the current_column value for tabs, and handles unexpected empty lines. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
