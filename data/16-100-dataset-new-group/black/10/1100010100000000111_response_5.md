The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This is causing the incorrect reformatting of the code when using tabs in the input file.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. By properly accounting for tabulated comments, the function should be able to accurately return the intended result without causing issues with indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char in ['\n', '\t']:  # include '\t' in the condition
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Adding `char in ['\n', '\t']` condition in the `if` statement helps to properly handle both newline and tab characters, thus addressing the bug related to indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
