The root cause of the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is the incorrect handling of the current line and column count. The function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we will update the logic for handling indentation and newline characters within the for loop that iterates over the prefix string. Additionally, we will update the logic for checking the column count and appending lines accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    current_line += char
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_line += char
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the updated logic, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the indentation and newline characters, leading to the expected results for the failing test cases.
