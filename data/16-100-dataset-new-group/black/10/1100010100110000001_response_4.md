There is an issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function which is not handling the indentation properly, causing the test to fail. The function is not properly handling the indentation level of the lines.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't properly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment.
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling indentation and comments within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should handle the indentation and comments properly, and the failing test should pass.
