The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string, separating it into a leading substring that contains lines with indentation less than a specified column, and the remaining portion of the prefix string. However, the function fails to accurately determine the indentation and handle tab characters, leading to incorrect output.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. Inaccurate determination of the current column when encountering tab characters.
2. Incorrect handling of the wait_for_nl flag, leading to premature line separation.
3. Inadequate handling of empty lines and unexpected characters.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of tab characters and incorrect logic for tracking indentation levels. This bug is closely related to the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent," as it involves incorrect handling of indentation and comments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the column based on spaces and tab characters, precisely handle the wait_for_nl flag to ensure proper line separation, and appropriately handle empty lines and unexpected characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Handle tab as 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function accurately tracks the column by converting tabs to equivalent spaces, handles line separation when encountering newline characters, and properly processes non-whitespace characters. These changes address the underlying bug and align with the reported issue on GitHub.
