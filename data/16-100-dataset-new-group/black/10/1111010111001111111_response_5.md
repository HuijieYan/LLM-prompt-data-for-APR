The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. The function is not handling the indentation correctly, resulting in the incorrect formatting of comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment after a dedent. As a result, the comment is incorrectly indented.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the current indentation level and handle comments properly when encountering a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if len(current_line) < column:
                current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (column - current_column % column)
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should handle the indentation correctly and ensure that comments are formatted properly, addressing the issue posted on GitHub.
