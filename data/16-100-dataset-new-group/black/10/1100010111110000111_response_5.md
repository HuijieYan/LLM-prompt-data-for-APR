The problem with the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it is incorrectly handling the indentation when processing the input content. This leads to incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly maintaining the indentation of the comments when the input content uses tabs. This results in the incorrect reformatting of the comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation of the input content, especially when dealing with tabulated comments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # change the tab width to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # append current line to lines
            current_line = ""  # reset current line
            current_column = 0  # reset current column
            wait_for_nl = False  # reset wait_for_nl
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles the tab width by incrementing `current_column` by 4 spaces when encountering a tab character. Also, when encountering a newline character, the current line is appended to the list of lines, and appropriate reset operations are performed for the current line and column.

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the indentation properly and pass the failing test case, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
