Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the logic for handling the wait_for_nl condition. In some cases, the current_line is not being added to the lines list when it should be, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current_line is properly added to the lines list when the wait_for_nl condition is met.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the indentation and comment scenarios as described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
