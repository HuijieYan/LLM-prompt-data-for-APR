The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that the condition to check for the number of columns when encountering a newline character is misplaced, leading to incorrect handling of indentations and columns.

To fix this bug, we need to reorganize the condition to properly track and manage the number of columns when encountering different types of characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction ensures that indentation, columns, and newlines are properly handled, which will result in the function returning the expected values for the provided test cases.
