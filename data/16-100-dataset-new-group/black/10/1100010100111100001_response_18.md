Looking at the buggy function, it seems to be incorrectly handling the case when a comment is not aligned with the specified column. The function is also not correctly handling the case when the comment is at the end of the prefix.

The bug is caused by the `wait_for_nl` flag not being properly reset when encountering a newline character, which leads to incorrect handling of subsequent characters.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to properly reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline character and to correctly handle the case when the comment is not aligned with the specified column.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # checking for comment alignment
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # reset the flag
        else:
            if current_column < column:  # checking for comment alignment
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should now properly handle the cases when a comment is not aligned with the specified column and when the comment is at the end of the prefix.
