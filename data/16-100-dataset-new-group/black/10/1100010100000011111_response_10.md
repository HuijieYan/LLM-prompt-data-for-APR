The issue indicates that the indentation for comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent, specifically when the code uses tabs. The buggy function processes prefix characters and handles indentation and new lines. It seems that the issue is related to handling tab characters and indentation levels. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the indentation and tab characters, resulting in incorrect indentation for comments.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling tab characters and indentation levels. We should also ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for comments, especially after dedent. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Update the current_column based on tab position
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The key changes include:
- Removing the `wait_for_nl` condition and handling the newline character directly.
- Updating the handling of tab characters to correctly adjust the `current_column` based on the tab position.

The corrected version of the function should now handle the input prefix correctly and satisfy the expected values and types for the given test cases. It should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.
