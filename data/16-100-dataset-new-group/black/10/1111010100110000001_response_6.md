The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class has an issue with handling indentation and comments in Python code. The function is used to consume the initial indentation in a line of Python code and behaves unexpectedly when confronted with comments and indentation.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling comments when checking for indentation levels. This leads to incorrect indentation being returned and eventually causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle comments and indentation while processing the Python code. One approach to this is to separate the processing of regular lines from the processing of comment lines, as their indentation rules are different.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        in_comment = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if in_comment:
                # Ignore the rest of the characters in the comment until a newline is encountered
                if char == '\n':
                    in_comment = False
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            elif wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n' and not in_comment:
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '#':
                # Found a comment, ignore the rest of the characters until a newline is encountered
                in_comment = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I've added a check for comments and implemented separate handling for comment lines to ensure that the correct indentation is calculated. This should fix the bug and make the `_partially_consume_prefix` function work as expected.
