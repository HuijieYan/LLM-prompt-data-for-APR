## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res + current_line, prefix[len(res) + len(current_line):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjusted to provide correct indentation
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)  # Moved this line to handle the unexpected empty line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function lies in the incorrect handling of the `'\n'` character and the calculation of the next prefix. In some cases, the `prefix` string was not correctly split. Additionally, the `lines` list was not updated with the correct value when encountering a `'\n'` character.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues by adjusting the logic for handling `'\n'`, correctly updating the `lines` list, and modifying the calculation for the next prefix.

The corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values and types, and it should resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
