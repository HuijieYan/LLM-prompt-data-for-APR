def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line


```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug by correctly handling the indentation and newline characters. It modifies the conditional checks to correctly handle the current column and wait for a newline as well. This version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
