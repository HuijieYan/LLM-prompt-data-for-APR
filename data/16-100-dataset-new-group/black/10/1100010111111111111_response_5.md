The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing this issue. The function is incorrectly handling the indentation and newlines, which leads to incorrect results when processing the prefix string.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the indentation and newlines correctly when the input prefix contains mixed spaces and tabs. This leads to the incorrect calculation of the current_column and incorrect extraction of the remaining prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _partially_consume_prefix function to correctly handle the mixed spaces and tabs in the prefix input.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == "\n":
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = "".join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res) :]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue

        if char == " ":
            current_column += 1
        elif char == "\t":
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)
        elif char == "\n":
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = "".join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res) :]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char

    return "".join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles both spaces and tabs for indentation and newline characters, ensuring that the prefix is processed correctly regardless of the input format. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
