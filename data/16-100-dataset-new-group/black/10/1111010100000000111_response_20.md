## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation and new line characters in the prefix input.
- The GitHub issue indicates that the library is incorrectly changing the indentation for comments after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.

## Potential error locations:
- The logic for handling indentation and new line characters within the for loop.

## Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of tabs and spaces for indentation and new line characters within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Adjust the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle tabulated indentation and comments after a dedent.

## The corrected version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':  # Adjust the handling of tabs for indentation
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I have adjusted the handling of tabs to ensure proper indentation when processing the prefix input. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
