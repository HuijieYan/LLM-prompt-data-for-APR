## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not wait_for_nl:
                # unexpected empty line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation
The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. In the failing test, the comment indentation is getting changed after a dedent when using tabs.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditions for updating the `current_column` and handling new lines in the prefix. The updated conditions should check if `wait_for_nl` is False before updating the `current_column`. Additionally, the function should handle unexpected empty lines properly.

The corrected version of the function uses these strategies to address the buggy behavior and ensure that the comment indentation is handled correctly.

With the corrected version of the function, it should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
