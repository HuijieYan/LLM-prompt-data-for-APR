The buggy function has several issues that need to be addressed. 

First, the `wait_for_nl` variable is not being properly reset after the `if char == '\n'` condition is met. This can cause unexpected behavior in subsequent iterations. 

Second, the condition for returning the result seems to be incorrect. It should check if the `current_column` is greater than or equal to the input `column` before returning the result.

Lastly, there are inconsistencies in updating the `current_column` for different characters (spaces and tabs).

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to correctly reset the `wait_for_nl` variable, update the `current_column` consistently, and fix the condition for returning the result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
