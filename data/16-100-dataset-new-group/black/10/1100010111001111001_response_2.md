The cause of the bug is that the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not correctly handle the indentation level and waiting for new lines. This results in incorrect prefix extraction and line splitting.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic handling the indentation and waiting for new lines based on the given column value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # compare to column
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0  # reset current column after adding a line
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if current_column < column:  # compare to column
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_line = current_line[:-1]  # remove added spaces
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_column + 4 <= column:  # compare to column
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line = current_line[:-1]  # remove added tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # reset current column at new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle the indentation and waiting for new lines based on the given column value, satisfying the expected input/output values.
