To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, we need to address the incorrect handling of tab characters and their impact on the column count.

The current implementation does not correctly handle the tab character '\t' for adjusting the current column count. This causes incorrect indentation and behavior when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - current_column % 4)  # Adjust column count for tab character
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line + '\n'
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by properly adjusting the column count for the tab character '\t' using the formula `current_column + (4 - current_column % 4)`. This ensures that the column count is adjusted correctly when encountering tabs, preventing incorrect indentation behavior.

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent and resolve the indentation issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
