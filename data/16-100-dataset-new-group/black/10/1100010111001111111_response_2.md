To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to address the incorrect handling of tab characters and the indentation level when encountering comments. The bug is causing the incorrect re-indentation of comments after a dedent, as described in the GitHub issue.

The root cause of the bug is the mishandling of tab characters and incorrect tracking of the current column during the processing of the prefix string. As a result, the function fails to correctly determine the appropriate indentation level for comments after dedents.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling tab characters and correctly update the current column when encountering them. Additionally, the logic for handling comments and tracking the correct indentation level needs to be revised to ensure the expected behavior, specifically for cases involving dedents.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            current_line += char
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            if char != '\n':
                current_column += 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now correctly handle the processing of tab characters and the indentation level when encountering comments. After making these changes, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
