Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The function is not properly keeping the correct indentation level for comments, especially when using tabs.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function is updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables based on different characters in the input prefix. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to carefully review the logic for handling indentation and comments in the function. Specifically, the function should properly track the indentation level and handle comments after a dedent correctly. Additionally, it should consider the difference between space and tab characters for indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        spaces = 0  # Track spaces for indentation
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                spaces += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                spaces += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
            else:
                current_column = spaces  # Update current column based on spaces
                spaces = 0  # Reset spaces
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to properly track spaces for indentation and handle comments after a dedent, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
