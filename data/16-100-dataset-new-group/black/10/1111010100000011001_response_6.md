The buggy function contains logic to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column number. The function stores characters into `current_line` until it reaches the specified column, at which point it appends the line to the `lines` list. However, the logic is flawed and does not handle all cases correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior and incorrect return values.

The main issue is with the handling of indentation, newlines, and spaces, which leads to incorrect column counting and line accumulation. Additionally, the logic to check for an empty line is also flawed.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be rewritten to correctly handle indentation, spaces, tabs, and newlines to accurately determine the column position and accumulate the lines correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    break
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            if (current_column // 4) < (current_column + 4) // 4:
                current_line += " " * (4 - (current_column % 4))
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function now properly accumulates the lines and handles spaces, tabs, and newlines to accurately calculate the column and line position. The function should now produce the expected output for all the test cases provided.
