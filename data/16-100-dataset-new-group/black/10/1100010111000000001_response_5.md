The cause of the bug is the incorrect calculation of the current column while iterating through the prefix. This causes the function to return an incorrect result, failing the test for comment indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for calculating the current column and ensuring that the correct prefix is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 # assuming 4 spaces for each tab
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the test for comment indentation should pass as the function now correctly calculates the prefix and column for each line.
