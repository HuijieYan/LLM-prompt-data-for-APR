The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a specified column is reached. However, it has several issues, particularly with handling whitespace and newlines. The function is not correctly handling tab characters and is failing to properly track the column position.

The GitHub issue indicates that the indentation for comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs. This aligns with the behavior of `_partially_consume_prefix` failing to handle tab characters properly.

To fix the bug, the function must accurately track the column position, handle tab characters correctly, and properly identify and handle newlines. Additionally, it needs to properly handle empty lines and wait for the next line to continue consuming the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab, update as necessary
            else:
                if current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line + prefix[prefix.index(char):]
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

This corrected version of the function includes proper handling of tab characters, accurate column tracking, and correct handling of newlines and empty lines. These changes should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure the function behaves as expected.
