# The buggy function is not handling the indentation properly when waiting for a new line. It is incorrectly splitting the prefix string, which causes the failure of the test cases.

# We need to update the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a new line to correctly detect and handle the indentation levels.

# Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly handle the indentation and waiting for a new line, allowing the test cases to pass.
