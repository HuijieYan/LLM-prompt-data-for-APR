### Analysis:
The `Driver` class contains a `_partially_consume_prefix` function that is responsible for consuming a prefix while partially formatting code. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks for correct comment indentation in the code.

### Error Locations:
The potential error locations within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function are in the handling of whitespace characters (`char == ' '`, `char == '\t'`), new line characters (`char == '\n'`), and the logic to wait for a new line (`wait_for_nl`).

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, as stated in the GitHub issue. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function fails to correctly handle the indentation when consuming the prefix.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic to handle whitespace characters, new line characters, and indentation after a dedent needs to be modified. Proper tracking and handling of the current column and line indentation are essential to ensure correct comment indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    # Handle the case where the comment should maintain the same indentation as the next line
                    if not current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                # Update the indentation after a new line
                if current_line.strip() and len(lines) > 0 and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the test for comment indentation should pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
