The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to have a logic error when handling indentation and newline characters. It fails to correctly account for the expected behavior when encountering a newline character.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly sets the `wait_for_nl` flag when it encounters a non-whitespace character, resulting in the premature finalization of the indentation. This leads to incorrect splitting of the prefix into lines. Additionally, the function does not properly handle the last line, resulting in an incorrect last line being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling whitespace in the prefix and correctly separate it into lines based on the specified column. Additionally, we must ensure that the last line is properly handled and returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width of 4 spaces
                current_line += char
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
    
    lines.append(current_line)  # Handle the last line
    
    result = lines[0] if len(lines) > 0 else ''
    return result, prefix[len(result):]
```

With the corrected function, it should now correctly handle indentation, tab characters, and newlines while parsing the prefix.

By incorporating this corrected function into the codebase, the failing test should now pass satisfactorily.
