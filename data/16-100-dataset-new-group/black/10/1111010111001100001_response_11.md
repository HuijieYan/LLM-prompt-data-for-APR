The cause of the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that the logic to handle the `wait_for_nl` condition is incorrect. It is not properly checking if the current column is less than the given column value and is failing to append lines to the `lines` list when the condition is met.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle the `wait_for_nl` condition and properly update the `lines` list when appropriate.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    break
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
This corrected version should address the issue with the `wait_for_nl` condition and correctly append lines to the `lines` list based on the given column value.

By applying this change, the function should now pass the failing test and return the expected output for the given input parameters.
