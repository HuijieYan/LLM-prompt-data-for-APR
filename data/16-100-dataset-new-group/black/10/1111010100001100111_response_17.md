The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column position, taking into account spaces, tabs, and newlines to maintain proper indentation. However, it has multiple issues that cause incorrect behavior, including:

1. Incorrect detection of newline characters and column positions, leading to incorrect handling of indentation levels.
2. Inconsistent handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag, leading to unexpected behavior when encountering newlines.

Given the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent, it's clear that the function is not handling tab characters properly and is causing incorrect indentation adjustments. To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately handle tab characters in the prefix string and maintain the correct column positions.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve revising the logic for handling tab characters, updating the column position tracking, and improving the newline detection and handling.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n' or current_column >= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming a tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function accurately tracks the column position for spaces and tabs and resets the `current_line` and `current_column` when a newline is encountered or the column limit is reached. This should address the incorrect indentation behavior, especially when dealing with tab characters.
