The issue seems to be related to the indentation of comments after a dedent in a codebase that uses tabs, causing the comments to be indented incorrectly after dedent when processed by the `black` library. The bug is likely located in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, where the indentation logic is handled.

Upon analyzing the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the `wait_for_nl` condition is causing the issue. When the function encounters a newline character and is waiting for a newline, it incorrectly resets the current column and creates empty lines. This leads to incorrect handling of the indentation of comments after dedent.

To fix this bug, the `wait_for_nl` condition needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the indentations of comments after dedent. The logic for tracking the current column and lines should be modified to accurately represent the intended behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the `wait_for_nl` flag has been removed, and the logic for handling the current column and lines has been simplified to accurately track the indentation. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
