The issue is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, specifically when using tabs in the input file. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely causing the incorrect behavior.

The function is designed to consume a prefix string while keeping track of the column and line information based on spaces, tabs, and newline characters. It appears that the implementation is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs. This is causing the comments to be incorrectly indented after dedenting.

The critical point of error seems to be in the condition where it checks for characters '\t' and '\n', as well as the logic for handling the 'wait_for_nl' flag.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking tabs and newlines should be revised to ensure proper handling of indentation, especially when using tabs. Additionally, the logic for handling the 'wait_for_nl' flag should be adjusted to correctly identify and handle the end of an indentation block.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_column += 1  # Adjust for other characters
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The key changes in the corrected version include properly handling tab characters to adjust the column, and adjusting the logic for tracking the end of an indentation block when encountering a newline character. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
