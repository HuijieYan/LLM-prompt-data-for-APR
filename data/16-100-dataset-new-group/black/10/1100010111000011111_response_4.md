## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#') and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of the indentation level for comments. In the provided test case, comments are not being handled correctly after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison condition to check if the current line is a comment and if the column is less than the expected column. If it is, we return the result. Otherwise, we continue processing the lines.

The corrected version of the function checks if the current line starts with a comment and if the current column is less than the expected column. If both conditions are met, it returns the result. Otherwise, it continues processing the lines.

This corrected version should now handle the indentation for comments correctly after a dedent, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
