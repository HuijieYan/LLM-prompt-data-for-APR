The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` can be identified in the logic for handling the indentation of comments. It fails to correctly manage the indentation of comments when there is a mix of tabs and spaces.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle tab characters correctly when calculating the current column. This results in incorrect indentation when there is a mix of tabs and spaces in the input prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling tab characters and ensure that the current column is calculated accurately, taking into account both spaces and tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_space = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += tab_space
            current_line += ' ' * tab_space
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function handles tab characters correctly and accurately calculates the current column, taking into consideration both spaces and tabs. This fix addresses the issue with incorrect indentation of comments when there is a mix of tabs and spaces in the input.
