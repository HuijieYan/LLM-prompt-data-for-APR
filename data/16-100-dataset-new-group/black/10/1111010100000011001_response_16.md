The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix is designed to process a given prefix string and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix based on the input column. However, there are several potential error locations within the function, such as incorrectly updating the current line, column, and flag variables, as well as not handling certain cases properly.

One of the main bugs in the function is the incorrect logic for updating the current_line and current_column variables. Additionally, the handling of tabs and newline characters seems to have some issues.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly update the variables based on the input prefix and column. It should also handle space, tab, and newline characters appropriately to determine the consumed and remaining prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # adjust the number of spaces for the tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function handles the character processing, updates the variables correctly, and returns the expected consumed and remaining prefix based on the input column.
