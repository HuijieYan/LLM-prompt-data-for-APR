## The buggy function analysis
The buggy function is called `_partially_consume_prefix` and is part of the `Driver` class. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix of characters and return the remaining unparsed prefix.

The function takes two parameters: `prefix` (a string) and `column` (an integer). It initializes variables `lines` (a list), `current_line` (a string), `current_column` (an integer), and `wait_for_nl` (a boolean) to track the parsing progress.

The function iterates through each character in the `prefix` string and updates the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` based on the encountered character.

The cause of the bug seems to be handling the line break and indentation. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation level for the comment.

The error message from the failing test indicates a formatting mismatch in handling comments, which implies the incorrect handling of line breaks and indentation.

## Bug Fixes Strategy
To fix the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`, I would suggest the following steps:
1. Identify and correct the logic responsible for tracking the line break and indentation of the prefix string.
2. Ensure that the indentation level is properly accounted for when processing the prefix string.
3. Update the conditional logic to handle the wait for newline and indentation.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Check for improper indentation and handle it properly
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
