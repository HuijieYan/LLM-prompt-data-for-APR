To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comments are correctly indented based on the column parameter provided. The current implementation does not handle indentation for comments after a dedent correctly, which results in incorrect output.

The issue on GitHub provides a good description of the problem, and it's clear that the bug is related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when using tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the _partially_consume_prefix function to correctly handle the indentation of comments. We should also consider the use of tabs and ensure that the comments are properly aligned based on the given column parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Adjust as per tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have modified the handling of '\t' to adjust the current_column by 8, assuming the tab width is 8 spaces. This ensures that the indentation is calculated correctly for tabs. We also adjusted the logic to handle the indentation of comments correctly.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function produces the expected output for the given test cases.
