The issue in the buggy function lies in the logic for adjusting the indentation level. When there is a tab character, the current_column is being incremented by 4, which may lead to incorrect column calculations.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the current_column accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust the current_column for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above changes, the function should correctly handle tab characters and adjust the current_column accordingly.

After making these changes, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
