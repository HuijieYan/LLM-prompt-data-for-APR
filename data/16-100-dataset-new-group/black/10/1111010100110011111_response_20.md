## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line = char + prefix[prefix.index(char) + 1:]
                return ''.join(lines), current_line
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function fixes the issue by properly handling the cases of spaces, tabs, new lines, and other characters. It ensures that the indentation is correctly maintained, especially for tabulated comments after a dedent.

By walking through the input string character by character, the function correctly builds the lines and updates the current column and other variables as needed. It also correctly identifies and handles the cases of spaces, tabs, and new lines.

This corrected version should resolve the reported issue on GitHub and pass the failing test.
