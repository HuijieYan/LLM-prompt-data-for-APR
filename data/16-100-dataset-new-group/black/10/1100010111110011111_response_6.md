## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # changed to add 4 to current_column
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function causes incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The issue arises due to the incorrect handling of tab characters ('\t') in the input prefix.

To fix this bug, we have modified the line `current_column += 4` under the condition `elif char == '\t'` to add 4 to the current_column instead of just 1. This change ensures that the indentation is correctly handled for tab characters, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
