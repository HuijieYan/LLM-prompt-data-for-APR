The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces when processing the input prefix. This leads to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

- In Case 1, the function failed to correctly identify the current column when processing a prefix that includes a comment with mixed tabs and spaces.
- In Case 2, the function did not handle an empty prefix gracefully, as it did not reset the current column and other related variables.
- In Case 3, the function incorrectly identified the current column due to the presence of a tab in the prefix.
- In Case 5, the function also failed to handle the mixed tabs and spaces in the input prefix, resulting in incorrect indentation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tabs and spaces in the input prefix, and correctly calculate the current column based on the actual indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # adjust column for tab
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function properly handles both spaces and tabs to calculate the current column. It also resets the current column and line when encountering a newline character, and adjusts the column for tabs. This revised approach should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
