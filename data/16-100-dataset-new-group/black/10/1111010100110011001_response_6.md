The bug seems to be in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` of the Driver class. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the indentation changes and the wait for the newline character. This may be causing the incorrect output in the failing test.

The function is expected to partially consume a given prefix string up until a specified column value, and then return the consumed part and the remaining part. It is doing so by iterating through the characters in the prefix, updating the current line and column values, and waiting for a newline character to signify the end of indentation.

Based on the failing test, it seems that the function is not properly handling the indentation changes and the wait for the newline character, resulting in the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the indentation changes and newline characters, track the consumed part correctly, and ensure that the function properly returns the consumed part and the remaining part.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the indentation changes and wait for the newline character, ensuring that it returns the correct consumed part and the remaining part.
