## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the condition to check if the current line is less than the specified column is incorrect. The code is checking if the current line is empty or if the current column is less than the specified column. This is leading to incorrect behavior when trying to consume the prefix.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to properly check if the current column is less than the specified column.

## The corrected function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Updated condition to check the current column
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
