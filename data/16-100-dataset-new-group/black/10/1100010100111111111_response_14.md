To fix the bug in the given function, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the indentation level of comments after a dedent. The current implementation is not properly handling the indentation when a comment is encountered after a dedent.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level when encountering a comment after a dedent. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, leading to failing tests and the reported issue on GitHub.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling comments and indentation. Specifically, we need to ensure that when a comment is encountered after a dedent, its indentation level is preserved and matched with the next line of code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):  # Check if the line is a comment
                if current_column > column:  # Adjust the indentation level if it's a comment after a dedent
                    current_column = column
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles the indentation level for comments after a dedent by adjusting the column value when encountering a comment. With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, passing the failing tests and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
