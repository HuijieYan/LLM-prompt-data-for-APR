## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The variable `lines` is not being updated correctly when processing a new line with a tab or space.
2. The condition for appending `current_line` to `lines` is incorrect, leading to incorrect indentation of the comment.

## Cause of the bug
The buggy function fails to handle tabulated comments after a dedent correctly, leading to incorrect indentation. This causes the failing test and the GitHub issue reported.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tabulated comments after a dedent. This involves updating the `lines` list correctly and adjusting the logic for appending `current_line` to `lines` to ensure the comment indentation is preserved.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
The corrected function includes an additional `elif` block for handling the newline character correctly and updates the logic for appending `current_line` to `lines` to preserve the comment indentation.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
