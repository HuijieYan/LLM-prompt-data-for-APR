The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of the _partially_consume_prefix function in the blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py file does not handle the indentation correctly for comments after a dedent. It incorrectly adjusts the indentation for comments, leading to the failing test case test_comment_indentation in the tests/test_black.py file.

The expected behavior is that the comments should maintain the same level of indentation as the following line after a dedent, whether the code uses tabs or spaces for indentation.

To fix this issue, the function needs to accurately track the level of indentation and handle comments correctly after a dedent. The logic for handling indentation and comments needs to be revised to align with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent and brings the behavior in line with the expected output.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs.
