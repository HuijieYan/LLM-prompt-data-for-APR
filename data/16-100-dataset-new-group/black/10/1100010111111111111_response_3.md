The issue appears to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs in the input file. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` also indicates the incorrect handling of indentation for comments.

The bug seems to be located in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically in the logic for handling indentation and waiting for new lines.

The cause of the bug is as follows:
- The function does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs in the input file.
- The logic for handling indentation and waiting for new lines is not appropriately implemented, leading to incorrect behavior while processing the prefix input.

To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should be modified to properly handle the indentation and waiting for new lines, especially when dealing with tab characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # adjust column for tab
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line += char
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    lines.append(current_line)  # handle the case when the loop ends without encountering a newline
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the incorrect handling of indentation and waiting for new lines, especially when tab characters are involved.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, and the expected input/output values should be satisfied. This correction will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
