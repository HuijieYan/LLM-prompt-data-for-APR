                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0

```

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The issue seems to be related to the handling of newlines and columns increment, causing incorrect processing of the input prefix string.
2. We need to ensure that the `current_column` and `lines` are updated correctly and the correct prefix is returned.
3. We should also handle the case when the entire prefix is consumed and return the modified lines and prefix.
