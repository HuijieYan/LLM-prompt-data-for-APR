The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, where the logic for handling indentation and comments is incorrect, causing issues with the formatting of the code. The failing test for comment indentation indicates that the comment is being incorrectly reformatted after a dedent.

The cause of the bug is in the logic for handling indentation and comments. The function does not correctly handle the indentation level when encountering comments, leading to incorrect formatting.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation and comments needs to be revised. The function should correctly track the current column and handle the wait for new lines in a way that preserves the original code's indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # non-space character encountered, check and handle comments
                if current_column < column:
                    # add the current line to the result
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the indentation and comments correctly, allowing the tests to pass and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
