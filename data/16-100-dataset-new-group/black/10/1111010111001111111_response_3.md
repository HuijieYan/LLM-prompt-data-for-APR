            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8  # Fix the tab width to be 8
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:

``` 

### Explanation
The issue is related to the incorrect handling of tab characters, which results in the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent. The original function uses a hard-coded value of `4` for tabs, which does not align with the standard tab width of `8`. This causes the incorrect indentation of comments.

To fix this issue, the corrected function updates the tab width to `8` when encountering a tab character. This aligns the behavior with the standard tab width and ensures that comments are correctly indented after a dedent.

By making this change, the corrected function addresses the underlying cause of the bug and ensures that comments are properly indented when using tabs, as described in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub by correctly handling tab characters.

This should fix the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when using tabs, as reported in the GitHub issue.
