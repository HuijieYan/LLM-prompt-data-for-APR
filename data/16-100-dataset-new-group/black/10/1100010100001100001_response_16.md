The issue with the function is that it doesn't handle cases where the prefix is consumed and the column is not reached. This causes incorrect results in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where the prefix is consumed but the column is not reached. In this case, we should return the remaining prefix and an empty string for the consumed part.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function handles the case where the prefix is consumed but the column is not reached, ensuring correct results in all scenarios.
