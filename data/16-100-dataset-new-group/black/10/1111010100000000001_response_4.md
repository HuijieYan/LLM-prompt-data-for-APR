The buggy function "_partially_consume_prefix" is attempting to partially consume a prefix string up to a specified column. It iterates through the characters in the prefix string and updates the current line and column count accordingly.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The logic for updating the current column count and waiting for a new line character.
2. The handling of different types of whitespace characters.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle indentation and unexpected empty lines. This may result in incorrect consumption of the prefix string and an inaccurate return value.

To fix the bug, the buggy function should implement a more robust logic for handling different types of whitespace characters and tracking the current column count accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function now correctly handles different whitespace characters and tracks the current column count accurately. It also properly handles unexpected empty lines.
