The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. This is causing the failing test test_comment_indentation to produce an incorrect error message due to indentation differences in the returned prefix.

The cause of the bug is due to the function incorrectly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent. The wait_for_nl flag is not being set correctly when encountering a newline character in the prefix, leading to incorrect handling of the indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the wait_for_nl flag is set correctly when encountering a newline character, and also adjust the indentation handling accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the _partially_consume_prefix function should handle the indentation for comments after a dedent correctly, resolving the issue and allowing the failing test to pass.
