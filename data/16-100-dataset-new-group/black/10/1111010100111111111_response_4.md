To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle the indentation and comments. The issue seems to be related to the handling of whitespace, tabs, and newlines.

From analyzing the runtime values, types of variables, and expected values, it is clear that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and comments, especially when the input contains a mixture of tabs and spaces.

To resolve this issue, we can refactor the logic of the _partially_consume_prefix function to properly handle the indentation and comments, considering both spaces and tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab, can be modified based on the specific requirement
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version takes into account both spaces and tabs for indentation, handles comments properly, and correctly identifies the end of lines.

This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case. Additionally, it addresses the problem highlighted in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
