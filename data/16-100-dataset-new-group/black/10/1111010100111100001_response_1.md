Based on the provided information, the potential error in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in the logic used to handle the indentation levels and line breaks. The issue seems to be causing incorrect handling of indentation, leading to the behavior that's indicated by the failing test.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly tracking the column-level indentation when consuming the prefix. It fails to adjust the current_column properly, and as a result, the line-break handling and indentation level detection is flawed, ultimately leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we can amend the logic for tracking the current_column and handling the wait_for_nl flag. Specifically, we should include the necessary adjustments for indents and line breaks. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, adjustments have been incorporated to ensure that the column tracking and line-break handling are done correctly. This should address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
