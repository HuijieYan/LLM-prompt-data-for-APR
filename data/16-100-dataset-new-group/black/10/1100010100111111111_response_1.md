The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters when determining the current column. When a tab character is encountered, the current_column is incremented by 4, which is the incorrect behavior. This results in incorrect indentation when processing prefix content.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling tab characters in the _partially_consume_prefix function. Instead of simply incrementing the current_column by 4 when a tab is encountered, we need to calculate the correct indentation based on the current column position and adjust it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now properly handle the indentation of tab characters and return the expected output for the failing tests.

This fix addresses the reported GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent" by ensuring that the indentation for tab characters is handled correctly in the _partially_consume_prefix function. This should resolve the problem of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
