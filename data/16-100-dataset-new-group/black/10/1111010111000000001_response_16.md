The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to format Python code by adjusting the indentation level in line with the given `column`. The bug in this function causes an error in the `test_comment_indentation` test leads to test failure.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. In the portion of code that handles waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl` logic).
2. Incorrect indentation column tracking.

The cause of the bug in the function is that it does not correctly handle indentation when a comment is added after a block that requires reformatting with different levels of indentation. The test fails because the function does not handle cases where a comment is added at the end of a block and needs to ensure the proper indentation is maintained.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to revise the logic for handling indentation and new lines, ensuring that it correctly tracks the indentation level and adapts to comments and new lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        is_comment = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip():
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    is_comment = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line += ' ' * (column - current_column)
                current_column = column
                wait_for_nl = True
            elif char == '#' and (not lines or lines[-1].strip() or is_comment):
                is_comment = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding a condition to handle comments and adjusting indentation with spaces on new lines, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
