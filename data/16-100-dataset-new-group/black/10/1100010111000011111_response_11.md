The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and indentation. The function is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column position, but it is not handling tabs correctly. This is causing incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling tab characters when calculating the current column position. This leads to incorrect indentation behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately calculate the current column position when encountering tab characters. This can be achieved by properly incrementing the current column with the appropriate number of spaces for each tab character.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle tab characters properly and produce the expected output, thus resolving the issue reported on GitHub. The corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
