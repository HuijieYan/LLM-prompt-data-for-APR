The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and counting the indentation levels correctly. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix of a string based on a specified column value.

Based on the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function is not correctly handling the tab characters and the indentation level, leading to incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly account for the indentation level when encountering tabs and is not properly handling the wait_for_nl condition.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic of the function to properly handle tab characters and calculate the correct indentation level. Additionally, the wait_for_nl condition needs to be handled correctly to identify when to wait for a new line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and partially consume the prefix based on the specified column value. This updated function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
