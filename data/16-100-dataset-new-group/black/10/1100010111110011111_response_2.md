To fix the bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file. It appears that the issue is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent in the input file that uses tabs.

Looking at the failing test and the expected values, it seems that the function is not properly handling the indentation and wait_for_nl conditions. This could be the cause of the incorrect output and the failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic for handling indentation and newline characters in the function, making sure that the comments are properly indented based on the input file's structure.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This updated function should address the issue described in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.

By carefully revising the logic for handling indentation and newline characters, the function should now correctly handle comments after a dedent in the input file that uses tabs. This should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported in GitHub.
