The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to process and partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. The function is used to consume whitespace characters and identify the beginning of a new line based on the indentation level specified by the column.

The potential error location in the function is within the logic that handles the indentation level, specifically in the nested `if` statements and the conditions for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the indentation level and the beginning of a new line correctly, leading to incorrect processing and consumption of the prefix string.

To fix the bug, I suggest updating the logic for handling indentation and the beginning of a new line by accurately tracking the current column and waiting for the next line when the expected column is reached.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the processing and consumption of the prefix string based on the specified column.

After applying the fix, the function should be retested with the failing test to ensure that it now passes.
