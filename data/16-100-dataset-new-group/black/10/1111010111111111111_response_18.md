To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to address the incorrect handling of tab indentation for comments after a dedent. The bug is causing the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` to produce unexpected output due to incorrect handling of indentation for comments.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect calculation of indentation and handling of comments in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset after processing a new line, leading to incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab indentation and comments after a dedent. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset appropriately and that the indentation level is correctly calculated.

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Update this to correctly handle tab indentation
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset the current_column when encountering a new line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the wait_for_nl flag
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected logic, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle tab indentation and comments after a dedent correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test case.
