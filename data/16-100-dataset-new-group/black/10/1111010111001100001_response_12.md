The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments in the prefix input. This causes the function to return an incorrect result, leading to failing tests.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly handle the indentation of the comments in the prefix and ensure that the function returns the expected result for the given input.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Updated this block to increment current_column by 4 instead of 1
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Updated this block to reset current_column to 0
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments in the prefix and return the expected result.
