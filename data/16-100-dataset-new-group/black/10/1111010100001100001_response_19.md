The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` inside the `Driver` class. This function is supposed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. The function initializes some variables and then iterates through the characters of the prefix string, updating the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables based on the character being processed.

The bug seems to be occurring when the function identifies a newline character. In some cases, the logic involving `wait_for_nl` and newline characters is causing issues, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the condition to check for the end of the indent (i.e., `wait_for_nl`) should be re-evaluated to correctly handle leading whitespace, tabs, and newline characters. Additionally, handling of whitespace characters and tabs should be adjusted to properly update the `current_column` value.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                break
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            if current_column + spaces <= column:
                current_line += ' ' * spaces
                current_column += spaces
            else:
                break
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                break
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to handling whitespace and newline characters, as well as updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables based on the specified column value.
