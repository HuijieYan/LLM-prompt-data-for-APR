The buggy function has logical errors in the conditions and operations within the for loop. The function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column number and return the consumed part and the remaining part. 

The issue in the current implementation can be identified from the provided runtime test cases. Below is the analysis for each case:

### Case 1:
The input prefix is `'    # comment\n    '`, and the column is `8`. The output should be `'# comment\n    '`. However, the buggy function returns an incorrect result. The variables `current_line` and `wait_for_nl` are not handled appropriately. 

### Case 2:
The input prefix is an empty string, and the column is `4`. The expected output should be an empty string. The buggy function does not return the correct result as it doesn't handle the empty string case properly.

### Case 3:
The input prefix is `'\t# comment\n\t'`, and the column is `2`. The expected output should be `'# comment\n\t'`. However, the buggy function produces an incorrect result, failing to track the consumed string and remaining string properly.

### Case 4:
The input prefix is an empty string, and the column is `1`. The expected output should be an empty string. The buggy function does not handle the empty string case properly.

### Case 5:
The input prefix is `'\t\t# comment\n\t'`, and the column is `2`. The expected output should be `'# comment\n\t'`. The buggy function fails to handle the tab characters correctly.

### Case 6:
The input prefix is `'        # comment\n    '`, and the column is `8`. The expected output should be `'# comment\n    '`. The buggy function does not process the consumed part and remaining part correctly.

From the analysis of the runtime values, it is evident that the buggy function doesn't handle different scenarios, including empty string input, correct consumption of prefix based on the column, and handling of whitespace characters.

To fix the bug, the function logic needs to be redesigned to handle each scenario effectively and accurately return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0

    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

The updated function revises the logic to more accurately track the consumed and remaining parts of the prefix string based on the given column number. It effectively handles different scenarios and resolves the logical errors present in the original function.
