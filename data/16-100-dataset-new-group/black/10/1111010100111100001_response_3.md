One potential cause of the bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that the `wait_for_nl` flag does not get reset properly. This can lead to a situation where the prefix consuming loop stops prematurely when encountering a newline character, causing lines to be incorrectly appended.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that `wait_for_nl` is properly reset when a newline is encountered, and also modify the logic for appending lines to ensure that it captures the correct prefix.

Below is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag when encountering a newline
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # Set the flag when encountering non-space/tab characters
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version accounts for properly resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering newline characters and adjusts the logic for appending lines to ensure the correct prefix is captured. This should fix the bug and make the function work as intended.
