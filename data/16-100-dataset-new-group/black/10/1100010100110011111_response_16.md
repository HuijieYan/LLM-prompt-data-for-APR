## Correction Strategy
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. While analyzing the failing test and the expected input/output values, it is clear that the current implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the indentation and line breaks. To fix the bug, the logic for tracking the current line and column should be adjusted to properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent.

To correct this bug, we need to make sure that the function correctly handles the indentation and line breaks, ensuring that the output preserves the correct indentation for comments after a dedent.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function adjusts the logic to properly handle the tracking of current line, column, and line breaks. It should now correctly handle the indentation and line breaks, ensuring that the output preserves the correct indentation for comments after a dedent.
