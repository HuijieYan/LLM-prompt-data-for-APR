The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to the handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent. This causes the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` to produce an incorrect result. The expected input and output values for the failing test are also provided.

The potential error locations in the buggy function could be the logic for handling indentation and new line characters.

The cause of the bug can be explained by the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handling the indentation for comments. This results in the failing test case producing the error message and incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we can revise the logic for handling indentation and new line characters in the function to ensure that comments are correctly indented based on the input.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By fixing the handling of indentation and new line characters in the function, the corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test case. This will also satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
