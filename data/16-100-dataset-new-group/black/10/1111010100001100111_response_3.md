The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a given prefix and consume part of it based on the specified column value. It aims to return the consumed part of the prefix and the remaining part.

There are several potential error locations within the buggy function, particularly in the logic for handling tabs and spaces, as well as the handling of newlines.

The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, particularly with tabulated comments. This is reflected in the runtime input/output variable values, as well as in the GitHub issue where the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling tabs, spaces, and newlines in such a way that it correctly consumes the prefix based on the specified column value, without altering the indentation of comments.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            for _ in range(spaces_to_add):
                current_line += ' '
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we handle tab characters by converting them into the equivalent number of spaces based on the current column value. We also properly handle newlines and adjust the current line and column values accordingly. This should resolve the issue with incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.
