### Fixing the Bug

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation for comments with tabs. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` and the corresponding error message indicate that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments when the input file uses tabs.

The GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent" further explains the problem, validating that Black reformats the indentation of comments incorrectly when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments with tabs.

### The Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            while current_column % 8 != 0:  # Assuming tab width of 8
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test should now pass without any errors.
