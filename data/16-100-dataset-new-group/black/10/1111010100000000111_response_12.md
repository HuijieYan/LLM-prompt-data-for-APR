The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to process a prefix string character by character and keep track of the current line, column, and indentation level. The function is intended to split the prefix into lines based on a specified column.

The potential error locations within the function could be in the logic for tracking the current line, column, and indentation level, as well as in the conditions for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines.

The cause of the bug, as reported in the GitHub issue, is that the function incorrectly changes the indentation for comments after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comments. This may involve updating the conditions and logic for tracking indentation levels and handling tabulated comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # consider tab width
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                # if a newline is encountered, reset wait_for_nl flag
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished if not a space or tab
               wait_for_nl = True
    
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes a modification in the logic for handling tabs by considering the tab width as 4 spaces. This should resolve the reported issue related to incorrect changes in the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
