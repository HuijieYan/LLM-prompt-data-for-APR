The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not handle the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent. This causes the incorrect formatting of comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column//4 + 1) * 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation of comments correctly and pass the failing test.
