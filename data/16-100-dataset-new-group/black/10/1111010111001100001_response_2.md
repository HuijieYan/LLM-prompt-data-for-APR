The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical issue where it is incorrectly handling the indentation level for the given prefix and the column value. This is evident from the failing test `test_comment_indentation` for cases 1, 3, and 6, where the return values do not match the expected output.

The strategy to fix this bug is to properly track the indentation level and check whether the column value is reached. The function should handle different characters appropriately (spaces, tabs, newlines) and update the current line and column based on these characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    skip = False
    for char in prefix:
        if skip:
            skip = False
            continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            current_column = next_tab_stop
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

        if current_column >= column and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            skip = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the indentation-related issues and accurately handle the given prefix and column value, passing the failing test.
