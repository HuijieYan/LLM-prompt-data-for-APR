### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for part of the problem that causes incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. The issue in GitHub also confirms that the problem arises when the input file uses tabs.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The handling of indentation with tabs.
2. The logic for waiting for a new line to handle comments.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the mishandling of tabulated indentation and the logic for waiting for a new line to handle comments. When the input file uses tabs, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation and subsequently misplaces the comments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to address the mishandling of tabulated indentation and the logic for waiting for a new line. Specifically, the function needs to correctly handle tabs and adjust the logic for waiting for a new line to ensure that comments are handled appropriately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':  # adjust for tabulated indentation
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':  # adjust for tabulated indentation
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""  # reset current_line for correct handling of comments
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the mishandling of tabulated indentation and corrects the logic for waiting for a new line. With these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and comments, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
