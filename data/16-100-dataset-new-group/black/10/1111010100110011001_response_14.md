## The buggy function and bug's potential locations
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a given prefix string until a certain column within that prefix is reached. It then returns the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix.

A potential location for the bug is within the condition `if wait_for_nl`. If this condition is not triggered appropriately, it may cause incorrect consumption of the prefix string and lead to the returned values not satisfying the expected output.

## Cause of the bug using the failing test, the corresponding error message, the expected input/output variable values
The failing test indicates that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not return the expected output. This suggests that the function is not handling the prefix string correctly or not reaching the expected condition to trigger the correct behavior.

The failing condition in the failing test:

```python
contents_tab = "if 1:\n\tif 2:\n\t\tpass\n\t# comment\n\tpass\n"
contents_spc = "if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n    # comment\n    pass\n"
self.assertFormatEqual(fs(contents_tab), contents_spc)
```

As per the failing condition, the `contents_tab` should be formatted to match the `contents_spc`. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely being used to format the string, and it fails to return the expected result.

The expected output variables include `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`, `char`, and `res`. However, based on the failing test, these variables do not hold the expected values.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`, the conditions for consuming the prefix string need to be reviewed and corrected. The logic within the loop needs to be adjusted to correctly handle characters within the prefix and trigger the expected behavior based on the specified column.

Additionally, the handling of newline characters, spaces, and tabs should be carefully considered to ensure that the prefix string is consumed accurately.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
This corrected version addresses potential issues in the original function by adjusting the condition handling, including the consumption of characters and the correct assignment of `wait_for_nl`.

The corrected version is designed to support the expected input and output variable values and should satisfy the failing test.
