The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a prefix string based on a given column number. However, it fails when it encounters comments and indents in the failing test `test_comment_indentation`. The function fails to correctly consume the prefix and return the remaining prefix, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle comments, indentations, and newline characters. Specifically, it needs to handle the case where a comment is encountered within the prefix and ensure that the correct prefix is returned after consumption.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    ignore_multiple_spaces = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if ignore_multiple_spaces:
                continue
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            ignore_multiple_spaces = False
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished or comment
            if current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            ignore_multiple_spaces = True
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        
        if current_column <= column:
            lines.append(current_line)
        else:
            ignore_multiple_spaces = True
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these updates, the corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
