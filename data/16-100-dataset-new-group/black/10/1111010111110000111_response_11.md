The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing the incorrect indentation issue. The function is responsible for consuming characters from a prefix until a certain column is reached, preserving the consumed characters and the remainder. The issue seems to be related to the handling of tab characters within the prefix.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates the problem by comparing the expected output with the actual output. The test fails with an assertion error, indicating that the actual output does not match the expected output.

The error message specifically shows the difference in indentation for the comment after the `pass` statement. It indicates that the comment is not correctly aligned compared to the expected output.

The corresponding GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent" provides additional context about the bug. It describes the specific scenario where the incorrect indentation occurs and mentions that it only happens when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, focusing on the handling of tab characters and indentation. The strategy for fixing the bug should involve carefully parsing the prefix while considering the different types of whitespace characters and their impact on the indentation of comments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
                # Check if there is an unexpected indentation
                if char not in [' ', '\t']:
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version addresses the indentation issue by properly handling tab characters and addressing unexpected indentation. After implementing this correction, the `test_comment_indentation` should pass successfully, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
