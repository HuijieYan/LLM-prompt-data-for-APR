## Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a part of the `Driver` class. It takes two input parameters: `prefix` of type `str` and `column` of type `int`. The purpose of this function is to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column number. The function loops through each character in the prefix string and tracks the number of spaces, tabs, and new lines to determine where to partially consume the prefix.

The function seems to have several potential error locations, including the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and new lines, the condition for determining when to wait for a new line, and the incorrect handling of column number relative to indentation.

## Identified Bug Cause
Based on the failing test and the runtime values, it seems that the function is incorrectly consuming the prefix string, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output. In particular, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation levels of comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect output.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function's logic for handling spaces, tabs, and new lines needs to be revised to accurately track the indentation and consume the prefix string accordingly. Additionally, the condition for waiting for a new line and the handling of column numbers need to be adjusted to ensure the correct consumption of the prefix.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column + 1 < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of spaces, tabs, and new lines has been adjusted to accurately track the indentation levels. Additionally, the condition for waiting for a new line and the comparison between the current column and the specified column have been modified to ensure correct prefix consumption.
