To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the indentation and consumption of prefix lines. Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the calculation of `current_column`. It appears that the function does not correctly handle the indentation level when encountering comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to carefully track the current indentation level (`current_column`) and handle the indentation of comments based on this level. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix lines while maintaining the correct indentation for comments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # ignore empty lines
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the indentation of comments correctly, consuming the prefix lines while maintaining the expected indentation level. This fix should address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
