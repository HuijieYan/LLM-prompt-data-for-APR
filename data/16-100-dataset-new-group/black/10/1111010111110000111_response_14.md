The cause of the bug is that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not handle the indentation of comments after a dedent properly, which leads to incorrect reformatting of the code when using tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces to add based on the current column
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the handling of the tab character ('\t'), the function will now properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent in the presence of tabs, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

With this correction, the failing test for comment indentation should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
