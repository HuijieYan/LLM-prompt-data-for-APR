## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the current implementation, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation when encountering comments after a dedent. To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic for handling the newline character and managing the indentation level. After the dedent and encountering a newline character, the current line should be added to the list of lines, and the current column should be reset to 0.

Once these modifications are applied, the function should be able to correctly handle the indentation and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
