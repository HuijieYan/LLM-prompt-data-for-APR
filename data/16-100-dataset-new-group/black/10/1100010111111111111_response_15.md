The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation and tab characters in the input prefix. This function is used to consume a prefix of a string up to a certain column. The bug causes incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. From the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the error message shows that the comment indentation is being incorrectly changed.

The bug appears to be in the logic that handles indentation, tab characters, and newlines. The function fails to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the column count accordingly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should be revised to properly handle tab characters and adjust the column count. Additionally, the logic for handling newlines and wait_for_nl flag should be reviewed and corrected. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should now pass, and the `assertFormatEqual` calls should not raise any assertion errors.

The updated function should now handle tab characters and indentation correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent.
