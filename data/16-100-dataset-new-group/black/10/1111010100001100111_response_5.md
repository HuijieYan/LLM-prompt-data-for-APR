The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle the partial consumption of a prefix by considering indentation levels and line breaks. However, it fails to properly handle the cases where the input prefix contains tab characters. This is causing incorrect behavior and indentation changes as reported in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the handling of tabs and the calculation of the current indentation level.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle tab characters when calculating the current column for indentation. This leads to incorrect behavior when dealing with tabs, resulting in indentation changes as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, you can modify the function to properly handle tab characters when calculating the current column for indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 8) // 8 * 8  # Adjust for tab character
            current_line += ' ' * (current_column - len(current_line))  # Update current line with spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, when a tab character is encountered, the current column is adjusted to account for the tab character, and the current line is updated with spaces to reflect the correct indentation level. This modification ensures that tab characters are handled properly, addressing the indentation issue reported in the GitHub bug.
