The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be designed to process the prefix string and consume the characters up to a certain column number. However, there are a few potential error locations within the function:

1. The check for `current_column < column` seems to be incorrect, as it should be checking for the length of the processed line so far, not the current column count.

2. The logic for handling tabs (`\t`) and spaces (`' '`) may be incorrect, as it is not properly updating the `current_column` count.

3. The handling of newlines (`\n`) and the unexpected empty line condition may also be problematic.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that it does not accurately track the position of the current line being processed and does not correctly handle the consumption of characters up to the specified column.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for tracking the current column count, handle tabs and spaces properly, and correctly check for the consumption of characters up to the specified column.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                remaining_prefix = prefix[len(res):]
                return res, remaining_prefix

    return prefix, ""
```

In this corrected version, we properly update the `current_line` and `current_column` based on the characters encountered. We also correctly check for consuming characters up to the specified column and return the remaining prefix.
