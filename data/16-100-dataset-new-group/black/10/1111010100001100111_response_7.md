The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior in handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. The function is not correctly tracking the column position when encountering tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect handling of the indentation level.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect tracking of the `current_column` variable when encountering tabs and spaces. The function is not correctly accounting for the column position when tabs are encountered, leading to incorrect behavior when determining the expected indentation level of the comments.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to accurately track the column position when encountering tabs and spaces. Additionally, it should properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_line = current_line.lstrip()
                if current_line and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += ' '
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
                current_line += '\t'
            else:
                if not wait_for_nl:
                    # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
            if not wait_for_nl:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1

        return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly handles the column position when encountering tabs and spaces, and it correctly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, and the function should now behave as expected.
