The bug in the provided function is that the initial value of `current_line` is not added to the `lines` list.

Here is a strategy for fixing the bug:
- Check if `current_line` is not empty and `current_column` is less than `column`. If so, add `current_line` to `lines` and return the joined `lines` and the remaining `prefix`.
- Also, add the `current_line` to `lines` if `wait_for_nl` is True.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
