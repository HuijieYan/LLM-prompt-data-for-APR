One potential cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation levels and waiting for a new line before considering a line as completely consumed. This is evident in the failing test, as it fails to correctly handle the input prefix and column values, leading to incorrect outputs. 

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the function accurately tracks the indentation levels and waits for a new line before considering a line as consumed. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                # reset the column count after consuming a new line
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
            # reset the column count when a new line is encountered
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that it properly handles the indentation levels and waits for a new line before considering a line as consumed. It resets the column count after consuming a new line and when a new line is encountered, thereby satisfying the expected input/output values.
