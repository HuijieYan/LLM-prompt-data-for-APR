The bug exists in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where it's not properly handling the indentation and newline characters, resulting in incorrect indentation in the output. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly counting the number of spaces or tabs to determine the indentation level.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the cases when encountering whitespace and newline characters by updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_column += 1
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should handle the indentation properly and pass the failing tests provided.
