## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)  # Append the current line when encountering a new line
                current_line = ""  # Reset the current line
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The buggy function contains a logic error where it fails to append the current line when encountering a new line character ('\n'). This results in the last line not being included in the 'lines' list.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to append the current line to the 'lines' list when encountering a new line character ('\n') and then reset the current line to an empty string. This will ensure that all lines are captured correctly.

In the corrected version, I have added the lines to append the current line and reset it when encountering a new line character.

This should fix the bug and ensure that all lines are captured and processed correctly.
