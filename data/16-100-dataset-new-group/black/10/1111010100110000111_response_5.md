## Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` might not be properly handling the indentation check.

Cause of the bug:
The current implementation of `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not properly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation modification.

Strategy to fix the bug:
- Update the logic to properly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Adjust the indentation for comments
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
