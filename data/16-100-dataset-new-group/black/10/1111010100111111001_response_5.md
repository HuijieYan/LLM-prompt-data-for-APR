The cause of the bug is that the current implementation does not properly handle the indentation counts when encountering tabs or spaces. As a result, the function is not able to accurately consume the prefix and determine the number of spaces at the specified column.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the implementation to correctly handle indentation counts for spaces and tabs. We should also ensure that the logic for updating the `lines` list and `current_line` string is accurate.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = [""]
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append("")
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if current_column >= column:
            break
    return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[len(''.join(lines)) + len(current_line):]
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by properly handling spaces and tabs for the indentation counts, along with correctly updating the `lines` list and `current_line` string.

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test cases provided.
