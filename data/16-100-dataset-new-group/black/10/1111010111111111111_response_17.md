The issue with the buggy function lies in the logic for handling the indentation level and waiting for a new line. It seems that the logic for tracking the indentation level is not correctly handling tab characters, and it is not properly maintaining the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the indentation level and properly waits for a new line after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_indent = 0
    expected_indent = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_indent < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_indent = 0
                expected_indent = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_indent += 1
            expected_indent += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_indent = (current_indent // 4 + 1) * 4
            expected_indent += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_indent = 0
            expected_indent = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_indent < expected_indent:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and also pass the failing test cases. The function now properly handles tab characters and correctly waits for a new line after a dedent.
