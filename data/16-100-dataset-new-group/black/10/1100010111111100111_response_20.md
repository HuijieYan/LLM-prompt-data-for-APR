The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly consuming prefix characters that include comments and tabs. This leads to incorrect indentation when the input file uses tabs. The function fails to handle the indentation of comments properly, resulting in the wrong output.

The buggy function fails to correctly handle the indentation, especially when it encounters a comment and spaces or tabs between the code and the comment. It fails to accurately calculate the column position and identify when the comment indentation should end.

The main cause of the bug is the incorrect tracking of the column position and the handling of tab and space characters while processing the prefix. This causes the incorrect removal of prefix characters and the subsequent incorrect indentation of comments when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to reimplement the logic for handling tab and space characters while processing the prefix and accurately calculate the column position. Additionally, we need to ensure that the comment indentation is handled correctly based on the column position.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_column < column:
                num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_line += ' ' * num_spaces
                current_column += num_spaces
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected implementation, the function should now handle the indentation and processing of prefix characters correctly, ensuring that comments are indented as expected based on the column position. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
