The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is failing to handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is not correctly updating the `current_column` value to track the correct indentation level when encountering tabs or new lines. This results in the incorrect indentation of comments when there is a dedent in the input.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation and update the `current_column` value as it processes the input prefix.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            
            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function properly updates the `current_column` value when encountering tabs and newline characters. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure proper handling of indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
