The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be in the logic that handles indentation in the prefix. It appears that the function is not correctly identifying when to stop reading characters for the current line and append it to `lines`.

The function appears to be incorrectly updating the `current_column` when encountering a newline, and the logic for handling `\t` and `' '` characters might also be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is updated correctly, and that the logic for recognizing when to append the current line to `lines` is correct.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = [""]
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == " ":
            current_column += 1
        elif char == "\t":
            current_column += 4
        elif char == "\n":
            lines.append("")
            current_column = 0
        else:
            lines[-1] += char
            if current_column >= column and not char.isspace():
                break
    return "\n".join(lines), prefix[len("".join(lines)):]
```

This corrected version should address the logic issues in the original function and pass the failing tests.
