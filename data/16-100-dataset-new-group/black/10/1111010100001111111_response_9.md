Based on the runtime values and expected values, it seems that the issue is related to how the function handles indentation with spaces and tabs. The function should correctly handle the indentation and properly consume the prefix based on the given column.

One potential error location is in the conditions for handling spaces and tabs, and the logic surrounding the `wait_for_nl` flag.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly consuming the prefix based on the column and handling indentation with spaces and tabs. This results in incorrect output where the comments are not properly aligned after dedent.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately track the column position and handle both spaces and tabs consistently when consuming the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                continue
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle both spaces and tabs, and correctly consume the prefix based on the given column.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
