## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # modified condition to include column value
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # changed from 4 to 8 to match tab size
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The issue with the original implementation is that the handling of tab characters (\t) and the indentation calculation is incorrect. By modifying the conditions and the calculation of the tab size, the corrected version of the function should now be able to handle the indentation of comments correctly, especially when tabs are used.

By making these changes, the function should now align with the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
