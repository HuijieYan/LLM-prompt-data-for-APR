The bug appears to be related to the indentations and handling of tab characters. Based on the failing test and the error message, the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle tab characters correctly, which results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

The function is designed to process a prefix string and consume characters until a certain column is reached. It keeps track of the current line, column, and whether it is waiting for a new line. However, it does not handle tab characters properly, which leads to incorrect indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the function to properly handle tab characters and maintain correct indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    # Corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                # Calculate the number of spaces to reach the next tab stop
                spaces_to_tab = 8 - (current_column % 8)
                current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_tab
                current_column += spaces_to_tab
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]

                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    # unexpected empty line
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should now handle tab characters correctly and maintain proper indentation according to the expected input/output values and the failing test case. This should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
