The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical error in handling the input prefix and the column value. The function fails to correctly parse the prefix and adjust the column value when encountering indentation in the prefix string.

The function is intended to consume a part of the input prefix string and return the consumed part as well as the remaining part of the prefix. However, the current implementation does not handle indentation and line breaks correctly.

The main issue is that the function does not update the `current_column` when encountering tab characters or spaces in the prefix. Additionally, it fails to update the `current_line` and `lines` correctly when a newline character is encountered.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly update the `current_column` when encountering spaces or tabs and correctly handle the `current_line` and `lines` when a newline character is encountered.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version should correctly handle indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters, and thus pass the failing test.
