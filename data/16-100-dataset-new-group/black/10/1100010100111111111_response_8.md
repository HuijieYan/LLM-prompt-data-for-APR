To fix the bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation and comments. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem with the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. We can see that the bug is causing the comments to be incorrectly reindented after a dedent.

Looking at the failing tests and the expected values, we can identify that the issue lies within the logic for handling whitespace, tabs, and newlines. The current implementation is not accurately tracking the column position and incorrectly handling the comments.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for tracking the column position and handling the indentation of comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust the column based on the current position
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the logic for handling tabs to correctly adjust the column position based on the current position. This will ensure that the comments are correctly reindented after a dedent when using tabs.

With this fix, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the indentation and comments correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing tests.
