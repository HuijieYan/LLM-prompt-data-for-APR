To fix the given buggy function, we need to update the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` method to correctly handle the indentation of lines. The issue is that the function is not properly tracking the column positions of characters, leading to incorrect indentation in the output. As a result, the failing test `test_comment_indentation` is not passing.

The buggy function is failing to handle the indentation of comment lines correctly. It should consume the prefix input and return the consumed lines as well as the remaining input. The incorrect indentation is likely caused by the way the current line and current column are being updated within the function.

Based on the provided test function and error message, we can observe the failing results that indicate incorrect indentation in the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately track the indentations in the prefix and handle the column position updates for the characters. We can use the `current_column` variable to track the relative indentations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                # Reset current column for a new line
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line.strip())
                    current_line = ""
                current_column = 0  # Reset current column after consuming the line
        return '\n'.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function reads each character of the prefix, updates the current line content, and checks for newline, space, and tab characters. Additionally, it now maintains the correct `current_column` value throughout the function to ensure proper indentation tracking.

After making these changes, the function should be able to handle the indentation of comment lines correctly and pass the failing test.
