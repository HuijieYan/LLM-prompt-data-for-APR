The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has several issues that need to be resolved. The main problem is that the function does not correctly handle the column parameter, and the logic for waiting for a new line is flawed.

Here's a logic for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize the `lines` list to store the lines consumed from the prefix.
2. Initialize `current_line` to store the characters of the current line being processed.
3. Initialize `current_column` to track the current column.
4. Set `wait_for_nl` to False to start.
5. Iterate through each character in the prefix and update `current_line` and `current_column` accordingly.
6. Handle space, tab, and newline characters based on the column and update the relevant variables.
7. When the current column surpasses the given column, return the consumed lines and the remaining prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n' and current_column >= column:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the prefix string and column parameter. It correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column and returns the consumed lines along with the remaining prefix.
