## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Bug analysis, location, cause, and strategy for fixing
The bug in the original code causes the function to incorrectly handle indentation, resulting in incorrect prefix consumption. The issue is caused by the incorrect logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the management of `wait_for_nl` flag. This leads to incorrect indentation tracking and line processing.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines should be restructured, and the `wait_for_nl` flag should be managed properly. The corrected version of the function includes these changes, ensuring that the function correctly consumes the prefix based on the given column and indentation.
