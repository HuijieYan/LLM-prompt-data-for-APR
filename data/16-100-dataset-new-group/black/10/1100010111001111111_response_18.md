The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and the calculation of the current column. The function is not correctly preserving the indentation level for comments.

The bug appears to occur when the function encounters a comment that is at a deeper level of indentation than the code above it. The function fails to accurately preserve the indentation level of the comment.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters and correctly calculate the current column when encountering different types of characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issue by correctly handling the indentation levels and preserving the original formatting, as described in the GitHub issue.
