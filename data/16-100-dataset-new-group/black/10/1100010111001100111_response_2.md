The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation of comments correctly when there are tabs in the input. It fails to preserve the original indentation of the comments. This is evident from the failing test `test_comment_indentation` in the file `tests/test_black.py`. The function is supposed to partially consume the prefix and return the consumed part and the remaining part, but it is not doing so correctly for inputs with tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the indentation with tabs correctly, causing it to incorrectly consume the prefix and return incorrect results, leading to a failure in preserving the original indentation of the comments.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation with tabs and ensure that the comments are preserved as per the input.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
        elif char == '\n':
            if '\t' in current_line:  # Check for tab indentation
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())  # Count spaces for indentation
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check to handle tab indentation and correctly count the indentation spaces, ensuring that the original indentation is preserved, especially for comments.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the comments' indentation is correctly preserved even when the input file uses tabs.
