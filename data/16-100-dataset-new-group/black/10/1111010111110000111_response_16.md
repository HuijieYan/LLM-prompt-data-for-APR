The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. The issue appears to be related to the incorrect handling of tab characters and indentation.

The potential error locations within the function include:
1. Improper handling of tab characters and their corresponding indentation levels.
2. Incorrect logic for tracking the current column while parsing the input prefix.

The cause of the bug is evident from the failing test `test_comment_indentation`. The error message indicates a specific assertion failure, showing that the expected output does not match the actual output after running the function. This is consistent with the GitHub issue where a specific example is provided to showcase the incorrect behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to carefully review and update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab characters, indentation levels, and the positioning of comments in the input prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Update the indentation level for tab character
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)  # Append the line to lines and reset current_line and current_column
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # No need to set wait_for_nl if char is neither ' ' nor '\t'
                pass

            current_line += char  # Move this line to the end to avoid storing characters before processing

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected logic, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent for both tab-separated and space-separated input.
