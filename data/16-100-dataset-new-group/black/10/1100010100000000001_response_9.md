The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix based on the column number provided. It initializes variables such as 'lines', 'current_line', 'current_column', and 'wait_for_nl' to track the state of the iteration through the prefix string.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditions and logic within the for loop that iterates through the prefix string, as well as the return statement at the end of the function.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that it did not correctly handle cases where the current column exceeds the specified column number, and it did not handle cases where the prefix ends without reaching the specified column number.

To fix the bug, a strategy to correct the function would be to properly handle cases where the current column exceeds the specified column number and where the prefix ends without reaching the specified column number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    return ''.join(lines), current_line
            else:
                continue
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += ' ' * (4 - (current_column % 4))  # consider tab size
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                return ''.join(lines), current_line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I have added proper logic to handle cases where the current column exceeds the specified column number, and modified the conditions and return statements to ensure the function correctly handles all edge cases.
