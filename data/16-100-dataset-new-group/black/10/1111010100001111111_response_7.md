The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. This is causing incorrect indentation when reformatting the code using tabs.

The buggy function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters, leading to incorrect behavior when processing prefix text.

The buggy function incorrectly handles whitespace characters and newlines, leading to incorrect indentation levels. The cause of the bug is the mishandling of tab characters and incorrect tracking of the current column.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the current column based on whitespace characters and properly handle newlines and tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        
        if current_line:
            lines.append(current_line)
        
        res = ''.join(lines)
        if len(res) <= column:
            return res, ""
        else:
            return res[:column], prefix[len(res):]
```
In this corrected version, the function properly handles whitespace characters and newline characters, accurately tracking the current column and maintaining the correct indentation level.
