In the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, the issue seems to be with the handling of lines and current_line. It looks like the logic to handle whitespace and newlines is causing the problem. The function's purpose is to consume a prefix string up to a specific column and return the consumed part and the remaining part.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of whitespace and newlines. This causes incorrect results when the function is used to consume the prefix string based on the given column.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix string up to the given column while handling whitespace and newlines properly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle whitespace and newlines properly, consuming the prefix string up to the specified column. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
