The bug in the function _partially_consume_prefix() is causing incorrect behavior in the test_comment_indentation() test function. When the input file uses tabs, the indentation for comments is changed incorrectly after a dedent.

The potential error location in the _partially_consume_prefix() function is likely in the logic related to handling tab characters and calculating the current column.

The bug is caused by the function incorrectly handling the tab characters in the input prefix, leading to incorrect calculation of the current column and incorrect handling of the wait_for_nl flag. This results in incorrect output for the indentation of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling tab characters and calculating the current column to ensure that the behavior of the function is consistent regardless of whether the input file uses tabs or spaces for indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix() function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            to_next_tabstop = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * to_next_tabstop
            current_column += to_next_tabstop
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the handling of tab characters and the calculation of the current column, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the input file's indentation style.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the test_comment_indentation() test function passes as expected.
