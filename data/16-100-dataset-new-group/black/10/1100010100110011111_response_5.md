## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    if prefix[len(res):].startswith('\n'):
                        return res + '\n', prefix[len(res)+1:]
                    else:
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                if prefix[len(res):].startswith('\n'):
                    return res + '\n', prefix[len(res)+1:]
                else:
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
1. The buggy function didn't handle the indentation correctly for comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect output.
2. I added an additional check to see if the remaining prefix after consuming the indent ends with a newline character. If so, the correct output is returned with the newline character included. Otherwise, the output is returned without the newline character.
3. The bug was caused by the function not properly handling the case where the remaining prefix after consuming the indent ends with a newline character. This led to incorrect output in the test case.
4. By adding a conditional check to handle the newline character at the end of the remaining prefix, we can ensure that the correct output is returned based on the input.
5. The corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation correctly for comments after a dedent and produce the expected output.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test case and produce the expected output.
