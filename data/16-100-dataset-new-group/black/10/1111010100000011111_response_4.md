To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces during the indentation process.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the column count accordingly. We also need to ensure that comments are properly indented based on the column value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column + 4) // 4 * 4  # Adjust column for tab
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line += char
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # Adjust column for newline
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This version of the function includes modifications to correctly handle tabs and spaces during indentation. It adjusts the column count when encountering tabs and indents comments based on the column value.

This should fix the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
