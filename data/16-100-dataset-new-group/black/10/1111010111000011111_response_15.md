The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing the incorrect behavior identified in the GitHub issue. The function is supposed to handle the indentation of comments, but it fails to correctly handle the indentation level after a dedent, especially when using tabs. This leads to incorrect formatting of the code.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the logic that determines the indentation level and handles the wait_for_nl condition.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation level after a dedent. When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function fails to adjust the comment indentation based on the actual indentation level of the code. This leads to incorrect formatting of the code, as observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly track the indentation level and adjust the comment indentation accordingly. Additionally, the logic for wait_for_nl condition should be revised to handle the behavior after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the current_column calculation for tabs has been adjusted to correctly handle the indentation level. Additionally, the condition for handling the wait_for_nl has been updated to correctly reset the indentation after a new line character.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
