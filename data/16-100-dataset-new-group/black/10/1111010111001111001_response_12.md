The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, where the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines within the prefix is incorrect. The expected behavior of the function is to partially consume the prefix based on the specified column, but it fails to do so in some cases.

One potential cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of indentation and the newline character within the prefix. As a result, the function does not correctly identify the indentation level and consumes the prefix incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly identify the indentation level and handle the newline character.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by correctly identifying the indentation level and handling the newline character within the prefix.

With this corrected version, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
