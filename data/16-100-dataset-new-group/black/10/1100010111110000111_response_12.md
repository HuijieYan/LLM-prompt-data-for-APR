The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect reformatting of the code when tabs are used in the input file.

The potential error location within the buggy function could be the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the logic for handling indentation with spaces and tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the scenario where a comment is at the same indentation level as the next line of code after a dedent. This leads to incorrect reformatting of the code.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling indentation and comments. Specifically, we need to ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the code at the same level of indentation after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    comment_indent = -1
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                comment_indent = -1
        else:
            if comment_indent == -1 and char in [' ', '\t']:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                comment_indent = current_column
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, and the failing test should pass. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
