The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to handle the indentation properly. This causes the output to be incorrect when comparing contents_tab and contents_spc in the failing test.

The bug occurs at the `wait_for_nl` condition, which is not being reset properly. This means that if the function encounters a newline character, it doesn't properly reset the `wait_for_nl` flag.

To fix the bug, we need to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to False when encountering a newline character so that the function can correctly analyze the indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag here
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag here as well
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the correction, the function should pass the failing test.
