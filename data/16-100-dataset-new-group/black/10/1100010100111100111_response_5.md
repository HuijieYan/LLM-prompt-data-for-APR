The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior when indenting comments in Python code with tabs. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case where there is a comment after a dedent. This can be seen from the failing test, where the comment is not correctly aligned with the following line after indentation.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the case where a comment follows a dedent, ensuring that the comment is properly aligned with the following code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 8) // 8 * 8  # align to next tab stop
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, the issue reported in the GitHub bug should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test. This fix ensures that comments are properly aligned with the following code after a dedent, regardless of whether tabs or spaces are used for indentation.
