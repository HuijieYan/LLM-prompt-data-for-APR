The bug in the function lies in how the `wait_for_nl` flag is being handled. When `wait_for_nl` is True, the function incorrectly identifies an empty line when it encounters a newline character and resets the `current_column` to 0, which is causing incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks for an empty line and reset the `current_column` only when `wait_for_nl` is True and the current line is non-empty. Additionally, we need to reset the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character regardless of the state of `wait_for_nl`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and current_line.strip():
            if char == '\n':
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now behave as expected and satisfy all the provided test cases.
