The cause of the bug is that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the indentations and comments in the input code. This results in incorrect handling of comments after a dedent, leading to improper indentation in the output.

The function fails to properly handle the scenarios where comments are located after an indentation change. This causes the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly track the indentation level and handle comments after indentation changes, ensuring that the output maintains the correct indentation for comments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:  # Check for comment indentation
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:  # Check for comment indentation
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles comment indentation after dedents, ensuring that the output maintains the correct formatting.

These changes should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test cases.
