The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior in the formatting of tabulated comments after a dedent. The function incorrectly handles the indentation of comments and does not produce the expected output. This behavior is reported in the GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent".

Upon analyzing the function and the failing test, it is apparent that the issue arises from the mishandling of indentation levels, especially with tab characters. The function does not correctly track and adjust the indentation level when encountering comments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately calculate and maintain the proper indentation level as it processes each character of the input prefix. This includes correctly identifying spaces, tabs, and new lines, and adjusting the indentation level accordingly.

The corrected version of the function would be:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab, as per Python convention
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now accurately handle the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent and produce the expected output, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
