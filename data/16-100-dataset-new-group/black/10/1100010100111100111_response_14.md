The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. This can be observed from the failing test, which shows that the comment indentation is being changed incorrectly. The bug likely occurs due to the function not correctly identifying when a comment is being dedented and failing to adjust the indentation accordingly.

The function tracks the current line, column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line character. It then iterates through each character in the prefix, incrementing the current column based on spaces and tabs, handling newlines, and waiting for a new line character when the indent is finished. However, there is a logic error in the function that causes it to fail to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately detect when a comment is being dedented and adjust the indentation accordingly. The logic for handling the indentation of comments after a dedent needs to be modified to ensure that the correct level of indentation is maintained.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"): 
                # adjust the comment indentation based on the current column
                current_line = " " * current_column + current_line.lstrip()
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function now checks if the current line is a comment after encountering a newline character. If it is a comment, it adjusts the comment's indentation based on the current column value to ensure that the correct level of indentation is maintained.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent and pass the failing test. This addresses the reported issue on the GitHub repository related to incorrect comment indentation when using tabs.
