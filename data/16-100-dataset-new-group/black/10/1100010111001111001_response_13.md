The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix up to a specified column. It does this by iterating through the characters of the prefix and splitting it into lines based on indentation.

Upon analyzing the function and its relationship with the failing test, it appears that the function incorrectly handles indentations and new lines when consuming the prefix.

The `wait_for_nl` variable appears to be used to check if the function should wait for a new line character before considering the current line finished. However, this logic seems to be flawed as it does not account for the indentation level and new lines correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately track the current column while consuming the prefix and correctly handle the indentations and new lines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = [""]
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append("")
            continue
        lines[-1] += char
        if current_column >= column:
            break
    return '\n'.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

This corrected version of the function accurately tracks the current column and properly handles the indentation and new lines. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
