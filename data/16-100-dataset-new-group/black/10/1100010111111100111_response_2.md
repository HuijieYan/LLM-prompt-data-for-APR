The issue with the current code is that it incorrectly handles the indentation for comments after a dedent. It fails to correctly adjust the indentation level for comments in the code.

The potential error location is within the logic for handling the indentation of comments. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` should correctly adjust the indentation for comments based on the existing code indentation level.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. This causes the incorrect indentation of comments in the output, leading to failing tests and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be revised to properly handle the indentation for comments. It should take into account the existing code's indentation level and adjust the comment indentation accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""  # reset current_line for new line
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == '#':
                current_column += 1  # adjust the indentation level for comments
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, the indentation level for comments is properly adjusted based on the existing code's indentation level.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test `test_comment_indentation` passes successfully, addressing the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
