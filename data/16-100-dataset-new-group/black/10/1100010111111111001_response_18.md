The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` causes it to incorrectly handle indentation levels when consuming a prefix string. This leads to failing the test `test_comment_indentation` with the error message showing a mismatch in the indentation of a comment line.

The issue is that the function does not handle whitespace characters properly. In particular, when encountering a newline character, the function should reset the `current_column` to 0. Additionally, it should handle the case where the prefix ends before consuming a full line.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the indentation levels and correctly consume the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char

        if current_line and current_column >= column:
            return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version accounts for the indentation and correctly handles consuming the prefix string. It should now pass the failing test and produce the expected input/output values.
