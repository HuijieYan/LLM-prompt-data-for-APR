The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix and return the partially consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. It checks for newline characters and updates the state of `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` accordingly.

After analyzing the provided failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, it seems that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation for comments within the `if` blocks.

The error occurs due to the incorrect handling of whitespace characters and newline characters. The function does not correctly update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when encountering different types of whitespace, resulting in an incorrect response.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately track the column and handle different types of whitespace characters including tabs and spaces.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        elif char != '#':  # ignore rest of the line (comments)
            break
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version accurately updates the `current_column` for both spaces and tabs, handles newline characters correctly, and ignores the rest of the line when encountering a comment symbol '#'.

By using this corrected version, the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` should pass as the function now correctly handles the indentation of comments within `if` blocks.
