The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column position. However, the function fails in cases where the prefix contains tab characters and newlines, resulting in incorrect behavior.

The bug appears to be in the logic for handling tab characters and newlines. When a tab character is encountered, the `current_column` is increased by 4, but this may not correspond to the expected behavior for all cases. Additionally, the logic for handling newlines and empty lines seems to be incorrect.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for handling tab characters and newlines, ensuring that the `current_column` is updated correctly. It may also be necessary to adjust the conditional logic for `wait_for_nl` and check when a new line is needed to be appended to `lines`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # Check if current line needs to be included
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic for tab characters and newlines, we can ensure that the function now correctly handles these cases and provides the expected output.
