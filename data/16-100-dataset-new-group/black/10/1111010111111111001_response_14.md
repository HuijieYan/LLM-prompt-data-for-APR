The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to not pass. The issue arises from the incorrect handling of indentation in the function.

The function incorrectly handles the indentation of comments and fails to maintain the original indentation as expected by the failing test. This leads to the assertion error when comparing the formatted output with the expected value.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the indentation of comments and maintain the original formatting while consuming the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate the number of spaces needed to align with the next tab stop
            current_line += " " * num_spaces
            current_column += num_spaces
        else:
            break  # Exit the loop when encountering non-indentation characters
    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass, and the function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
