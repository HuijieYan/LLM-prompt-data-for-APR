The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` causes incorrect behavior with tabulated comments after a dedent. This is in line with the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The bug occurs when the function encounters a tab character '\t' in the input prefix. Instead of correctly calculating the indent level, the function increments the current_column by 4, leading to incorrect indentation handling.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the behavior of the function when it encounters a tab character '\t'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces required to reach the next tab stop
            spaces_to_tab_stop = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_tab_stop
            current_column += spaces_to_tab_stop
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle the tab character '\t' to calculate the correct indent level. This ensures that tabulated comments after a dedent are handled correctly, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
