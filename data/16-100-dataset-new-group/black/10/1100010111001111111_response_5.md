## Correction

After analyzing the bug and test cases, it appears that the issue stems from the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not handling the tab characters correctly. When encountering tabs, the function does not correctly update the `current_column` value.

To fix this issue, the function needs to correctly handle the tab characters and update the `current_column` value accordingly. We can modify the function to properly track the column positions by considering the tab character as equivalent to four spaces.


## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
                    
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the tab characters correctly, updating the `current_column` value as needed. This should resolve the indentation issue with tabulated comments after a dedent.
