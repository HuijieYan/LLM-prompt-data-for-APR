The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not properly handling the indentation levels in the input prefix, resulting in incorrect output. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is designed to check the indentation of comments in a specific format and is failing due to the incorrect behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

The potential errors in the function can be attributed to the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the tracking of the current indentation level.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to correctly identify and handle the indentation levels in the input prefix string by accounting for spaces, tabs, and newlines. It should accurately determine the current column and lines based on the indentation rules. A possible strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review and update the logic for handling indentation and newlines, ensuring that the function processes the input prefix correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the input prefix string correctly, enabling it to pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
