The buggy function is intended to partially consume characters from a string based on a given prefix until a specific column is reached. The function has a bug where it does not properly handle the indentation of comments in the prefix, leading to incorrect output and an assertion error in the test case.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the indentation of comments within the prefix string. When a comment is encountered, the function fails to properly track the column and does not remove the comment from the prefix before returning it.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a comment is encountered, its indentation is properly handled and removed from the prefix before it being returned.

Below is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':  # Handle indentation of comments
            while current_column < column and char != '\n':
                current_line += char
                char = next(prefix)
                if char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            prefix = char + prefix  # Add the remaining characters back to the prefix
            continue
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the indentation of comments and pass the failing test case.
