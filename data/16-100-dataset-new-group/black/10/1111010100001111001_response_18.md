The buggy function fails to correctly handle the logic for partially consuming a prefix up to a specified column number. The `wait_for_nl` condition does not properly reset when encountering a newline character, and the calculation of the `current_column` is incorrect when encountering tab characters.

The cause of the bug is that the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being properly reset when encountering a newline character, and the logic to handle tab characters for calculating the `current_column` is missing.

To fix the bug, we need to properly reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline character and adjust the logic for calculating the `current_column` when encountering tab characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Calculate the remaining spaces to the next tab stop
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
        current_line += char
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values and fix the identified bugs.
