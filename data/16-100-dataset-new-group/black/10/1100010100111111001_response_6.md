The cause of the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that the logic for handling indentation is incorrect. The function incorrectly handles the case where the current column is less than the target column. 

The inaccuracy is in the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column`, where it does not consider the scenario when `current_column` is greater than `column`. This leads to the wrong output and failing tests.

To fix the bug, the condition in the `if` statement should be adjusted to `if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column` to ensure that the correct logic is applied when determining if the target column has been reached.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:  # Adjusted condition
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
