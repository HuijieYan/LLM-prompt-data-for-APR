Based on the runtime values and types of variables and the GitHub issue, it seems that the issue is related to the incorrect handling of indentation when there are tabs in the input file.

The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely occurring because the function does not properly handle tab characters when calculating the current column. This leads to incorrect indentation behavior, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle tab characters and calculate the current column based on the tab width. Additionally, the function should ensure that the indentation for comments is preserved after a dedent, particularly when using a mix of spaces and tabs.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Assuming a tab width of 4 spaces
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function properly handles tab characters and calculates the current column based on the tab width. This should address the indentation issues reported in the GitHub issue.
