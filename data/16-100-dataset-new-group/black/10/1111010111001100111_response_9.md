The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, the function is failing to handle the indentation correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for tracking indentation levels and handling newline characters.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation when processing the prefix string, leading to incorrect consumption and separation of the prefix and the remaining string.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately track the indentation level and handle newline characters, ensuring that the consumed prefix retains the correct indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_indent = 0
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_indent < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_indent = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_indent += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_indent += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            # indent is finished
            break
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function now correctly handles the indentation and newline characters, ensuring that the consumed prefix retains the correct indentation level.

This should address the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the failing test for comment indentation is resolved.
