### Bug Analysis

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, but it fails to handle the indentation correctly when encountering comments. The issue reported on GitHub describes how this bug is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This indicates a problem with handling the indentations in the presence of comments.

### Error Locations

The cause of the bug could be related to how the function handles indentation, especially when encountering comments. The logic for `wait_for_nl` and its interaction with the handling of spaces, tabs, and newlines might be causing the incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause

The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the logic related to tracking the current indentation level (`current_column`). When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function fails to correctly adjust the indentation level for the comment, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix this bug, the function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the indentation when encountering comments, especially after a dedent. This may involve re-evaluating the logic related to tracking the current indentation level, handling spaces, tabs, and newlines, and adjusting the `wait_for_nl` flag appropriately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling newlines and adjusting the current indentation level has been revised to correctly handle the comments and dedents. This update should address the bug reported and ensure correct indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
