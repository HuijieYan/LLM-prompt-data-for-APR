The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to produce the expected output because the logic for updating the `wait_for_nl` variable is incorrect. The intention of the logic is to correctly set `wait_for_nl` to True when encountering a non-space character, indicating the end of an indentation or a non-empty line, and to set `wait_for_nl` to False after reading a newline character. However, the current logic fails to account for the case when a single line of comments exists after the end of an indentation, leading to the incorrect overall logic and returned result.

To fix the bug, update the logic inside the for loop to account for the case when a single line of comments follows the end of an indentation, and ensure that the `wait_for_nl` variable is updated correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip():
                        lines.append(current_line)
                    else:
                        current_column = 0
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
