### Bug Fix Strategy
The issue seems to be related to the indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs, so the cause of the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function might be related to handling tab characters differently from spaces.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the indentation of comments is handled correctly, especially when using tab characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assume tab equals 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, I've added a check to properly handle tab characters with an assumed equivalent of 4 spaces. This should ensure that the indentation of comments is handled correctly regardless of the type of whitespace used.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing tests.
