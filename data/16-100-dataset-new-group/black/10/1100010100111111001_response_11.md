The bug seems to be causing the function to incorrectly handle the indentation and newline characters when consuming the prefix string. It fails to correctly keep track of the indentation level and to separate lines based on the given column value.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation and newline characters and separates the lines based on the given column value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
