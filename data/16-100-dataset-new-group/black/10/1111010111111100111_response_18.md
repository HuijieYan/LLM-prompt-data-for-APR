## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line += char
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By restructuring the conditions and logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we ensure that the indentation and processing of characters are handled correctly. This corrected version takes into account the length of the expanded line when determining if the comment should be indented. This should resolve the issue raised on GitHub and pass the failing tests.
