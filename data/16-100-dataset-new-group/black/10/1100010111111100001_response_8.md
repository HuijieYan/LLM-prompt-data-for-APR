The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not handle the case when `wait_for_nl` is `True` and the current character is neither a space, a tab, nor a newline character. In this case, the function should reset `wait_for_nl` to `False` to move on to the next line.

To fix this bug, we need to add an `else` condition at the end of the `for` loop to reset `wait_for_nl` when this case occurs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    # Reset wait_for_nl when the loop finishes
    wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
