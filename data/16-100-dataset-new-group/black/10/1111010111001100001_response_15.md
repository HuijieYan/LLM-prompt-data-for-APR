Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output variable values, the bug appears to be caused by the incorrectly handled newline character. The current logic does not properly handle the newline character and does not update the current column properly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the newline character should be adjusted to reset the current column to 0 and to properly append the current line to the list of lines.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This version should handle the newline character correctly and update the current column and lines list as needed.
