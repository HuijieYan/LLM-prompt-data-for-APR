The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling indentation and comment lines appropriately, and this leads to incorrect output. The function incorrectly consumes lines, fails to handle multi-level indentation properly, and doesn't consider the comment line's indentation. This causes the failing test to produce an assertion error, indicating a mismatch between expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify and discard the leading indentation, handle different types of whitespace (spaces, tabs), and consider the indentation of the comment line. This can be achieved by iteratively parsing the input prefix and handling different cases, such as whitespace, tab, newlines, and analysis of indentation levels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '#':
                lines.append(current_line + prefix[prefix.index('#'):])
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function handles different cases by properly accounting for the indentation of each line, including comment lines, and returns the expected output. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
