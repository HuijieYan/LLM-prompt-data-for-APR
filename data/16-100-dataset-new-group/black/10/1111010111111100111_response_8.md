                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)

                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8  # Changed from 4 to 8 to correctly account for tab spacing
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The bug was caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters when calculating the current column. Adjusting the calculation for tab characters from 4 to 8 ensures that the indentation is correctly accounted for when using tabs.

By implementing this change, the function now correctly handles the indentation and should pass the failing test.

After making these changes, the function should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it now correctly handles indentation for comments after a dedent, as described in the GitHub issue.
