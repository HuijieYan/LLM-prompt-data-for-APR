## The corrected version of the function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Explanation
The bug occurred because the `else` block was not handling the case when `char` was a newline character correctly. Instead of resetting the `current_column` and adding the `current_line` to the `lines` list, it was trying to find the indent level, causing incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, I added a condition to the `else` block to handle the newline character, reset the `current_column` and add the `current_line` to the `lines` list.

With this correction, the function should now handle the cases of tabulated comments after a dedent correctly and pass the failing test.
