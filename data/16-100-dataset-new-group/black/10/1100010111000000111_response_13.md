## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Bug Analysis and Correction
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to handle the indentation of comments in the input code. The function is a part of the `blib2to3` module.
2. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.
3. The bug causes comments to be indented incorrectly after a dedent, especially when tabs are used for indentation. This aligns with the failing test that checks for correct comment indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the column when encountering a tab character. We should subtract the current column position modulo 4 from 4 to handle the indentation correctly with tabs.
5. The corrected version of the function adjusts the calculation for tab characters to ensure the correct handling of indentation, especially when tabs are used.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should now handle the indentation of comments correctly, resolving the reported issue and passing the failing test.
