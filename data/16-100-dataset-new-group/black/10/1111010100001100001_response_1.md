The cause of the bug is due to the comparison of the current_column with the specified column value in the if condition within the wait_for_nl block. The function returns the result without taking into account the case when the end of the line is reached without matching the specified column.

To fix the bug, we need to update the if condition to check if the end of the line is reached without matching the specified column, and if the prefix has been consumed entirely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        consumed = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    consumed = True
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                consumed = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        if not consumed:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
