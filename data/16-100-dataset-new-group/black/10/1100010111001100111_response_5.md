The issue mentioned on GitHub describes a problem where the indentation for comments changes incorrectly after a dedent in the input file, specifically when using tabs.

Upon analyzing the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it's evident that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not handling tab characters correctly, resulting in incorrect indentation for comments.

The buggy function does not handle tab characters properly to calculate the current column, leading to incorrect indentation. This is because the function only increments `current_column` by 4 for each `\t` character encountered, which is not accurate for all cases.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to properly handle both space and tab characters to calculate the current column for indentation. This can be done by updating the logic within the function to accurately track the current column based on both space and tab characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 7) // 8 * 8
        else:
            current_column += 1

        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 3
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected logic, the function should now handle both space and tab characters accurately, resulting in correct indentation for comments after a dedent. This should address the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass.
