The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation level when waiting for a new line. It does not properly reset the current column when encountering a new line or spaces/tabs. This leads to incorrect calculation of the prefix to consume.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling new lines and indentation levels. We should reset the current column when encountering a new line or whitespace characters and properly update the wait_for_nl flag accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
        if current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the indentation level and new lines are properly handled, and the prefix is consumed correctly based on the given column.
