To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, it seems that the function is not handling the indentation correctly for comments. The function is not updating the indentation level for comments after a dedent, which is causing the indentation to be incorrect.

To fix this, we need to update the logic that handles the indentation and wait for a new line after a dedent. We should track the correct indentation level for comments and adjust it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    is_comment = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column and is_comment:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                is_comment = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == '#':
                is_comment = True
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version, we have added a check to track whether the current line is a comment. If it's a comment, we adjust the indentation level accordingly. We also update the logic to handle the wait_for_nl flag and indentation level correctly.

This should address the issue with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent and ensure that the function processes the prefix correctly.

After the correction, we should run the failing test again to ensure that it now passes. If it passes, we can address the GitHub issue by providing the corrected code to the user who reported the bug.
