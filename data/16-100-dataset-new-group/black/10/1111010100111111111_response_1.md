Based on the information provided, it seems that the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. The issue occurs when the input file uses tabs instead of spaces.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the indentation level of comments after a dedent. This results in the incorrect reformatting of comments, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation level when processing comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip():
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should handle the indentation level correctly and ensure that comments are formatted as expected, especially in scenarios where the input file uses tabs.

This correction should address the issue described in the GitHub report and ensure that the function passes the failing tests, satisfying the expected input/output values.
