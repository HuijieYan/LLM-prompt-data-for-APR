## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Analysis of the buggy function
The function '_partially_consume_prefix' aims to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column value. It processes each character in the prefix string and keeps track of lines, columns, and indentation.

## Identified potential error locations
1. The condition `if wait_for_nl` is not properly handling the else case when the character is not a newline.
2. In some if conditions, the corresponding character should be added to the current line before updating the column value.
3. The indentation check using `elif char == '\n':` and `else:` is not functioning as intended.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The bug in the original function causes incorrect handling of lines, columns, and indentation, leading to incorrect extraction of the prefix string.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Adjust the logic within the wait_for_nl condition to properly handle characters other than newline.
2. Ensure that the current character is added to the current line before updating the column value.
3. Handle the '\n' case separately to properly reset the column and current_line values.

By addressing these issues, the function should correctly consume the prefix string based on the specified column value.
