The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is being used to consume a prefix of characters based on indentation level and newlines. The function seems to be incorrectly identifying the indentation level and is not handling newlines properly.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the logic for handling whitespace characters, tabs, and newlines. The logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables also seems to be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the indentation level and prematurely consuming the prefix, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling whitespace, tabs, and newlines needs to be revised to accurately track the column position and waiting for newlines before consuming the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
By revising the logic for handling whitespace characters, tabs, and newlines, and properly tracking the column position, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
