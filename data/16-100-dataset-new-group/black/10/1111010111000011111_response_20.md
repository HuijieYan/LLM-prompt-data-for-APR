The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing the indentation issue with tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The potential error location within the function is the logic for handling tabulated comments and dedenting.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the tabulated comments after a dedent, resulting in incorrect indentation when using tabs instead of spaces.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the tabulated comments and dedenting logic.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 8) // 8 * 8  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the tabulated comments and dedenting logic, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
