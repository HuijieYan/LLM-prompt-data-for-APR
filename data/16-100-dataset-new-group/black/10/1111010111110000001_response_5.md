The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing the test `test_comment_indentation` to fail. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix and return the remaining unparsed portion, but it is not handling indentation properly, causing incorrect output.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for handling whitespace characters and waiting for a newline.
The cause of the bug is failing to properly handle the indentation level when encountering different whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) and waiting for a newline.

To fix the bug, a strategy involves revising the logic for handling whitespace characters and the process of waiting for a newline. Properly accounting for different types of whitespace characters and ensuring correct tracking of the column will address the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column + 4) // 4 * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with tracking column position, handling different whitespace characters, and waiting for a newline, allowing the function to correctly parse the prefix and produce the expected output.
