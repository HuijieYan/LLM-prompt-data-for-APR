The issue in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it incorrectly handles the cases where a line ends with a comment and a different indentation level follows. This causes the function to return incorrect results in certain scenarios.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that checks for the end of a line with a comment. We need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case when there is a comment at the end of a line followed by a lower indentation level.

Here's the updated and corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this updated version, the function correctly handles the cases where a line ends with a comment, ensuring that the indentation level is properly considered.

This updated version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
