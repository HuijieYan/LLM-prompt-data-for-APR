The cause of the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it does not handle the indentation of comments correctly. This causes incorrect indentation when the input file uses tabs, which is the issue reported in the GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent".

To fix the bug:
- We should update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments and ensure that it works correctly for input files using tabs.

The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is provided below:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip().startswith("#"):  # Check if the line is a comment
                current_column = 0  # Reset the current column for comments
            else:
                current_column = 0  # Reset the current column for regular lines
                wait_for_nl = True  # Indent is finished
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the buggy test function `test_comment_indentation` passes.
