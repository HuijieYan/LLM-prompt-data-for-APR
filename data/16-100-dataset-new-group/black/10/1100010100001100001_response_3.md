The bug in the '_partially_consume_prefix' function appears to be related to incorrect handling of the 'wait_for_nl' variable, which is used to determine if the function should wait for a new line character before proceeding. This is causing issues with identifying the correct prefix to return.

The strategy for fixing this bug involves adjusting the conditional statements inside the for loop to properly handle the cases when a new line character is encountered.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            continue

        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
