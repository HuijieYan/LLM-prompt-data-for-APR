## Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely failing to properly consume the prefix in certain scenarios, leading to incorrect results in the test_comment_indentation test.

## Potential Error Locations
The cause of the bug could be related to the logic for handling indentation, new lines, and spaces. There may be issues with tracking the current column and waiting for a new line.

## Cause of the Bug
The buggy function fails to handle the indentation and new lines properly, resulting in incorrect output and causing the failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation and new lines needs to be carefully examined and adjusted as necessary. Additionally, the function should be thoroughly tested to ensure it produces the correct output for various scenarios.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            break
        current_line += char

    if current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
