The cause of the bug is that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is incorrectly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent. It fails to correctly adjust the comment indentation when encountering a dedent, leading to incorrect formatting.

One potential strategy for fixing this bug is to carefully review the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to ensure that it correctly handles the indentation for comments after a dedent. Additionally, the function should be tested using input cases that specifically involve tabulated comments after a dedent to verify that the bug is resolved.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # handle newline and adjust the current column and line
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should handle tabulated comments after a dedent correctly and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
