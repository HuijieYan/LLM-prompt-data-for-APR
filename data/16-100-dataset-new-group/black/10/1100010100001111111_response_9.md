The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, particularly when tabs are used. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely responsible for this behavior.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and the expected values, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters. The variable `wait_for_nl` seems to be causing the issue, as it is not being properly reset when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset when a newline character is encountered and correctly update the `current_column` based on the indentation characters (spaces and tabs).

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        else:
            current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

In this corrected version, we reset the `current_line` and `current_column` appropriately when encountering a newline character. We also update the `current_column` based on the type of indentation character encountered (space or tab).

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and newline characters, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
