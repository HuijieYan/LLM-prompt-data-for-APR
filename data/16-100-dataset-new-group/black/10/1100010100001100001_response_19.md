The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables as it iterates through the prefix string. As a result, it is not correctly capturing the prefix to be consumed.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` and `current_line` variables are updated for each character in the `prefix` string, and that the correct prefix is returned based on the given `column` value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column == column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
