The buggy function "_partially_consume_prefix" is failing because it fails to properly modify and return the prefix string. It does not correctly remove spaces or tabs from the beginning of each line, and it does not update the 'current_column' value correctly.

To fix the bug:
1. Initialize the variable 'res' to an empty string at the beginning of the function.
2. Update the 'current_column' value based on the number of spaces or tabs encountered.
3. Correctly construct the 'res' by adding the lines to it as they are consumed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    res = ""
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res += current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                res += current_line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            res += current_line
            current_line = ""
                
    return res + ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, it should pass the failing test.
