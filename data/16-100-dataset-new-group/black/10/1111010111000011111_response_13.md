## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent, resulting in incorrect formatting.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic to handle the indentation of comments properly after a dedent.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the beginning of a new line and updates the current_line and current_column variables accordingly.

By implementing the corrected version of the function provided above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output values. This will resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
