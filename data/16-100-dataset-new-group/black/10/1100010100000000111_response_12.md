The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function is incorrectly handling the indentation and newline characters when processing the prefix input.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The handling of wait_for_nl and current_column variables may not be correctly capturing the column and indentation changes.
2. The logic for checking for '\n' characters and managing the lines list may be incorrect.

The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling tabulated comments after a dedent, which leads to incorrect indentation of comments. This is in line with the GitHub issue, where the user reported that Black reformats the code incorrectly when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to accurately handle the tabulated comments and their indentation after a dedent. This can be achieved by ensuring that the current_column and wait_for_nl are updated correctly, and the lines list tracks the correct indentation levels.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version, we have adjusted the logic for updating current_column and handling the newline character to ensure that tabulated comments are correctly indented after a dedent.
