The issue with the buggy function appears to be that it is not properly handling the indentations and counting the number of spaces or tabs. This is evidenced by the failing test case "test_comment_indentation" which checks the indentation of the comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation logic, leading to incorrect indentation levels being returned.

To fix the bug, the function should properly account for the indentation caused by spaces, tabs, and newlines.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
This corrected version ensures that the function correctly tracks the column and indentation levels, allowing it to properly handle the test case "test_comment_indentation".
