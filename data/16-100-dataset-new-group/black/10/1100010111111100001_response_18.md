The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic to handle whitespace and newlines. When a comment is encountered, the function does not correctly check if the comment's column is less than the specified column, leading to incorrect handling of the comment indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a comment is encountered, it is checked whether its column is less than the specified column. If that's the case, then the function should return the prefix string sliced up to that point.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should correctly handle the indentation of comments and pass the failing test.
