The bug in the function _partially_consume_prefix is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs. The current implementation of the function fails to correctly handle the indentation and line breaks, leading to the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the indentation and line breaks, ensuring that the comments are indented correctly regardless of the presence of tabs or spaces.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(lines) > 0 and len(lines[-1]) < column:
                    last_line = lines.pop()
                    lines.append(last_line + current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            pass
        elif char == '\t':
            pass
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line:
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ''
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. It properly handles the indentation and line breaks, ensuring that the comments are indented correctly regardless of the presence of tabs or spaces.

By using this corrected version of the function, the failing test for comment indentation should pass, and it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
