Based on the buggy function and the expected input/output values, we can identify the potential errors in the code. The function is expected to split a prefix string into two parts: the lines that fit within a certain column and the remaining prefix. However, there are several issues in the code, such as incorrect handling of indentation and new lines.

The cause of the bug is mainly due to the incorrect handling of indentation and new line characters. When encountering indentation or new line characters, the function does not reset the current line and column correctly, causing incorrect splitting of the prefix.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the function to correctly handle the indentation and new line characters, and reset the current line and column appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
