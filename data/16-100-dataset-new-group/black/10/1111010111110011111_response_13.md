To fix the bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class. The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation and comments in the input code. This leads to incorrect reformatting of the code when using tabs instead of spaces.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the logic that handles the indentation and comments, particularly around the `wait_for_nl` condition and the indentation tracking.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles the indentation and comments when using tabs, leading to incorrect reformatting of the code. This results in failing the test case `test_comment_indentation`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling indentation and comments and ensure that it correctly tracks the current column and handles the wait for a new line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    continue  # Skip the rest of the iteration
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Update column by 4 for tab
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and comments, leading to the expected reformatting of the code when using tabs, and passing the failing test case.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub as well, ensuring that the indentation is correctly handled for tabulated comments after a dedent.
