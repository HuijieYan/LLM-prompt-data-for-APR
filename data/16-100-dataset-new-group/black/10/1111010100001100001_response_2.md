The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it's not correctly updating the variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` as it iterates through the `prefix` string.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the cases of indentation properly, leading to incorrect values for the variables and incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` according to the different conditions while iterating through the `prefix` string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This should fix the bug by correctly handling the different conditions while parsing the `prefix` string.
