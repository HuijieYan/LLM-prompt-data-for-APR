The issue described in the GitHub is related to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs. This suggests that the _partially_consume_prefix function might be incorrectly handling tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect indentation.

Upon analyzing the runtime input/output variable values and the expected input/output variable values, it is clear that the current implementation of the _partially_consume_prefix function is not correctly handling the indentation. In multiple cases, the current_column and the wait_for_nl flags are not being updated correctly, leading to incorrect indentation of the comments.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for handling tab and space characters and properly update the current_column and wait_for_nl flags.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        if (char != ' ' and char != '\t' and char != '\n') or (char == '\n' and current_column >= column):
            break
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs, as described in the GitHub issue.
