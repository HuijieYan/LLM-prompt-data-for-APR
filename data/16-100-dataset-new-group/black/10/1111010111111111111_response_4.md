The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not handling the indentation correctly, leading to unexpected output when reformatted by the Black library.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs, thus resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
