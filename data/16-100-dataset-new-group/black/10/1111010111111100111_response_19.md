The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class and is responsible for consuming a prefix string up to a certain column. The function processes each character in the prefix string and appends it to the `current_line` variable until it encounters a specific condition. Based on the condition, the function either appends the current line to the `lines` list and resets the `current_line` variable, or it sets the `wait_for_nl` flag to True if a whitespace or tab is encountered. 

From the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, it is evident that the indentation for comments is being incorrectly changed after a dedent when using tabs instead of spaces.

The potential error in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when processing the indentation of the comment. The logic is not correctly handling the indentation levels for comments when encountering tabs and spaces.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the scenarios where the input uses tabs for indentation.


To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle indentation with tabs and spaces. We should consider the tab indentation level as 4 spaces, similar to Python's behavior, and adjust the logic accordingly.


Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_line += ' ' * num_spaces
                current_column += num_spaces
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to properly handle both tabs and spaces for indentation, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
