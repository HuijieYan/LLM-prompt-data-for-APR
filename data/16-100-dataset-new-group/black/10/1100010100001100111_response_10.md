The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs instead of spaces. This results in incorrect formatting for the comments after a dedent.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditions and logic within the for loop where the characters of the prefix are being processed. The function is not handling the indentation and newline characters correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly track and handle the indentation and new line characters, especially when tabs are involved. This results in incorrect identification of the expected indentation level and subsequently leads to incorrect processing of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation and new line characters, especially when tabs are involved. This can be done by accurately tracking the current column position based on both spaces and tabs, and correctly identifying when a new line starts and ends. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the input file uses tabs for indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_column += 1
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the indentation and newline characters, and also accounts for cases where the input file uses tabs for indentation.
