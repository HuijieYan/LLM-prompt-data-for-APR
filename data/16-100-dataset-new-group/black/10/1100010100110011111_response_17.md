The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` contained in the code block you provided. The function is intended to consume a prefix of characters and determine if there is an indentation change, returning the consumed lines and the remaining prefix. The function is used within the context of formatting code, specifically related to handling indentation and comments.

The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output. It seems that when the function encounters a comment after a dedent, the indentation may be changed incorrectly.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function handles the indentation and comments, particularly with tabs. It appears that the logic for handling comments and tabulated indentation after a dedent is not working as expected, leading to the incorrect reformatting of the input code.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be adjusted to properly handle tabulated indentation and comments after a dedent. This may involve refining the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a new line, as well as handling the specific cases where comments and tabulated indentation interact.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the current_column by 4
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1
            # check for comment
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of tabulated indentation, ensures that the comment is properly handled, and addresses the specific case of incorrect reformatting after a dedent when a comment is present.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
