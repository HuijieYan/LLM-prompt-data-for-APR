The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. However, the function has several issues that cause it to incorrectly handle indentation and comments, as reported in the GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent".

Potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect handling of indentation levels for spaces and tabs.
2. Incorrect handling of waiting for a new line character.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation levels and comments, especially when using tabs in the input file. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect reformatting of the code.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the function correctly handles indentation for spaces and tabs and maintains the correct indentation level for comments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Change the tab size to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function properly handles both spaces and tabs for indentation. Additionally, it ensures that the correct indentation level is maintained for comments. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
