The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used. This is causing the indentation to be changed incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, ensuring that it preserves the original indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab length
        elif char == '\n':
            # Preserve original indentation for comments
            current_line = '\t' * (current_column // 4) + current_line.lstrip()
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I've added code to preserve the original indentation for comments by adjusting the current line based on the current_column for '\n' characters. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
