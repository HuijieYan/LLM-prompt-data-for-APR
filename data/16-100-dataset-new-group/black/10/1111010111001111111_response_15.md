## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Driver(object):

    # the corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if not wait_for_nl and current_column > 0:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The bug in the original function lies in the incorrect handling of indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. To fix this bug, the corrected function includes the following changes:

1. Added a check for whether the character is a newline after a dedent, and if so, adjusted the indentation to match the expected behavior.
2. Modified the handling of tabs to properly calculate the current column after a tab character.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in GitHub regarding incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
