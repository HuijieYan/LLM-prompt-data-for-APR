The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be part of the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file which is responsible for handling indentation and line parsing in a Python codebase.

The function `test_comment_indentation` within the `tests/test_black.py` file is failing because it is testing the indentation of comments, and the `fs` function is not formatting the comments correctly based on the input.

The GitHub issue describes how the indentation of comments is being incorrectly changed by the `Black` library when using tabs in the input file.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is handling tab characters and newlines. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the indentation level at which the comment should be placed, leading to incorrect formatting.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab characters and newlines in a way that accurately captures the intended indentation level for comments.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Update the column count for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset the column count for newline
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, I have updated the column count for tab characters and newline characters to ensure that the function accurately tracks the indentation level, which should resolve the incorrect formatting of comments after a dedent.
