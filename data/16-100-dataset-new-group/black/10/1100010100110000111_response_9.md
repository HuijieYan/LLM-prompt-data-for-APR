### Potential error location within the buggy function:
- The issue seems to be related to the handling of indentation and comments after a dedent in the input file.
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not correctly handle the indentation and comment alignment.

### Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The `current_line` and `lines` variables are not being updated correctly when handling the indentation and comments. This results in incorrect alignment and indentation for the comments after the dedent. As a result, the test case fails.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- The function should correctly detect and handle the indentation levels and comments after a dedent.
- The logic of updating `current_line` and `lines` based on the indentation and comments should be reviewed and corrected.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to handle the waiting for a new line and updating the `current_line` and `lines` variables accordingly, this corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
