The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a flaw in the logic for handling tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is designed to consume a prefix string while keeping track of the indentation level and processing comments. However, it fails to correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent, resulting in incorrect indentation for those comments. This is due to the current logic not accounting for the specific case of tabulated comments after a dedent when processing the prefix string.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent and ensure that the indentation is preserved correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # Check for tabulated comment after dedent
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks for tabulated comments specifically after a dedent, and ensures that the correct indentation is maintained.

This should address the issue reported on GitHub and correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent while preserving the indentation.
