The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it incorrectly handles the cases where there are leading spaces or tabs and a comment starts on a new line with a different indentation. When consuming characters from the `prefix`, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of the comment relative to the starting column, leading to incorrect line construction and column tracking.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be formulated to correctly handle indentation and new lines. We can modify the function to track the current line's indentation and correctly handle the start of a new line with different indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        current_indentation = 0
        
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_indentation += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_indentation += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                current_indentation = 0
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line += ' ' * max(0, column - current_column)
                    current_column = column
                    
                if current_indentation > 0:
                    current_line += ' ' * current_indentation
                    current_column += current_indentation
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        
        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With the corrected function, it should handle the indentation and correctly construct the lines as expected. After applying this fix, the failing test should pass, and the runtime input/output values should match the expected input/output values.
