## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Explanation
The bug in the original function is caused by the incorrect handling of the newline character. When a newline character is encountered, the function updates the `current_column` and adds the `current_line` to the `lines` list, regardless of the preceding context. This results in incorrect indentation when the function encounters a tabulated comment after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function includes a modification to handle the newline character properly. The function now appends the `current_line` to the `lines` list when a newline character is encountered, and resets the `current_line` and `current_column`. This ensures that the correct indentation is maintained for tabulated comments after a dedent.

By implementing this fix, the corrected function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
