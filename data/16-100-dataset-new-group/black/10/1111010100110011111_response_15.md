## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The bug was causing the incorrect handling of comments after a dedent with tab indentation. The issue arose due to the 'wait_for_nl' condition not resetting when encountering a new line after a dedent, resulting in incorrect indentation for comments.

To fix the bug, I modified the 'elif char == '\n'' block to remove the 'wait_for_nl = False' condition and made sure to reset 'current_column' whenever a new line is encountered.

The corrected version should now properly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent with tab indentation, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
