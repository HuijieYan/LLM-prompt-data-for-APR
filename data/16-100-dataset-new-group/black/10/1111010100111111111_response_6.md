Based on the analysis and the failing test, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of indentation and comments after a dedent. The function "_partially_consume_prefix" is handling the prefix incorrectly, leading to the indentation not being preserved for comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent. The logic for managing the current_line and current_column needs to be adjusted to handle the correct indentation for comments.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for tracking the current_line and current_column, particularly when encountering a new line or a comment.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, ensuring that the expected output is achieved for the failing test. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
