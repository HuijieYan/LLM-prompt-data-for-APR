The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is failing because the `assertFormatEqual` is comparing the expected and actual output strings and the actual result is not as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling tabulated indentation correctly within the `prefix` string. This leads to incorrect indentation of comments in the output, resulting in a failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tabulated indentation within the `prefix` string.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + '\n'  # Include newline in result
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Determine the number of spaces to add based on the column and current_column
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function now handles tabulated indentation correctly and should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
