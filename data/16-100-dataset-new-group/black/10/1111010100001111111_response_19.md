The issue reported on GitHub seems to be related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, which is likely caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file.

Looking at the runtime and expected values, it's clear that the function is not correctly handling the indentation when encountering tab characters ('\t'). The current implementation only increments the `current_column` by 1 when encountering a tab, but it should increment it by 4 to account for the tab width.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the function to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the column. We can replace the logic for handling tabs with the correct tab width of 4.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    continue  # Skip the rest of the iteration
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Increment by 4 for each tab
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle tab characters and adjust the `current_column` by 4 for each encountered tab, addressing the reported issue on GitHub.
