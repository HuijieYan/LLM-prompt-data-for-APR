The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation in the input text, which is causing an AssertionError in the failing test.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the logic that identifies the start of a new line and processes the indentation. The function is not correctly handling the case where there is a comment after an indented block.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly resetting the `current_column` and `current_line` variables when a comment is encountered after an indented block. This causes the incorrect handling of indentation in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for processing the indentation, and update the function to correctly handle the case where there is a comment after an indented block.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            pass
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and correctly handle the indentation and comments in the input text.
