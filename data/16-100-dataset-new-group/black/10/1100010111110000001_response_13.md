The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation and consuming the prefix before a comment in the `test_comment_indentation` test. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation, resulting in an incorrect assertion in the failing test.

The potential error locations within the function include the handling of whitespaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the logic for waiting for a new line before processing the comment.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation when waiting for a new line before processing the comment. This results in incorrect output, causing the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling whitespaces, tabs, and newlines needs to be adjusted to correctly identify the indentation level and wait for a new line before processing the comment.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now correctly handle the indentation and wait for a new line before processing the comment. This should allow the function to produce the correct output and pass the failing test.
