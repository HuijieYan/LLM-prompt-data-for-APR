The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and indentation. The function incorrectly calculates the current column when encountering tabs, resulting in incorrect indentation when processing code with tab characters.

The function should correctly handle tab characters and update the current column based on the tab's position. Additionally, it should reset the current line and column when encountering a newline character.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately track the current column when processing tab characters and reset the current line and column when encountering a newline.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces represented by the tab
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should accurately handle tab characters and maintain the correct indentation, thereby resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
