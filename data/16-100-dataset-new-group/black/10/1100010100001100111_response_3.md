The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is incorrectly handling the indentation of comments in the presence of tabs, leading to the issue described on GitHub.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of indentation related to tab characters. The function does not properly account for tab characters when calculating the current column. This leads to incorrect indentation behavior, especially when processing comments.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tab characters, both in terms of incrementing the current column and when checking for the end of a line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # adjust column based on tabs
        else:
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 3  # adjust for spaces after tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles tab characters and adjusts the current column and line accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when using tabs.
