The buggy function has several issues, including incorrect logic and variables not being updated properly. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The issues in the original function have been fixed as follows:
1. Updated the logic for handling newlines within the `wait_for_nl` condition.
2. Updated the logic for handling indentation to accurately track the current column count.
3. Moved the update of `current_column` and `current_line` outside the conditional statements to ensure they are updated in all cases.

These changes ensure that the function accurately tracks the prefix input, handles newlines and indentation properly, and returns the correct values for the expected cases.
