The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a part of the `Driver` class. The function is intended to handle the indentation of comments in a codebase. However, it has a bug where the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional checks for space, tab, and newline characters. These checks are used to calculate the indentation level, and there might be a mistake in the logic, leading to incorrect indentation.

The cause of the bug is related to the mishandling of indentation for comments after a dedent. When the input file uses tabs, this buggy function incorrectly changes the indentation of comments, leading to the reported issue on GitHub.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve carefully reviewing the logic for handling indentation levels and correcting any miscalculations that result in incorrect indentation for comments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    prefix_len = len(prefix)
    i = 0
    while i < prefix_len:
        char = prefix[i]
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        i += 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I have utilized a `while` loop to iterate over each character in the `prefix` string. This allows for better control and tracking of the current index within the string. The logic for handling whitespace and newline characters has been adjusted to ensure accurate calculation of the indentation level.
