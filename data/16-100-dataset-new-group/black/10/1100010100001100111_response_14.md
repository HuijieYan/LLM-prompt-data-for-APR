The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of tabs and spaces in the input prefix. The function is intended to consume a prefix of whitespace characters from the input string, up to a certain column, and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, the current implementation fails to correctly handle tab characters and their contribution to the column count.

Based on the provided runtime values and types, we can see that the function fails to correctly handle the tab characters, resulting in incorrect column counts and line breaks. This causes the function to incorrectly return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the handling of tab characters within the function. We should update the logic for calculating the column count and handling tab characters to ensure that they are correctly accounted for.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = (current_column + 4) // 4 * 4  # Calculate the next tab stop
            spaces_to_add = next_tab_stop - current_column
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column = next_tab_stop
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we added a separate branch to handle tab characters, calculating the next tab stop and adding the appropriate number of spaces to the current line. This ensures that the column count is correctly updated when encountering tab characters.

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the input prefix and accurately determine the consumed prefix and remaining prefix.

This should address the reported issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
