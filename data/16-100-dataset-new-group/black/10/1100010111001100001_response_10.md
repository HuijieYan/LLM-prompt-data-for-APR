The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function causes the incorrect removal of the prefix from the input string, leading to incorrect calculation of the indentation. This results in failing the test cases, as the function does not correctly handle the removal of the prefix from the input string.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic for the calculation of the current_column and wait_for_nl flags to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix and returns the remaining string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
