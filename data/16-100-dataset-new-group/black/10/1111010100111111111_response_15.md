The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with handling the indentation of comments when the code includes tabs instead of spaces. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation for comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect formatting of the code, as observed in the failing test and reported GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is related to how the function tracks the current column position and handles different characters. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4, instead of considering the actual position of the tab in the code. This leads to incorrect indentation calculations and ultimately, incorrect formatting.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the `current_column` based on the actual position of the tab. This will ensure that the function accurately tracks the column position and maintains proper indentation for comments after a dedent, as observed in the failing test and reported issue on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust current_column for tab
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes a new handling for tab characters, where the `current_column` is adjusted based on the actual position of the tab. This ensures that the function accurately tracks the column position, leading to correct indentation for comments after a dedent. This version should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
