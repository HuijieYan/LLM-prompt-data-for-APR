The bug in the given function is that the code does not correctly identify the comment line and remove the extra indentation.

In the failing test, we notice that the indentation before the comment in `contents_tab` is `4` instead of `0` as expected. This implies that the function is not correctly removing the leading whitespace characters before the comment.

One strategy to fix this bug is to reset the `current_column` to 0 when a new line is encountered instead of just updating it with the number of spaces or tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0  # Reset the column count
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and remove the extra leading spaces or tabs before the comment. The function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
