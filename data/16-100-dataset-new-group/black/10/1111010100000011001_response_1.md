The bug in the given function appears to be in the logic for checking and handling new lines and indentation. It seems that the function is not correctly updating the variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` based on the input prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling new lines and indentation in the prefix, as well as appropriately update the variable values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                # Unexpected empty line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
