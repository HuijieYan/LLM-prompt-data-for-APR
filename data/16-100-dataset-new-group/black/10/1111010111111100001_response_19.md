The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has issues that cause it to fail in certain test cases. The purpose of this function is to consume a prefix and return a substring and the remaining part of the prefix, given a column value to track indentation.

The potential error in this function happens when preparing the `current_line` by accumulating individual characters from the `prefix`. After accumulating each character, the current line and its details are manipulated according to certain conditions. When a specific character, such as a space or a newline, is encountered, the function updates the `current_column` and sets a flag named `wait_for_nl` as True to indicate that a newline is expected next. Unfortunately, there are inaccuracies in this handling of characters that lead to an incorrect buffer manipulation.

The bug originates from the handling of indentation and newline. Specifically, when a tab or space character is encountered, the function doesn't correctly handle the update of the `current_column`. Also, when a newline character is reached, the function doesn't correctly update the `current_column` and other related variables.

A strategy for fixing the bug involves meticulously tracking the `current_column` and `current_line` updates based on the encountered characters, ensuring that the indentation and newline handling is accurate.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue  # added to skip the remaining checks after processing a new line
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # adjust current_column to the next tab stop
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # update line and indentation details
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # added to reset the flag after processing a new line
        else:  # when encountering a non-indentation character
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code ensures that the `current_column` is correctly updated for space, tab, and newline characters. Additionally, it accurately resets the `current_column`, `current_line`, and the `wait_for_nl` flag after processing a newline character. After applying this correction, the failing tests should pass without the earlier issues.
