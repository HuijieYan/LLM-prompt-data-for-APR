### Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix and return the consumed lines and the remaining unparsed prefix based on a given column value. However, the function fails to handle the indentation and keeps incorrectly consuming the prefix, leading to an incorrect outcome when reformatting code with tab indentation and comments.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the reformatting of code with comments and tab indentation. The error message indicates that the reformatting does not match the expected result, which is attributed to the incorrect handling of indentation when processing comments.

The runtime input/output values show that the function fails to correctly handle tab indentation and comments, leading to incorrect calculations of line consumption and remaining unparsed prefix.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `if` conditions that handle tab and space characters and the logic for consuming lines with comments.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of tab indentation and comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering tab characters or new lines within comments, the function does not correctly reset or update the current column and wait for new line flag, leading to incorrect line consumption and unparsed prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the handling of tab indentation and comments needs to be revised within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, the logic for updating the current column and waiting for a new line should be modified to correctly handle tab characters and comments.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Update current column to next multiple of 4 for tab
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version, the logic to update the current column for tab characters is revised to align with the expected behavior. Additionally, the handling of new lines based on indentation and comments is adjusted to ensure proper line consumption and unparsed prefix.
