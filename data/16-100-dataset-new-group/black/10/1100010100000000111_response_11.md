## Analysis
The bug is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely responsible for incorrectly changing the indentation of comments.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The logic for handling indentation with spaces and tabs may not be correct.
2. The condition for checking `if wait_for_nl` might be incorrect.
3. The logic for updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables might be faulty.

## Cause of the Bug
The function fails to correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, leading to an incorrect output when the input file uses tabs. The root cause of the bug is the mishandling of tabulated comments in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent by updating the logic for indentation with tabs and spaces, correcting the condition for checking `wait_for_nl`, and ensuring the proper management of the `current_column` and `current_line` variables.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            # changed the logic for spaces to match tabs
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # updated the logic for tabulated comments
            current_column += len('\t')
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
- The logic for handling spaces and tabs is updated to ensure correct indentation.
- The condition for checking `wait_for_nl` is corrected to address the issue of tabulated comments after a dedent.
- The logic for updating `current_column` is adjusted to handle tabulated comments properly.
