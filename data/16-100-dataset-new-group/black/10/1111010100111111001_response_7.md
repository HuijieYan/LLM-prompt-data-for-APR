The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix based on a given column value and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, there are several issues with the current implementation, such as not properly handling the case when the current column is less than the specified column.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly check if the current column is less than the specified column before returning the consumed prefix. 
Additionally, the function also fails to properly handle cases when the prefix contains newlines and whitespaces.

To fix the bug, a new strategy should be implemented to keep track of the current column position and correctly consume the prefix based on the specified column.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    if char == ' ':
                        current_column += 1
                    elif char == '\t':
                        current_column += 4
                    else:
                        current_column += 1
            else:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the edge cases and correctly consume the prefix based on the specified column. This should address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
