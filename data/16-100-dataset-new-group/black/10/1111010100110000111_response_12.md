### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming the prefix and handling the indentation for comments. The error message indicates that the comment indentation is incorrectly changed after a dedent, which aligns with the GitHub issue description. This suggests that the bug may be related to the handling of comments and their indentation in the function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling comments and their indentation.
2. Incorrect calculation of indentation levels after dedent.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs. This results in incorrect formatting of the comments as observed in the failing test. The issue described in the GitHub post aligns with this behavior, indicating that the buggy function is causing the problem.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling comments and their indentation to ensure correct alignment after dedent.
2. Adjust the calculation of indentation levels to account for the presence of comments.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust the calculation for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling comments and their indentation remains the same, but the calculation for tabs has been adjusted to ensure the correct indentation levels. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub post.
