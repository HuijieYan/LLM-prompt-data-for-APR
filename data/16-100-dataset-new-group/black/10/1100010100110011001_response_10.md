The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the failing test. The function is not handling the indentation correctly, which leads to an incorrect output. Specifically, the function does not handle the case where 'char' is a newline character and 'wait_for_nl' is True, which results in incorrect output regarding the current_line and lines variables.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to handle the indentation and newline characters correctly. We should also carefully consider the value of the 'wait_for_nl' flag to ensure that it behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the indentation and newline characters correctly and produce the expected output. This should resolve the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
