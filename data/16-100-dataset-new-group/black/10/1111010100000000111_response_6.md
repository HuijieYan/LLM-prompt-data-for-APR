Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The logic for tracking and handling the current column and line seems to be incorrect.
2. The conditional checks for wait_for_nl and char are not properly nested and may not be accurately capturing the intended behavior.

Cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling the current column and line when dealing with tabs and new lines. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, as noted in the GitHub issue.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The strategy for fixing the bug would involve re-implementing the logic for tracking the current column and line, particularly when encountering tab characters and new lines. Additionally, the conditional checks for wait_for_nl and character types need to be revised to capture the correct behavior.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = ['']
    current_column = 0
    current_line = 0
    line_started_with_tab = False

    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append('')
            current_column = 0
            current_line += 1
            line_started_with_tab = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            line_started_with_tab = True
        else:
            if line_started_with_tab:
                lines[current_line] += '\t' * (current_column // 4)
                current_column %= 4
            lines[current_line] += char
            current_column += 1

    if current_column < column:
        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    else:
        return ''.join(lines), prefix

```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues with tracking the current column and line while handling tabs and new lines. It accurately captures the intended behavior and should resolve the indentation issue mentioned in the GitHub problem.
