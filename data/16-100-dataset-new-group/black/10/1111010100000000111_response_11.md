The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class, defined in the file `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`. This function is used to process a prefix string and deal with indentation and newline characters. However, the function has some issues with handling the tab character and its effect on the indentation of comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the tab character when calculating the current column for indentation. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the tab character's effect on the current column for indentation. This may involve modifying the logic for incrementing the `current_column` variable when encountering a tab character in the input string.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust current_column based on tab width (e.g., 4 spaces)
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have added a specific handling for the tab character (`\t`) by incrementing the `current_column` by the appropriate number of spaces (e.g., 4 spaces). This will ensure that the function correctly tracks the current column for indentation, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
