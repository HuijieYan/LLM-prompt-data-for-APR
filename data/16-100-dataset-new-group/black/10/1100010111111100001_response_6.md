The bug in the provided function is related to the handling of indentation and new lines. The function is intended to partially consume a given prefix string up to a specified column limit, but it fails to properly handle new line characters and indentation levels.

The function incorrectly handles the case of encountering a new line character while waiting for a new line, resulting in incorrect indentation tracking. This causes the function to return the incorrect prefix content.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the cases of encountering new line characters and maintaining the correct indentation levels.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1
            if current_column >= column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function handles new line characters and indentation properly, ensuring that it correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column limit.

With this correction, the provided failing test should now pass without any assertion errors.
