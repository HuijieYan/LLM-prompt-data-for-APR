## Analysis of the buggy function:
The function '_partially_consume_prefix' is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. It processes the string character by character, updating the current line and column values accordingly.

## Potential error locations:
1. The condition for checking if the current character is a newline ('\n') is not correctly implemented.
2. The logic for updating the 'current_column' value is not handling tabs ('\t') correctly.
3. The 'wait_for_nl' flag is not being appropriately reset after encountering a newline character ('\n').

## Cause of the bug:
The condition for checking if the current character is a newline ('\n') is not properly implemented, leading to incorrect handling of the 'wait_for_nl' flag. Additionally, the logic for updating the 'current_column' value does not account for tabs, resulting in incorrect column calculations.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition for checking if the current character is a newline ('\n') to ensure that the 'wait_for_nl' flag is set and reset correctly.
2. Modify the logic for updating the 'current_column' value to account for tabs ('\t') as well.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
