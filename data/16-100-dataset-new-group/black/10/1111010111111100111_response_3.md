The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has several issues leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with comments and indentation. 

The main issue is related to the handling of indentation and wait_for_nl flag. The function fails to properly track the current line and column position when encountering newlines, spaces, or tabs, leading to incorrect behavior when processing comments and indentation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the current line and column position, handles newlines, spaces, and tabs, and correctly processes comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = [""]
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append("")
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append("")
                current_column = 0
            else:
                lines[-1] += char

            if current_column >= column and char != '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

In the corrected version, we initialize `lines` with an empty string to represent the first line. We update the `current_column` and handle newlines, spaces, and tabs correctly. Additionally, we properly handle the `wait_for_nl` flag to ensure correct processing of comments and indentation.

This corrected version should address the indentation and comment processing issues in the original function and resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
