### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function fails to correctly track the column position and wait for a new line after dedent. This results in incorrect indentation handling for comments, especially when tabs are used.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by improving the logic for tracking the column position and waiting for a new line after a dedent. Additionally, special attention needs to be given to handling tabulated comments to ensure correct indentation.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Assuming a tab equals 8 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function improves the logic for tracking the column position and waiting for a new line after a dedent. It also includes special handling for tab characters to ensure correct indentation. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

By making these modifications to the function, it should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
