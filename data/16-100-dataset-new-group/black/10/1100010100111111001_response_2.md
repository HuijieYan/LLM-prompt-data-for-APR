The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function appears to be related to the handling of tab characters and spaces. When the function encounters a tab character, it incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4, which is incorrect. Instead, it should increment `current_column` by 1 for each tab character encountered.

Additionally, the logic for handling newlines and indentation seems to be incorrect, as evidenced by the failing test cases where the indentation of comments is not properly preserved.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle tab characters, spaces, and newlines, and correctly track the current indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Increment current_column by 1 for each tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)  # Add the current line to the list of lines
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0  # Reset current_column at the start of a new line
        else:
            current_line += char  # Add non-indentation characters to the current line
    lines.append(current_line)  # Add the last line to the list of lines
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should properly handle indentation and newlines, and preserve the correct formatting of the input text.
