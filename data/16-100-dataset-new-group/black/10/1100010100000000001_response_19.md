The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix() is intended to process a prefix string and return the consumed portion along with the remaining portion. The function maintains a current line, column, and flag to wait for a new line.

Upon analyzing the function, a potential error location is the handling of the 'wait_for_nl' flag and the updating of the current column.

The bug in the function occurs when the 'wait_for_nl' flag is set to True, indicating that the function is waiting for a new line. If the current character is not a newline character, the function does not reset the 'wait_for_nl' flag to False, causing it to remain in the state of waiting for a new line indefinitely.

To fix the bug, the 'wait_for_nl' flag should be reset to False when the condition for waiting for a new line is not met.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag when the new line is encountered
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag for a new line
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
