## Analysis
The `test_comment_indentation` test fails with an AssertionError, indicating that the `assertFormatEqual` method is comparing two different strings and finding them not equal.

## Bug Locations
1. The logic for indentation detection might be incorrect.
2. There could be a bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when processing the prefix string.

## Bug Cause
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to have a bug when handling the prefix string for indentation. This bug results in incorrect detection of indentation levels, leading to a mismatch in the formatted output and the expected content.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The logic for handling indentation and consuming the prefix string needs to be reviewed and corrected. The function should accurately identify the indentation levels and handle them appropriately to ensure the correct comparison between the formatted content and the expected output.

## Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
By updating the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as shown above, we have addressed the potential issues with the handling of indentation and the consumption of the prefix string. This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_comment_indentation` passes successfully.
