To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to address the incorrect handling of indentation and the unexpected behavior when encountering comments after a dedent. Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, it is clear that the bug is related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the scenario where a comment is encountered after a dedent. This results in incorrect handling of the comment indentation, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle comments after a dedent, ensuring that the indentation is preserved as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                lines[-1] = lines[-1].rstrip() + ' ' + current_line.lstrip()
                current_line = ""
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected function, we added a condition to handle the case where a comment is encountered after a dedent. If the current line starts with a comment ('#'), we modify the previous line in the 'lines' list to concatenate the comment with proper indentation. This ensures that the comment is correctly indented when a dedent occurs.

With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the indentation for comments after a dedent correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and making the failing test pass.
