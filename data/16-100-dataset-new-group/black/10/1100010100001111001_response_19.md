The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column, but due to incorrect logic, it is not functioning as expected. The function incorrectly updates the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags based on the characters in the prefix before correctly identifying the column.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly updates the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags based on the characters in the prefix before correctly identifying the column.

To fix the bug, the function should update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags based on the characters in the prefix after correctly identifying the column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all the given cases.
