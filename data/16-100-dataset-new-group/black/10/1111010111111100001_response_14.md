The bug in the provided function is in the logic to identify the end of indentation. When a non-whitespace character is encountered, it sets the `wait_for_nl` flag, assuming the end of indentation, which is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that when encountering a non-whitespace character, the function incorrectly assumes that it marks the end of the indentation and sets the `wait_for_nl` flag to `True`, expecting a new line. This is incorrect because the end of indentation is actually defined by the position of the column, not any specific character.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly track the length of whitespace used for indentation and compare it to the specified column. When the column position is reached, that marks the end of the indentation block.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_indent = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_indent += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_indent += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_indent = 0
        if current_indent >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function correctly consumes the prefix string up to the specified column position, taking into account spaces, tabs, and newlines as needed for proper indentation.
