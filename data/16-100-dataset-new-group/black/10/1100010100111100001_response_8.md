The bug in the provided function is causing an indentation error when attempting to consume a prefix string based on a specified column value.

The bug occurs because the current_column is not properly updated when encountering a new line or when processing indentation.

To fix the bug, the code needs to check for the current_column value before adding a line to the list of lines and reset the current_column value to 0 when encountering a new line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column to 0
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
