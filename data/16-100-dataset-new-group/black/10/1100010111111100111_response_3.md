To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic for handling the indentation-related conditions and the handling of new lines.

The cause of the bug is that the `wait_for_nl` condition is not properly being reset, causing incorrect handling of the indentation.

The strategy for fixing the bug includes:
1. Resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline character.
2. Adjusting the logic for handling the indentation and tab characters.
3. Making sure that the `current_line` is correctly added to the `lines` list when a newline is encountered.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above corrected version of the function, the test `test_comment_indentation` should pass without any assertion errors. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
