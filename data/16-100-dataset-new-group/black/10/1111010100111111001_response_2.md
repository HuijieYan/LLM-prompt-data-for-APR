The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that when the function encounters a newline character, it doesn't reset the `current_line` and `current_column` variables. This leads to incorrect handling of the prefix string, which causes the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to reset the `current_line` and `current_column` variables when encountering a newline character, regardless of whether or not it was an unexpected empty line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n' or current_column >= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        remainder = prefix[len(res):]
                        return res, remainder
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    if current_column >= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        remainder = prefix[len(res):]
                        return res, remainder
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character, we ensure that the function correctly handles indentation and comments, which should fix the failing test cases.
