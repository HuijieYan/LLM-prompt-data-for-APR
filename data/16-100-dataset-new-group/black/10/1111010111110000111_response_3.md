Based on the provided context, it seems that the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling tab characters correctly, resulting in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. This is consistent with the failing test and the error message provided, as well as the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, possible locations of the error could be the handling of tab characters and the logic for determining the correct indentation level.

One strategy for fixing the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function would be to ensure that the function correctly tracks and applies the indentation level for tab characters, ensuring that comments are correctly aligned after a dedent. This can be achieved by revisiting the logic for tab character handling and adjusting the indentation level accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of tab characters has been adjusted to calculate the new indentation level based on the current column position and the tab size. This should resolve the issue with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when using tabs.

This corrected version should be able to pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
