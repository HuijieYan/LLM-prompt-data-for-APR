The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation of the comment in the test file. It appears to be a problem with how the function is tracking whitespace and newline characters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the indentation when consuming the prefix, so it fails to correctly identify and process the comment indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling whitespace, tabs, and newline characters in the `prefix` string.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now properly handle the indentation and other whitespace when consuming the prefix. This should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
