## Corrected Version

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the newline character and the indentation of comments after a dedent. To fix this, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the newline characters and updates the current line and column appropriately.

In the corrected version, I have added a line to reset `current_line` to an empty string when encountering a newline character. This ensures that the current line is reset after each newline, preventing the unexpected indentation behavior observed in the failing test.

This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function behaves as expected.
