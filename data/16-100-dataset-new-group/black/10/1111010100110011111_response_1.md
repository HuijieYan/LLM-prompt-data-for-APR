The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing an issue with the indentation of comments after a dedent in the `driver.py` file. It is not handling the indentation of comments correctly and is altering the expected output.

The potential error location within the function is the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a newline character.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and waiting for a newline character, leading to incorrect output.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a newline character within the function. It may require adjusting the conditions and variable updates to properly handle the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue mentioned.
