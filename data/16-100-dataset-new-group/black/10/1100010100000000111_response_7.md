The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be incorrectly handling the indentation in the input file. This is related to the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent", where the user experiences incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

The potential error location within the function is the handling of tabulation ('\t') and the wait_for_nl condition. It seems like the function is not correctly tracking the current column and is failing to maintain the correct indentation level.

The bug is caused by the function incorrectly handling tabulation and not properly maintaining the current column position, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we can revise the logic for tracking the current column position and handling tabulation. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the function correctly maintains the correct indentation level for comments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_add
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected function, we have revised the logic for handling tabulation by calculating the number of spaces needed to reach the next tab stop. Additionally, we have removed the `wait_for_nl` condition and directly handled the indentation level based on spaces and tabs encountered. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs in the input file.
