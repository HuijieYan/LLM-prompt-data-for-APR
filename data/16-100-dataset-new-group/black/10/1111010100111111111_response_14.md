## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # fix the unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the else block in the for loop to include `lines.append(current_line)` and `current_line = ""` under the case of `char == '\n'`, we ensure that the current line is correctly added to the `lines` list and reset for the next line. This change aligns with the expected behavior and fixes the bug described in the GitHub issue.
