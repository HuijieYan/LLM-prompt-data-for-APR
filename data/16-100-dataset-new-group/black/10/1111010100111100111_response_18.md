## Correction
The issue is related to the indentation of comments not being properly maintained after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. 

### Bug Cause
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic bug that causes the incorrect handling of comments' indentation after a dedent operation. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not set to True when encountering newlines in the middle of indentation, causing the function to misinterpret the indentation level and incorrectly handle comments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `wait_for_nl` flag needs to be properly set and reset when encountering different types of characters. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies when to wait for a newline and when to reset the indentation level.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Checking the column condition
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjusting column with tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:  # Checking the column condition
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # Setting the wait_for_nl flag

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function includes a proper handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and conditions to check column levels. With these modifications, the function should accurately handle comments' indentation after a dedent, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
