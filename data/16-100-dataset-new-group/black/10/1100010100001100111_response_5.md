The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix by processing it character by character until certain conditions are met. However, the function has several issues that could be causing the problem reported in the GitHub issue.

First, the function is not properly handling the indentation levels for tabulated comments. This can be seen from the runtime input/output values where the indentation level is not being accurately captured, leading to incorrect behavior when processing the prefix.

Secondly, the function is not correctly handling the `wait_for_nl` condition, leading to unexpected behavior when encountering new lines in the input prefix.

Lastly, the function does not correctly handle the case when the input prefix is empty, as it would not properly return the remaining prefix.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the indentation levels for tabulated comments, ensure the correct handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition, and have a proper return value in the case of an empty prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    if not prefix:
        return '', ''
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues with the original code and should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
