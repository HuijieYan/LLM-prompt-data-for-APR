The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation calculation correctly, leading to incorrect results in the test function `test_comment_indentation`. The function should correctly calculate the column position and handle the indentation characters tabs ('\t') and spaces (' ').

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect calculation of the current_column for spaces and tabs.
2. Mishandling of the newline character and empty lines.

The buggy function is failing the test because it does not correctly handle the indentation calculation when consuming the prefix of the input.

To fix the bug, the strategy is to update the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newline characters to accurately calculate the column position and handle indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column < column:
                return ''.join(lines) + current_line, prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
