The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the input prefix string up to the specified column. It then returns the consumed portion of the prefix and the remaining portion.

Potential error locations:
- Incorrectly processing indentation and newline characters.
- Inappropriately updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables.

Cause of the bug:
The function fails to correctly handle some indentation and newline scenarios, leading to incorrect consumed prefix and remaining prefix.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Revise the way the function handles indentation and newline characters and ensure that the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables are appropriately updated.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
    
    consumed_prefix = ''.join(lines)
    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(consumed_prefix):]
    return consumed_prefix, remaining_prefix
```

By updating the function to correctly handle indentation and newline characters, the corrected version should address the identified issues and pass the failing test.
