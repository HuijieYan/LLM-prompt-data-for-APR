The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in the logic control for consuming the prefix. The function is not properly handling the indentation level of the text and the comment, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, the indentation of the comment line is not being accounted for, causing the function to return the wrong result.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for tracking the current indentation level and properly consume the prefix up to the specified column value.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                indentation = min(len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip()), current_column)
                if indentation < len(current_line):
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line[:indentation]
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
