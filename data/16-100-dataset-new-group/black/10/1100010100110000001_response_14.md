The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` and it is used to partially consume the prefix of a string up to a certain column. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is an issue with indentation handling, specifically for comments.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the `elif char == ' '` and `elif char == '\t'` blocks, because the current_column is not being properly incremented. This could lead to incorrect handling of whitespace and tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments when consuming the prefix of a string. It fails to maintain the expected indentation level, resulting in incorrect output and failing the test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation for comments and maintain the correct column count.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Fix: adjust current column based on the current position
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the `elif char == '\t'` block has been updated to properly adjust the `current_column` based on the current position, ensuring correct handling of indentation. This correction should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
