The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation to consume the prefix up to a certain number of columns. The bug seems to be caused by the way the function handles tab characters and new lines, and the logic for raising the `wait_for_nl` flag.

The incorrect indentation handling results in the wrong prefix being returned, leading to the failing test case for comment indentation.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle tab characters and new lines and update the logic to track the current column number as it consumes characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            continue
        current_line += char
        if current_column >= column:
            break
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
```

The updated function correctly handles tabs and new lines, updates the current column count, and makes sure to break when the specified column limit is reached. This should resolve the failing test case, and the function should now behave as expected.
