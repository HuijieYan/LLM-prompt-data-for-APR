The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. This issue is related to the incorrect processing of tabs, which leads to incorrect indentations for comments.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the incorrect handling of tabs and the logic for determining the wait_for_nl flag.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle tab characters when calculating the current column for indentation. This leads to the incorrect handling of indentation levels, especially for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately calculate the current column taking into account both spaces and tabs. Additionally, the logic for wait_for_nl should be adjusted to correctly handle the end of lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                if wait_for_nl:  # Check for wait_for_nl first
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should accurately handle both spaces and tabs for calculating the current column and correctly manage the wait_for_nl flag.
