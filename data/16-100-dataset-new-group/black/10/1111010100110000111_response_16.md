### Explanation
The bug in the original function is that when the comment is encountered, the function doesn't handle the indentation properly, leading to incorrect behavior in how the comment is formatted.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the return statement within the if condition where the comment is encountered to check if the next character after the consumed prefix is a newline character. If it is, include the newline character in the result; otherwise, proceed as before.

The corrected version of the function includes this check to properly handle the indentation and formatting of the comment.

This update is in line with the GitHub issue reported, addressing the incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. With this fix, the function will correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent and pass the failing test.
