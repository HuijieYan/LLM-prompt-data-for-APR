The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation level for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function does not properly handle tab characters and does not adjust the column count accordingly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the column count, accounting for both spaces and tabs, and handle the indentation of tabulated comments correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # calculate the remaining spaces to reach the next tab stop
            spaces_to_tab_stop = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_tab_stop
            current_column += spaces_to_tab_stop
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles tab characters and adjusts the column count accordingly. It addresses the issue of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
