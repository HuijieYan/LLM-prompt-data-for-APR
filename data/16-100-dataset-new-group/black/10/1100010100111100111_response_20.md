The bug in the provided function is causing incorrect behavior in the indentation of comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to handle the indentation of lines based on a given column value, but it fails to do so correctly.

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles waiting for a new line after encountering a non-whitespace character. It does not correctly handle the cases where the comment lines are being processed.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately track the current column and handle the indentation based on the given column value. Additionally, the logic for waiting for a new line and processing the comment lines should be adjusted to ensure the correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the indentation of comment lines correctly based on the given column value. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
