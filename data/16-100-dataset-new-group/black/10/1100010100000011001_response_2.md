The buggy function has several issues that need to be addressed. 

1. The `lines` list is never being cleared or reset between different prefix strings, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is incorrect as it does not account for the possibility of leading whitespace in the prefix string.
3. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not correctly reset after encountering a newline character.

To fix these issues, we need to make the following changes:
- Reset the `lines` list at the beginning of the function.
- Update the condition for checking the column to handle leading whitespace correctly.
- Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag after encountering a newline character.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and (current_column - len(current_line.lstrip())) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
