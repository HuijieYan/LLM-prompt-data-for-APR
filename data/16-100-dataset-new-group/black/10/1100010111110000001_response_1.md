The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is parsing a string to consume an indentation prefix and return the remaining part of the string. The issue seems to be with the handling of tabs and spaces in the input string.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are likely the conditional statements for checking tab, space, and newline characters. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation characters and their impact on the `current_column` variable.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking if the function correctly formats the input strings with different types of indentation. The error message indicates that the actual output of the function does not match the expected output for a specific input string.

The cause of the bug is likely that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the indentation characters, resulting in incorrect consumption of the prefix and incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies and consumes the indentation characters in the input string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            current_line += char
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected changes in the function include updating the conditionals to correctly handle the indentation characters and track the current column position. With these changes, the function should now correctly consume the prefix and return the remaining part of the string, passing the failing test.
