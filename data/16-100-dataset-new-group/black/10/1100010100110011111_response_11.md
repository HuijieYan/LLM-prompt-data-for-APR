## Corrections for the buggy function

Looking at the buggy function, it seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation of comments, especially after a dedent. This is causing the failing test case to produce the wrong output and is also related to the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The problem lies in the logic of handling tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is not properly tracking the column position and is incorrectly handling the indentation of comments.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic for tracking the column position and handling tabulated comments after a dedent.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust column based on current position
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl flag
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes the logic to properly handle the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent. It adjusts the column position based on the current position when encountering a tab character.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
