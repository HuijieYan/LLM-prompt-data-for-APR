The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, specifically when using tabs instead of spaces. This relates to a GitHub issue where the Black library incorrectly changes the indentation for comments after a dedent.

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to occur when processing tabs and newlines. It fails to maintain the correct indentation level and does not handle tabs and newlines properly, causing incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation level and process tabs and newlines according to Python's indentation rules.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
