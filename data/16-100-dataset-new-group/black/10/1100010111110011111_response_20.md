The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with the handling of indentation and comments. The function is used to consume the prefix of a string up to a given column, while preserving whitespace and newline characters. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, resulting in incorrect formatting.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying and preserving the indentation level of the comments. This leads to the incorrect handling of comments after dedent, as observed in the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly identify and preserve the indentation level of comments after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_size = 4  # Set the tab size
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_size  # Increase the current_column by tab_size
        elif char == '\n':
            # check for indent continuation on the next line
            if len(current_line.strip()) > 0 and current_line.strip()[-1] == '#':
                current_column = len(current_line.expandtabs(tab_size))  # Update current_column with expanded tab_size
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected function, we have added logic to handle the indentation of comments properly after a dedent. We also introduced the `tab_size` variable to explicitly define the size of a tab for consistent handling.

With these changes, the function should now correctly preserve the indentation level of comments after a dedent and pass the failing test. This in turn satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
