The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation level comparison. It is failing to properly handle the mixture of space and tab characters for indentation.

The bug is causing the `assertFormatEqual` test to fail, resulting in an `AssertionError` with a specific comparison of the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to accurately handle indentation based on both spaces and tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for i, char in enumerate(prefix):
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += prefix[i:]
            break
        
    for char in prefix[i:]:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should handle space and tab indentation properly, and the failing `assertFormatEqual` test should now pass.
