The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` variable, which is not being reset to `False` after a newline is encountered. This leads to incorrect behavior when moving to the next line.

To fix the bug, the `wait_for_nl` variable needs to be reset to `False` after the newline is encountered, and the logic for updating the `current_column` and `lines` variables needs to be adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Increment by nearest multiple of 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl on encountering newline
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
