To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the _partially_consume_prefix function. The issue is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent.

The problem arises from the handling of wait_for_nl and the logic around checking for newline characters and updating the current_column. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

To address this, we can refactor the logic for handling indentation and newlines. We need to ensure that the indentation for comments after a dedent is preserved correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            wait_for_nl = False
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by ensuring that the wait_for_nl flag is appropriately updated. Additionally, the logic for updating current_column and handling newlines is adjusted to preserve the correct indentation for comments after a dedent.

With this correction, the function should now handle the indentation for comments after a dedent correctly, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
