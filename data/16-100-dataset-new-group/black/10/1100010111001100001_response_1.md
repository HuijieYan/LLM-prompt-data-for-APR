The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the indentation level of the comments in the input text. The current implementation does not consider the indentation level after encountering a new line character. This causes the function to return incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the indentation level while iterating over the characters of the input prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected implementation properly handles the indentation level after encountering a new line character and should now pass the failing test.
