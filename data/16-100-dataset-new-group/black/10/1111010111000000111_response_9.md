The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the indentation for tab characters and spaces, leading to incorrect formatting. This issue is reported on GitHub with the title "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent".

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the handling of tab characters, spaces, and newlines, which are not correctly updating the `current_column` and `current_line` based on the input prefix.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the indentation of comments properly, especially when using tab characters. This results in incorrect formatting when the input file uses tabs, as reported in the GitHub issue.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly handle the indentation of tab characters and spaces, and ensuring that comments are properly indented based on the input prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Update current_column based on the number of spaces
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By using this corrected version of the function, the indentation of comments should be handled properly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
