The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely due to how it handles indentation levels in the input text. It seems to be using the number of spaces and tabs to keep track of the current column, but the logic for handling indentation and line breaks is faulty.

The function is intended to consume a prefix of a string up to a certain column number. However, it seems to mishandle the indentation when there are comments, leading to incorrect results.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for tracking the column and handling different types of indentation (spaces, tabs) and line breaks. Additionally, the function should be checked to ensure it correctly handles comment lines.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming 1 tab = 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column and not current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This version should handle the indentation and line breaks correctly, ensuring that it processes the prefix string up to the specified column number while ignoring comment lines.
