## Identifying the potential error locations:
1. The `wait_for_nl` variable is not being reset to `False` after the current line is processed.
2. The `current_line` should be added to `lines` and reset to an empty string after the newline character is encountered.

## Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file to partially consume the prefix to a certain column. The bug causes incorrect behavior when encountering tabulated comments after a dedent in the input file. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` also confirms the incorrect behavior. The GitHub issue further explains the problem and provides a sample input that showcases the issue with tabulated comments.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` variable to `False` after the current line is processed.
2. Add the `current_line` to the `lines` list and reset it to an empty string after encountering a newline character.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl to False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add the current_line to lines
            current_line = ""  # Reset current_line to an empty string
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl to False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
