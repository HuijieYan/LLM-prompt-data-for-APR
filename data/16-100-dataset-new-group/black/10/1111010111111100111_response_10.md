To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, the logic for handling the indentation levels and tracking the lines needs to be adjusted.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation levels when there are comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect indentation for the comments, especially when the input file uses tabs.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the logic for handling different types of characters (tabs, spaces, newlines, and others) and ensuring that the indentation levels are correctly tracked when processing the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tabs = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                tabs = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            tabs += 1
            current_column = (tabs * 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            tabs = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function now correctly handles the tabs, spaces, and newlines in the prefix, ensuring that the indentation levels are accurately tracked.

This corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
