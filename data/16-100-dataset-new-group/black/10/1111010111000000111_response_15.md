The potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The condition `if wait_for_nl:` should check for `char == '\n'` instead of `if char == '\n':`. Otherwise, it will incorrectly trigger the conditional block.
2. The logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` condition seems to be incorrect, as it doesn't handle indentation after the first occurrence of a new line character.

The cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test, and the GitHub Issue information:

The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handling the indentation and new line characters, which leads to incorrect reformatting of the indentation for comments after a dedent. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` provides sample input code using tabs, and the GitHub issue details a similar scenario where the input file uses tabs and results in incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.

A strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Update the condition for `wait_for_nl` check to correctly handle new line characters.
2. Revise the logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` condition to ensure correct indentation after the occurrence of new line characters.

The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # reset current_line and wait_for_nl
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version should now handle the new line characters and indentation correctly, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report.
