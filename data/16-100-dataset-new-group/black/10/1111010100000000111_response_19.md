Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The issue mentions that when running the code on a codebase that uses tabs, the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent.

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be responsible for the incorrect handling of indentation. The function iterates through the characters of the input prefix and is supposed to handle indentation, spaces, tabs, and new lines. However, it does not correctly handle the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent, resulting in the issue described in the GitHub problem.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to specifically address the handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. This may involve modifying the logic for handling tabs and comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_char = '\t'  # Define the tab character

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == tab_char:  # Check for tab character
            current_column += 4  # Increase the column by 4 for a tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I added a variable `tab_char` to define the tab character (which is assumed to be '\t'). Then, I modified the logic to correctly handle the tab character and adjust the column position accordingly. This modification should address the issue described in the GitHub problem.
