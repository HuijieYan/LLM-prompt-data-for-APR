The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and indentation for comments after a dedent. This is consistent with the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the handling of tab characters and the wait_for_nl condition. These areas may be causing the incorrect behavior when processing the prefix string.

The bug appears to be caused by the function not correctly handling tab characters and their corresponding indentation. This results in the incorrect behavior when processing comments after a dedent, leading to the failing tests described.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are handled properly and that the behavior of comments after a dedent is consistent with the expected output. This may involve modifying the logic for processing tab characters and adjusting the wait_for_nl condition to ensure the correct behavior for comments at different levels of indentation.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces to add for the tab
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check for tab characters and modified the logic to handle the indentation correctly. This should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected, passing the failing tests and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
