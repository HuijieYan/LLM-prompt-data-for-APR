## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    if lines:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Explanation:
The bug was caused by the incorrect handling of the wait_for_nl condition and the unexpected empty line condition. The original implementation did not correctly handle the indentation and caused the comments to be incorrectly indented after a dedent.

I have updated the condition to correctly handle the case of an unexpected empty line and modified the logic to ensure that the comment indentation is maintained after a dedent.

The corrected version of the function now correctly identifies the indentation and preserves the comment indentation after a dedent, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
