The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix and return the consumed part of the prefix as well as the remaining part. However, it seems to be failing to properly handle the indentations and comments, as seen in the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`.

The potential error locations within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function are:
1. The logic for handling spaces and tabs seems to be incorrect.
2. It does not properly handle the comment lines.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and comment lines, which is leading to incorrect results when consuming the prefix.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Proper logic for identifying and handling comments and indentation is necessary to address this issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the `test_comment_indentation` should pass without any assertion errors.
