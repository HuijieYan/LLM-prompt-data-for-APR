The potential error location in the `partially_consume_prefix` function is the logic for handling tab characters and the indentation level (`current_column`). The issue posted on GitHub indicates that the library, when running on code with tabs, is incorrectly changing the indentation for comments after a dedent.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of tab characters in the function, leading to incorrect indentation levels and formatting issues for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling tab characters and update the calculation of the current indentation level.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_indent = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_indent < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_indent = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':  # space characters
                current_indent += 1
            elif char == '\t':  # tab characters
                current_indent = (current_indent // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':  # newline
                current_indent = 0
            else:  # other characters
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, the handling of tab characters and the calculation of the current indentation level have been adjusted. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.
