To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to update the logic for handling the indentation and new lines within the input prefix. The current implementation is not correctly handling the indentation and comment alignment, leading to incorrect results.

One approach to fixing the bug is to carefully track the indentation level and adjust the comment indentation accordingly. We also need to handle the cases where the input prefix contains tabs instead of spaces.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        else:
            if not wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

This corrected version includes handling for both spaces and tabs, tracks the indentation level correctly, and adjusts the comment indentation based on the input prefix.

By using this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
