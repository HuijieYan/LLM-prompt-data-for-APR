The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely not handling indentation correctly, as indicated by the error message showing a difference in indentation for the comment line in the failing test. This suggests that the function is not correctly consuming the prefix and adjusting the indentation as expected.

One potential source of the bug is the logic for handling indentation levels with spaces and tabs. Another potential issue could be related to the handling of new lines and indentations within the loop.

The buggy function is not correctly handling the indentation in the prefix string. Based on the error message, it seems to be treating the comment line as indented when it shouldn't be. This suggests that the function is not correctly updating the indentation level when encountering different types of characters (e.g., spaces, tabs, newlines).

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle indentation using the specified column value. Additionally, it should properly handle newlines and update the indentation level accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, I've updated the logic for handling spaces and tabs to correctly adjust the `current_column` value. I've also modified the logic for handling newlines to correctly append the current line to the `lines` list. Lastly, I've adjusted the conditional statements to correctly check for the indentation level and handle the wait for a newline.
