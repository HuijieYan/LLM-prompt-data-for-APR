Based on the analysis, it appears that the buggy function does not properly handle the indentations and newline characters, resulting in incorrect output. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset in cases where it should be, leading to incorrect indentation processing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `for` loop to properly handle the cases where indentation changes and newlines occur. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset at the appropriate times.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the indentation handling is fixed, and the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset appropriately. This should address the issues seen in the failing tests and ensure that the function produces the correct output for all cases.
