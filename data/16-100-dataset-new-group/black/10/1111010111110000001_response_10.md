The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume whitespace prefixes and preserve line indentation. The function is being called when formatting source code, which involves modifying the indentation and whitespace in the source code.

However, the function seems to have a bug related to detecting and preserving the whitespace prefixes correctly, causing the test case `test_comment_indentation` to fail. The failing test indicates that the expected and actual results for formatting the source code do not match.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for detecting new lines or whitespace may not be functioning correctly.
2. The function may be incorrectly combining or splitting lines during indentation conversion.

### Cause of the Bug:
Based on the failing test and the error message, the cause of the bug is likely related to how the function handles whitespace and newlines within the `prefix` parameter. It fails to correctly account for the given indentation rules, leading to discrepancies when reformatting the source code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track whitespace prefixes and newlines. It should also properly handle indentation adjustments during line processing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the bug by properly accounting for whitespace, newlines, and indentation levels. It should now pass the failing test.
