The cause of the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be that the logic inside the `wait_for_nl` condition is not correctly handling the prefix string and updating the `current_line` and `current_column` variables.

To fix the bug, you can update the logic in the `wait_for_nl` condition to properly handle the prefix string and update the `current_line` and `current_column` variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
