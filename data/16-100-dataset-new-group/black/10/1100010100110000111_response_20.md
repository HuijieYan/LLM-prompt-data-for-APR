### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is involved in a bug that causes incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs. The error message from the failing test shows a specific example where the comment indentation is being changed incorrectly after a dedent. The GitHub issue also confirms this behavior and provides a sample input where the bug is observed.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the logic for handling whitespaces, tabs, and newlines.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the indentation level for comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly managing the indentation level for comments, especially when the input file uses tabs. This results in incorrect indentation for the comments after a dedent, as observed in the failing test and reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation level for comments after a dedent. Specifically, the logic for handling whitespaces, tabs, and newlines needs to be revised to maintain the correct indentation level for comments in the input file, regardless of whether spaces or tabs are used.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    whitespace = ""
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                whitespace = ""
        elif char == ' ':
            whitespace += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            whitespace += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            whitespace = ""
        else:
            if whitespace:
                current_line += whitespace
                whitespace = ""
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function includes the addition of a `whitespace` variable to keep track of the whitespace or tab characters encountered before the non-whitespace character. This allows the function to accurately maintain the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent, regardless of the type of indentation used in the input file.
