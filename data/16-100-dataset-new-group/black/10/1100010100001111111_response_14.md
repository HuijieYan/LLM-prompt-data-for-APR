The buggy function seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation and whitespace characters in the prefix input string. This could be the cause of the indentation issue reported in the GitHub issue. The function appears to be processing each character in the prefix string and updating the current_line and current_column variables based on certain conditions.

The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a newline character while processing the prefix string. The code sets wait_for_nl to True when it encounters a non-space/tab character, but it does not reset current_column to 0 when a newline character is found. This leads to incorrect handling of the indentation and causes the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we should reset the current_column to 0 when a newline character is encountered. Additionally, we need to reset wait_for_nl to False after processing the newline character.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset current_column and wait_for_nl
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should properly handle the indentation and whitespace characters in the prefix input string, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the expected output values provided. Additionally, it should address the issue reported in the GitHub post about incorrect indentation when using tabs.
