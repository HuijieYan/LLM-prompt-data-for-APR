## Analysis:
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix of text up to a certain column position, and return the consumed text and the remaining text. The function tracks the current line, column, and whether it is waiting for a new line.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling the wait_for_nl condition seems jumbled and could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The handling of tabs and spaces to update the current_column may not be accurate.
3. The check for the current_column against the specified column may not be correct.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely arises from the incorrect handling of new lines and the tracking of the column position, leading to incorrect splitting of the prefix.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reorganize the logic for handling the wait_for_nl condition to ensure it correctly identifies the end of a line and resets the current line and column.
2. Adjust the handling of tabs and spaces to properly update the current_column.
3. Verify the condition for checking the current_column against the specified column is accurate.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
