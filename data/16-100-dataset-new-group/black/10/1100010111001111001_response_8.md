The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag. It is not correctly being toggled when encountering a non-space character after spaces or tabs. This results in incorrect indentation tracking, leading to the function failing the test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is toggled off whenever a non-space character is encountered after spaces or tabs. Additionally, we need to correctly update the `current_column` count based on the encountered characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases by accurately tracking the indentation and processing the prefixes accordingly.
