## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Explanation of the corrected version
The original implementation has an issue when encountering a newline character. The current `current_line` is not added to the `lines` list, leading to incorrect indentation in the resulting output. To fix this, the corrected version adds `current_line` to the `lines` list when a newline character is encountered. This ensures that the correct indentation is maintained in the resulting output.

This change resolves the issue described in the GitHub bug report and will ensure that the indentation for comments after a dedent is maintained correctly, especially when using tabs in the input file.
