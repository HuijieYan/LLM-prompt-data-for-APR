The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function appears to be related to how the function handles waiting for a new line. It seems that it doesn't properly handle cases where comments at the end of a line do not align with the specified column.

The buggy function is designed to consume a portion of the prefix string based on column alignment. It seems to be working correctly for spaces and tabs, but it fails to correctly handle comments that end in a new line.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle cases where a comment ends in a new line and make sure that it aligns with the specified column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                current_line = current_line.lstrip(' ')
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = current_line.rstrip(' ')
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles cases where comments end in a new line and aligns them with the specified column. It should pass the failing test.
