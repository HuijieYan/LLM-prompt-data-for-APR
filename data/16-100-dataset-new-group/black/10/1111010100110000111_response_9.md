## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix of a code input and handle indentation of the code. The failing test and the GitHub issue both point to incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. This indicates that the bug is most likely related to the handling of tabs and the indentation logic within the function.

## Identified Potential Error Locations
1. Inconsistent handling of tab characters causing incorrect indentation
2. Logic for handling comments and indentation is not considering tab characters

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of tab characters when handling indentation, which results in incorrect formatting for comments after a dedent. The function's logic does not adequately account for tabs when determining the indentation level, leading to the incorrect output.

## Strategy for Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to consistently handle tab characters and account for their indentation level. The logic for handling comments should also be revised to consider the presence of tabs.

## Bug Fix - Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':  # use regular space width as 1
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':  # tab width as 4
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:  # check if waiting for newline
                if current_column < column:  # check if current column is less than required column
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)  # add current line to lines
                current_line = ""  # reset current line
                current_column = 0  # reset column count
                wait_for_nl = False  # reset waiting for newline
            else:
                current_column = 0  # reset column count for new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # set waiting for newline
        current_line += char  # add current char to current line
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In this corrected version, the indentation logic has been updated to consistently handle both spaces and tabs. It also ensures that comments are correctly handled after a dedent, addressing the issue reported in GitHub. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
