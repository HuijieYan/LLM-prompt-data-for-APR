The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for the incorrect handling of indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is expected to partially consume a given prefix, updating the current line, current column, wait_for_nl, and lines based on the input prefix and column. However, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, causing the reported issue on GitHub.

The bug occurs when the function encounters a tab character ('\t') in the input prefix. It incorrectly increments the current column by 4, regardless of the actual in-code representation of tabs. This causes the function to miscount the column positions, leading to incorrect indentation for comments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the tab characters correctly in the prefix and adjust the column count based on the actual representation of tabs in the code. This can be achieved by counting the number of tab characters and multiplying it by the equivalent number of spaces in the code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                # Calculate the actual column increment for tab characters
                increment = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_column += increment
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]

                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the tab characters and adjusts the current column based on the actual representation of tabs in the code.
