Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation of comments correctly when there are tabs in the input file.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not keeping track of the correct column count when encountering tabs, which leads to incorrect handling of comment indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to accurately track the column count when encountering tabs. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation of comments.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * num_spaces
            current_column += num_spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            res = ''.join(lines)
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we properly handle the counting of spaces for tab characters, ensuring that the column count is accurate. We also check for the correct indentation level when encountering a comment.

This corrected version should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and pass the failing test.
