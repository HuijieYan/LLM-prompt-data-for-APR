The bug in the function _partially_consume_prefix is due to its incorrect handling of the indentation for the commented line in the prefix. When encountering a comment, it fails to properly adjust the current column and instead waits for a newline character before handling it. This causes the incorrect handling of comments during indentation, leading to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling comments, ensuring that the column count is appropriately adjusted when encountering comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle comments within the prefix and adjust the column count appropriately, resolving the issues identified in the failing tests.
