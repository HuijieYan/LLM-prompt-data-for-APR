The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation correctly, especially in cases where there are tabs and spaces used for indentation. This causes the indentation for comments to be changed incorrectly after a dedent in the failing test `test_comment_indentation`. The function is not properly handling different scenarios of indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling indentation, tabs, spaces, and comments in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`. We need to ensure that the function correctly accounts for the indentation level and handles different types of whitespace characters.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip().find('#') < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
- When checking the indentation level for comments, we use `current_line.lstrip().find('#') < column` to account for both tabs and spaces in the indentation.
- We handle tabs by adding 4 to the `current_column` for each encountered tab character.
- The logic for handling different types of whitespace characters and comments has been revised to ensure correct behavior.

With this correction, the function should now handle different scenarios of indentation and correctly consume the prefix, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation.
