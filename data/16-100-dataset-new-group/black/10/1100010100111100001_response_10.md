The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing the test case test_comment_indentation in the test_black module to fail. The failing test is reporting an AssertionError, indicating that the function did not return the expected output.

Analyzing the runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy function reveals a potential error in the logic for consuming the prefix. In particular, the wait_for_nl flag seems to be set incorrectly in some cases, leading to unexpected behavior when consuming the lines. 

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the wait_for_nl flag and consuming the prefix needs to be modified. One approach could be to update the logic of the for loop condition and the if-else conditions for each character in the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if wait_for_nl and char not in [' ', '\t', '\n']:
                wait_for_nl = False
            if char in [' ', '\t', '\n']:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of the wait_for_nl flag being set incorrectly and updates the logic for consuming the prefix. With these changes, the _partially_consume_prefix function should now pass the failing test.
