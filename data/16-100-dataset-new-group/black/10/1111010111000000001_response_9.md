The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has several potential error locations. The function is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, but it contains conditional logic that may not correctly handle tab characters and newlines.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle tab characters (`\t`) correctly when calculating the current column position. This results in incorrect indentation tracking, leading to the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling tab characters and adjusting the column position based on these characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_line += ' ' * spaces
                current_column += spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1

            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the failing test case should pass as the indentation and prefix handling should now be properly managed.
