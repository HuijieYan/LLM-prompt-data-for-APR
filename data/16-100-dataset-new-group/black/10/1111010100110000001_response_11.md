The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is failing when using the `fs(contents_tab)` method, as it is not correctly updating the indentation levels with tabs. This is causing the failing test as it is not producing the expected result for the indentation.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions for checking characters within the prefix. Specifically, the conditions for handling tab indentation seem to be causing the issue.

The cause of the bug is that when a tab character is encountered, the function is incorrectly adding 4 to the `current_column` count, instead of updating it based on the number of spaces to maintain correct indentation levels.

To fix the bug, the strategy should involve updating the logic for handling tab characters in order to correctly maintain the indentation level without hard-coding the number of spaces to be added.

A corrected version of the function would be as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += next_tab_stop
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling tab characters has been updated to accurately calculate the number of spaces to be added to maintain the correct indentation level. This should now pass the failing test.
