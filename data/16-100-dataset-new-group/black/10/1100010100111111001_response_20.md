The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the failing test due to incorrect handling of indentation, resulting in unexpected output. The function is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables based on the input `prefix` and `column` values. Additionally, the logic for checking and consuming the prefix is flawed, leading to incorrect output.

I would suggest fixing the bug by updating the logic for handling indentation and consuming the prefix. This can be achieved by properly tracking the index of the current character in the prefix and updating the `current_line` and `current_column` variables accordingly. Additionally, the condition for consuming the prefix needs to be revised to ensure correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    index = 0  # track index of current character in prefix
    while index < len(prefix):
        char = prefix[index]
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        index += 1  # move to the next character in prefix
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the logic flaws and should now produce the expected output for the failing tests.
