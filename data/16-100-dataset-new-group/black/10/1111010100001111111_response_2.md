The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not correctly handle the indentation of comments when using tabs instead of spaces. This leads to an incorrect reformatting of the code when using the Black library.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation of comments with tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip('\t').strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the indentation of comments should be handled correctly, and the issue reported on GitHub related to the incorrect reformatting of code using tabs should be resolved.
