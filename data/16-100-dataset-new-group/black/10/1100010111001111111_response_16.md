The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string and return the consumed portion along with the remaining portion. Based on the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. The function incorrectly handles the indentation of comments containing spaces and tabs, leading to incorrect output and failing test cases.

The function incorrectly processes the input prefix string, leading to incorrect indentation handling for the comments. It fails to update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables correctly, resulting in the incorrect processing of the input prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation when encountering spaces, tabs, and newline characters in the input prefix. By properly updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables, we can ensure that the function processes the input prefix correctly and returns the expected consumed and remaining portions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have added a condition to properly handle the tab character (`\t`) to ensure that it increments the `current_column` by a consistent amount. Additionally, we have updated the handling of the newline character (`\n`) to properly reset the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables.

With these corrections, the function should now correctly consume the prefix and handle the indentation of comments, passing the failing test case and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
