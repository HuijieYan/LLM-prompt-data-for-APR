It looks like the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume and return part of a prefix string based on a given column value. However, it seems to have some issues with correctly tracking the current position and handling whitespace characters.

Upon analyzing the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, we can see that the function is failing to correctly handle the indentation of comments in the code. The function is expected to correctly consume the spaces or tabs before a comment and return the remaining prefix.

The potential error locations in the function are the handling of indentation and tracking the current column and line.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `current_line` values when processing the prefix string, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to properly handle the indentation and update the column and line information as we iterate through the prefix string.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                continue
        current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
