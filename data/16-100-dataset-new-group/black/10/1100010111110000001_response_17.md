The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume characters until a given column position is reached and return the consumed characters and the remaining characters as a pair of strings.

The potential error location in the function could be related to the logic of handling indentation and line breaks.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is trying to compare two strings `contents_tab` and `contents_spc` after formatting. The error message indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output, with a specific difference related to the comment indentation.

The bug is caused by the way the function handles indentation and line breaks, which resulted in incorrect formatting of the comments in the string.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles indentation and line breaks when consuming characters. Specifically, the function should correctly handle spaces, tabs, and newlines to maintain the correct indentation and formatting of the string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width as 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add the current line
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the updated logic to handle newlines and indentation, the corrected function should now properly consume characters and maintain the correct formatting of the input string, allowing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to pass successfully.
