The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix based on certain conditions and return the consumed prefix and the remaining one. The issue in the GitHub report is related to incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is a part of the `test_black.py` file and checks for correct indentation of comments.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions for indentation with spaces and tabs, handling of new lines, and tracking the column count.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and new lines when consuming the prefix. This results in incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly track the indentation level, handle tabulated comments after a dedent, and ensure consistent behavior for different indentation styles.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    lines.append(current_line)
    consumed_prefix = ''.join(lines)
    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(consumed_prefix):]
    return consumed_prefix, remaining_prefix
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should now handle the indentation and new lines correctly and pass the failing test related to comment indentation. This fix also addresses the reported issue on GitHub related to incorrect behavior with tabulated comments after a dedent.
