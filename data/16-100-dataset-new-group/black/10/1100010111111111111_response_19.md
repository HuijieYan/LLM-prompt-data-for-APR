To fix the buggy function, we need to address the logic for handling the indentation and newlines. It seems that the current logic does not correctly handle the indentation after a dedent, especially when dealing with tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the indentation when the input file uses tabs. It incorrectly changes the indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation and newlines, especially when tabs are involved.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.expandtabs().strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have modified the handling of tabs by using the `expandtabs()` method to replace tabs with spaces, ensuring consistent indentation calculation. We have also adjusted the logic of updating the `current_column` when encountering a tab character.

With these changes, the function should now properly handle the indentation and newlines, resolving the issue posted on GitHub and passing the failing test cases.
