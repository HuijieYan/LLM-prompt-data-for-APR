The bug in the given function is caused by the incorrect logic for handling indentation in the prefix string, resulting in the incorrect output and failing tests.

The issue occurs when the function encounters whitespace (space or tab) and incorrectly increments the current column. As a result, the indentation level is not correctly evaluated for comparison with the specified column, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation in the prefix string should be revised to accurately count the columns and compare them with the specified column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After correcting the function, it should be able to pass the failing test and handle indentation as expected, resolving the bug.
