The buggy function '_partially_consume_prefix' has a bug that causes incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. The function is not handling the tab character ('\t') correctly, resulting in incorrect indentation. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions for '\t' and 'wait_for_nl' checks. These conditions are not implemented correctly and are causing the bug.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the tab character ('\t') and is not accurately keeping track of the current column for indentation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately handle the tab character ('\t') by incrementing the 'current_column' by 4 for each tab. Additionally, the 'wait_for_nl' condition needs to be modified to ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ''
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ''
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust the column for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl when a newline is encountered
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version, the function should now handle the tab character and maintain the correct indentation level, which will resolve the issue posted on GitHub and address the failing test.
