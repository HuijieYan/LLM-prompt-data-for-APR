The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` causes the incorrect handling of indentation within the prefix, leading to incorrect output. The function is designed to process a Python code prefix, taking into account the given column for indentation. However, it fails to correctly account for tabs and spaces, leading to an incorrect result.

The function should correctly categorize each character in the prefix as whitespace, tab, newline, or other characters. If a newline is encountered, it should reset the current column and store the line if it's non-empty and the column is less than the given column. If a non-whitespace character is encountered after indentation is finished, it should wait for a newline.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle tab indentations, spaces, and newlines.

A corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column and store the line if applicable
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indent is finished, wait for newline
            current_line += char
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now correctly handle differences in indentation due to spaces and tabs, as well as process newlines and non-whitespace characters appropriately.

With these changes, the function should be able to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
