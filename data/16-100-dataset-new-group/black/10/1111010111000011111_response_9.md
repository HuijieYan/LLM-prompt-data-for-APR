To fix the bug, we need to address the issue where comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent. This issue is likely caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handling the indentation of comments. The function should correctly handle the indentation of comments, especially when transitioning from tabs to spaces.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic for processing tabs and spaces within the function. Specifically, we need to ensure that comments are properly aligned based on the indentation level of the code.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have added logic to handle newline characters and adjusted the indentation calculation when processing tabs. This should ensure that comments are correctly aligned after dedents, and it should resolve the issue where the indentation for comments is changed incorrectly.

This corrected version should successfully pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It should also resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
