The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the failing tests. The function is supposed to consume a given prefix string up to a specified column. It accumulates the consumed lines in the `lines` list until it reaches the specified column and then returns the consumed portion and the remaining prefix. However, there are issues with the logic when handling spaces and tabs.

In some cases, the function does not handle the tab characters correctly, leading to incorrect indentation tracking. This causes the function to return unexpected results and fail the test.

To fix the bug, the function should keep track of the number of spaces and tabs encountered instead of adding them directly to the `current_column`. It should also properly handle cases where the prefix string ends without encountering the specified column.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_spaces = 0
        current_tabs = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_spaces + 4*current_tabs < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_spaces = 0
                    current_tabs = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_spaces += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_tabs += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_spaces = 0
                current_tabs = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version tracks the number of spaces and tabs separately, allowing for more accurate indentation tracking. It also properly handles cases where the prefix string ends without encountering the specified column.

With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should pass the failing tests and behave as expected.
