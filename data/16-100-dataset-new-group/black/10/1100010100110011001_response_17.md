Based on the provided error message and the expected input/output values, the issue with the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely related to the handling of whitespace and newlines within the input `prefix`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation before the comment. As a result, when the input prefix consists of multiple lines with varying levels of indentation and a comment at the end, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix and return the expected result.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the cases where there are spaces, tabs, or newlines in the input prefix.

Here is a possible correction for the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By following this correction, the function should now correctly consume the input prefix and return the expected result in all test cases.
