The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` causes the function to return incorrect results when consuming the prefix string. This affects the indentation and commenting in the code. The main issue appears to be with the handling of whitespace and newline characters.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the logic for consuming the prefix string to correctly track the lines and columns.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
