To fix the buggy function, we need to address the incorrect handling of the indentation for comments. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the indentation for comments is changed incorrectly after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are handling of tabs, spaces, and new lines, as well as the incorrect implementation of wait_for_nl.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments, resulting in incorrect formatting of the code.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling tabs, spaces, and new lines, as well as the handling of wait_for_nl. The function should correctly maintain the indentation for comments and ensure that they are aligned with the next line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is equal to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for comments and align them with the next line, as expected in the failing test case and the GitHub issue report.
