The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing the function to not handle the whitespace correctly, leading to errors in the formatted string. The function is meant to track the current line, column, and indentation, and return the remaining prefix. However, it fails to properly handle the indentation and newlines, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the start of a new line, updates the current line and column accordingly, and returns the remaining prefix as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            
            if current_column < column:
                continue
            else:
                remaining = prefix[prefix.index(char) + 1:]
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, remaining
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should handle the indentation and newlines properly, and return the remaining prefix as expected.
