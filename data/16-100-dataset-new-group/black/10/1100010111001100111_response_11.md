The issue with the buggy function is that it fails to handle the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume the prefix of a string up to a certain column, handling different types of whitespace characters and newline characters. However, it does not handle the indentation for comments correctly after a dedent.

The cause of the bug can be identified from the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`. When analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables inside the buggy function, it is clear that the function is not handling the indentation for comments correctly. In particular, the `wait_for_nl` logic and the handling of spaces and tabs are not correctly updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the indentation and comments after a dedent needs to be updated. Specifically, the `wait_for_nl` condition needs to be revised to check for comments and adjust the `current_column` accordingly. Additionally, the handling of spaces and tabs needs to correctly update the `current_column` and `current_line` variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' and not in_comment:
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t' and not in_comment:
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            in_comment = False  # reset comment flag for new line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to handle comments and their relative indentation after a dedent, this corrected function should pass the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
