The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it is not correctly updating the `current_column` and the `lines` list when a new line character is encountered. As a result, the function is not producing the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the cases when a newline character is encountered and update the `current_column` and `lines` list accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, current_line
```

This corrected version handles the cases when a newline character in the prefix is encountered and updates the `current_column` and `lines` list accordingly.
