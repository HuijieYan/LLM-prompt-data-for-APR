## Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. The function fails to handle tab characters correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments. The function incorrectly updates the current_column value when encountering tab characters, leading to unexpected indentation.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab characters and update the indentation based on the tab width.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Assuming a tab width of 4 spaces, change this according to the actual tab width in the codebase
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces = tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces
            current_column += spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function will correctly handle tab characters and update the current_column and current_line variables based on the tab width. This should resolve the issue with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
