The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class has an issue that causes it to fail the `test_comment_indentation` test. The problem lies in the logic for handling indentation levels and waiting for line breaks.

The function fails to properly handle waiting for a new line character after encountering spaces or tabs. This causes the function to incorrectly calculate the current column and fails to consume the prefix as intended.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and new line characters within the `for` loop. Additionally, we need to adjust the condition for checking indentation completion.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the `test_comment_indentation` test.
