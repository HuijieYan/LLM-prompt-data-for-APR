The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the case properly where a new line character is encountered while waiting for a new line in the `prefix`. This is causing the function to misbehave and return incorrect values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for correctly handling new line characters in the `prefix`. We can modify the `elif char == '\n'` condition to reset the `current_column` and `current_line`, and also add the `current_line` to `lines` if the `current_line` is not empty.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
With this correction, the function should now correctly handle new line characters and return the expected values for the failing tests.
