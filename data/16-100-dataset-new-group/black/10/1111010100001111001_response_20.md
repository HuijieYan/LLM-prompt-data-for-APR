The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error that causes it to fail to correctly consume the prefix according to the given column and return the remaining prefix. Specifically, the logic for handling whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and newlines is causing the function to not behave as intended.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the logic for updating `current_column` and `current_line`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling whitespace characters and newlines, keep track of the current column correctly, and maintain the current line while waiting for a newline.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the given column and return the remaining prefix for all the provided test cases.
