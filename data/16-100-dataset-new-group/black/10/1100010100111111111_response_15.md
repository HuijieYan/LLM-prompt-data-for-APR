To fix the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`, we need to address the issue with the incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent. The bug causes an incorrect indentation of comments when the input file uses tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment after a dedent. This results in the incorrect behavior of the function, leading to the failing test and the reported GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function ensures that the indentation is properly handled, especially when encountering comments after a dedent. This should resolve the reported GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
