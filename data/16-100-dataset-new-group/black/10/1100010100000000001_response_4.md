The buggy function is supposed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column position and return the consumed part and the remaining part. However, there are a few potential error locations within the function that could be causing the bug:
1. The condition for checking if the current column is less than the specified column position may not be working correctly.
2. The logic for appending the current line to the lines list when encountering a new line character may not be correct.

The cause of the bug could be that the condition for checking the column position and handling the new line characters is not working as intended.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for checking the column position and appending the current line to the lines list when encountering a new line character.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Modified condition to include equal to
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:  # Modified condition to include equal to
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
