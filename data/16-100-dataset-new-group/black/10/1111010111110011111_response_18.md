The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a given prefix up to a certain column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, the function is not handling the tabulation and indentation correctly, leading to incorrect output.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The calculation of `current_column` is not correctly accounting for tabs.
2. The handling of indentation and encountering a new line character is not accurate, leading to incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is failing to correctly handle tabulation and indentation, resulting in the incorrect consumed prefix and remaining prefix.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle tabulation and indentation. This can be achieved by properly accounting for tabs in the calculation of `current_column` and adjusting the logic for handling indentation and encountering a new line character.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # account for tabulation
        else:
            current_column += 1
        
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should handle tabulation and indentation correctly, ensuring that the consumed prefix and remaining prefix are returned accurately. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
