The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the appending of `current_line` to `lines`. When `wait_for_nl` is True, the function should check if `current_column < column` and then append `current_line` to `lines`, but it always appends `current_line` to `lines` within the if block. This results in incorrect output because the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is not evaluated.

To fix the bug, the check for `current_column < column` should be moved outside of the `wait_for_nl` block, and the `current_line` should be appended to `lines` within the `wait_for_nl` block only if the condition is met.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the wait for newline and correctly append current_line to lines only when the condition is met, resulting in the correct output for the given input parameters.
