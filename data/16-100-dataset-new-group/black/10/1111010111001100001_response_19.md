The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the indentation of comment lines in the input string. This can be seen in the failing test `test_comment_indentation`. The buggy function fails to properly consume the prefix and increment the current column value when encountering spaces and tabs, resulting in incorrect indentation.

The critical issue is that the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being properly reset after processing a newline character, causing the function to incorrectly wait for a newline character when it should not.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic for handling newlines and reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when a newline is encountered. We also need to ensure that the `current_column` is incremented correctly according to the specified rules for spaces and tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comment lines and pass the failing tests.
