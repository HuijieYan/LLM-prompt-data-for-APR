The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The function is incorrectly handling the indentation when encountering a comment after a dedent, resulting in incorrect output for code with tab indentation.

The bug seems to be related to the `wait_for_nl` and the logic for handling different types of characters. When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function does not correctly adjust the indentation level for the comment.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling comments and indentation levels after a dedent. We also need to ensure that the correct indentation is maintained for the comment.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles indentation for comments after a dedent, fixing the issue reported on GitHub.
