The issue seems to be with the logic for handling the indentation levels and waiting for a new line character. The buggy function is not correctly handling the whitespace and indentation levels, which results in incorrect splitting of the prefix. 

The main issue is the `wait_for_nl` flag not being properly reset, and the conditional checks for whitespace and new line characters are incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling whitespace and new line characters, and properly reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function should now properly handle the whitespace and new line characters, and reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when necessary. This should fix the issue with incorrect splitting of the prefix and make the failing test pass.
