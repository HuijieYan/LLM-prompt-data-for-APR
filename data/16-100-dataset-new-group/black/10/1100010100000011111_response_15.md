The bug in the provided function seems to be related to handling the indentation of comments after dedent. The function is supposed to partially consume the prefix string until a specific column value and return the consumed portion along with the remaining prefix. However, the function does not handle the indentation of comments correctly, which is causing the issue reported on GitHub.

The potential error location in the function is the 'wait_for_nl' condition and the handling of tabs and spaces.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after dedent. It fails to maintain the correct indentation level of the comments, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to properly track the indentation level and handle tabs and spaces accurately while iterating through the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 8) // 8 * 8  # update current column based on tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function properly handles the indentation level, tab width, and waits for a new line. It ensures that the comments are correctly aligned based on the specified column value, resolving the reported issue on GitHub.
