The issue is related to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for this behavior. It fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments when the input file uses tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly account for the indentation level when encountering tab characters. This leads to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are involved.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to accurately track the indentation level, particularly when encountering tab characters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':  # Adjust for tabs
            current_column += 1
            current_column = current_column % 4  # Convert spaces to equivalent tabs
        elif char == '\t':
                # Adjust the current column for tabs
                current_column = (current_column + 4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly adjusts the `current_column` value when encountering tab characters. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
