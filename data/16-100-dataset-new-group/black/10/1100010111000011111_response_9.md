To fix the bug, we need to address the issue where the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. This issue occurs when the input file uses tabs.

Looking at the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, it compares the formatting of code using tabs and spaces, indicating that the bug is related to the indentations.

The cause of the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not handle tab characters correctly when calculating the current column. This leads to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tab characters and calculates the current column accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = current_column + 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column = next_tab_stop
            current_line += ' ' * (next_tab_stop - current_column)
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles tab characters by calculating the next tab stop and adjusting the current column accordingly. It also properly handles the calculation of the current column for spaces and newline characters.

This should resolve the issue of incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.
