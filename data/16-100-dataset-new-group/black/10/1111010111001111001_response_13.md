The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` and it's a part of the `Driver` class. The failing test is `test_comment_indentation` from the `test_black.py` file. 

The function takes `prefix` (a string) and `column` (an integer) as input, and it processes the `prefix` string to identify lines prior to the given column. The issue seems to be related to handling indentation and newline characters.

Upon analyzing the runtime and expected values, it appears that the function is not correctly processing the `prefix` string to identify lines based on the given column value. The issue is tied to the logic for identifying the lines.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to revamp the logic for identifying the lines based on the given column value. This could involve closely tracking the column length for each line and handling the indentation and newline characters more accurately.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issues with the original function and should pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output values.
