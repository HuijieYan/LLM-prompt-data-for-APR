To fix the identified bug in the function \_partially_consume_prefix, it is necessary to make some changes in the logic of the function. The variable `wait_for_nl` needs to be updated correctly whenever a new line is encountered. Currently, the function is not correctly handling the indentation logic, leading to incorrect results.

The loop logic needs to be modified to properly handle the indentation and line decisions. The condition for `wait_for_nl` should be updated according to the indentation and if a new line is encountered.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
