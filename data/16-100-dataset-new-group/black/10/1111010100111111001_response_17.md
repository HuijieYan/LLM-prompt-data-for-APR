The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly account for the indentation of the comment when determining the line and column. This leads to incorrect output when partially consuming the prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the indentation levels of the comment and correctly calculate the line and column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust based on the number of spaces each tab represents
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add current_line to lines
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we adjust the `current_column` based on the number of spaces each tab represents, and we ensure that `current_line` is added to `lines` when encountering a newline character.

This should address the indentation issue and ensure that the function returns the correct output.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
