The bug is in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function of the `Driver` class. This function is supposed to consume a prefix up to a certain column, but it does not handle the indentation properly, leading to incorrect consumption of the prefix.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the indentation levels, which results in incorrect prefix consumption and ultimately leads to a failed test.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly account for the indentation levels and handle the characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column, accounting for the indentation levels, and passing the failing test.
