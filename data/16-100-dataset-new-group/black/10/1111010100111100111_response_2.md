## Corrected Version

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        tab_width = 4  # set tab width to 4
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += tab_width  # increment current_column by tab_width
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation:
The bug in the original function is caused by incorrect handling of tab characters for indentation. The function does not account for the correct increase in the `current_column` when encountering tab characters, causing it to incorrectly calculate the indentation.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function introduces a new variable `tab_width` to represent the width of a tab character, and updates the `current_column` by adding the `tab_width` when encountering a tab character.

This fix addresses the root cause of the bug by ensuring that the function correctly handles tab characters and calculates the indentation based on the specified tab width.

After implementing the fix, the failing test cases should now pass.
