The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect handling of the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The bug is related to the issue reported on GitHub titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions for checking the indentation level and the handling of tabs and spaces.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect identification of tabs and spaces, resulting in a misinterpretation of the code's indentation level. This causes the function to incorrectly handle tabulated comments after a dedent.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the function accurately identifies tabs and spaces and correctly calculates the indentation level. Additionally, the function should handle tabulated comments after a dedent without changing their indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I fixed the handling of tabs and spaces to accurately calculate the indentation level. I also modified the condition for checking the presence of characters in the line to correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent.
