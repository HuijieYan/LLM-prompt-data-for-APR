The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation of comments correctly. It is causing the indentation for comments to be changed incorrectly after a dedent.

The specific error messages related to the failing test indicate that the indentation for comments is not being handled properly, causing it to be reformatted incorrectly.

Upon analyzing the runtime input/output variable values, it is clear that the function is not correctly identifying and preserving the indentation of comments when handling different cases.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments. It should properly identify and preserve the indentation of comments based on the input prefix and column values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    # check if the current_line has more whitespace than the given column
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should preserve the indentation of comments correctly, and it should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.
