The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a few issues with handling newline characters and indentations. The main issue seems to be the incorrect indentation tracking due to spaces and tabs not being properly handled.

To fix this, we need to accurately track the current column position based on spaces and tabs encountered in the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function

class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values for the buggy function's test cases.
