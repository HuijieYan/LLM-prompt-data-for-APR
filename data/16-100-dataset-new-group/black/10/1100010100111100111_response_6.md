## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to partially consume a prefix string while keeping track of the current line and column. However, the function fails to handle the indentation for comments after a dedent properly, as reported in the GitHub issue. It seems that the function is not properly handling the indentation when it encounters a comment.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation and waiting for a new line when encountering a comment after a dedent. This results in incorrect behavior when consuming the prefix string, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it's necessary to carefully handle the indentation for comments after a dedent and ensure that the waiting for a new line is properly managed. Additionally, the logic for consuming the prefix string needs to be reviewed to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:  # added condition
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == '#':  # handle comment indentation
                while current_column < column:
                    current_line += ' '
                    current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly handles the indentation for comments after a dedent and ensures that waiting for a new line is correctly managed. Additionally, the logic for consuming the prefix string is reviewed and adjusted to prevent incorrect formatting. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
