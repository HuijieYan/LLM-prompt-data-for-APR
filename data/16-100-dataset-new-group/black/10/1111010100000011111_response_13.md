The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent. It seems to have issues with tracking the current column and handling tab characters.

The main potential error locations in the function are:
1. Incorrectly updating the `current_column` when encountering a tab character.
2. Incorrectly checking for the end of the indent block when encountering characters other than space, tab, or newline.
3. Inconsistent handling of `wait_for_nl` flag.

The cause of the bug is due to the function not accurately tracking the current column position when encountering tab characters, and not correctly waiting for a newline character to determine the end of the indent block. This leads to incorrect indentation and the reported issue with comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the column position while handling tab characters and properly wait for a newline character to determine the end of the indent block.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function accurately handles tab characters to update the current column position correctly and waits for a newline character to determine the end of the indent block. This should resolve the reported issue with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
