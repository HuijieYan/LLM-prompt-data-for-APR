The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to accept a prefix and a column as input, and then parse the prefix string to partially consume it based on the provided column. The bug seems to be that when encountering a comment after a dedent, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation.

The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` checks whether the `assertFormatEqual` call correctly formats the input using spaces and tabs. The error message indicates that the actual and expected outputs do not match for the `contents_tab` input.

The provided GitHub issue describes a similar problem with incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, specifically when using tabs. This matches the behavior observed in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to correctly handle indentation when encountering a comment after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False # Change this line to reset wait_for_nl
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if char != '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we reset `wait_for_nl` to `False` when encountering a new line, and only set it to `True` when an indent is finished and the character is not a comment symbol '#'.

This fix should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles indentation, specifically for comments after a dedent when using tabs.
