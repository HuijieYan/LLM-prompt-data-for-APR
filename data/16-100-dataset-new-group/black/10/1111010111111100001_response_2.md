The cause of the bug in the "_partially_consume_prefix" function is due to the incorrect handling of indentation and comment lines in the input prefix. The current logic is not able to accurately consume the prefix to the expected result, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic for consuming the prefix needs to be restructured to accurately handle indentation and comment lines. The function should correctly process each character in the prefix and update the line and column conditions accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now accurately handle the indentation and comment lines in the prefix, leading to the passing of the failing test cases.
