The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing the indentation issue for comments after a dedent. This function is supposed to partially consume a given prefix string based on the given column value. However, there are issues with handling tab characters and handling the indentation of comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle tab characters and does not adjust the indentation of comments when there is a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the function to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the indentation of comments after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for i, char in enumerate(prefix):
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line + prefix[i+1:])
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[i+1:]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False
            if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles tab characters properly and adjusts the indentation of comments after a dedent.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values as well as resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
