The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix() is designed to process a prefix string and return a substring that consists of lines that have a certain indentation level. The function has several potential error locations, including the handling of indentation level and the identification of lines based on the provided column.

The cause of the bug in the function is that it does not properly handle the indentation level when constructing the current_line and processing the wait_for_nl variable. This results in the function failing to correctly split the prefix string based on the specified column.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the current indentation level for each line and correctly identify when a new line should be started based on the provided column.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                if current_column >= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
    
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version of the function, we have added a condition to correctly handle the wait_for_nl variable and the indentation level to properly construct the lines based on the specified column.
