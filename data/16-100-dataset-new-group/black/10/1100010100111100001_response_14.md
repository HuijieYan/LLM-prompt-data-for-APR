The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix until a certain column number, and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, the function does not handle comments correctly, leading to the failing test.

The issue arises from the way the function handles waiting for a new line (`\n`) character. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly reset after consuming the new line character within a comment.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is correctly reset when encountering a new line character within a comment.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset wait_for_nl flag within comments
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle comments and reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a new line character within a comment. This should resolve the failing test.
