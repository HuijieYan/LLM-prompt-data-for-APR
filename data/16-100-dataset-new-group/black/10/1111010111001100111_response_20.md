The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. The function appears to have a bug related to handling indentation and newlines, resulting in incorrect behavior when processing tabulated comments after a dedent. This issue is reflected in the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the condition for checking if the current line should be added to the `lines` list.

The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect handling of indentation and newlines within the `wait_for_nl` conditional block. When a newline is encountered, the function should check whether the current line needs to be added to the `lines` list based on the column value. However, the current implementation does not handle this logic correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we should revise the logic for handling indentation and newlines and ensure that the correct line is added to the `lines` list when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
- We removed the `wait_for_nl` logic as it was causing the incorrect behavior. Instead, we directly check whether the current line needs to be added to the `lines` list when encountering a newline.
- The if condition for adding the current line to the `lines` list is modified to correctly capture the indentation level and ensure the correct behavior.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to tabulated comments and incorrect indentation after a dedent.
