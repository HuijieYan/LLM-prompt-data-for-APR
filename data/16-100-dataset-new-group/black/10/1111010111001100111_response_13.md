The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to handling the indentation level for comments after a dedent. The function is not correctly tracking the column position and is not properly handling the indentation of comments.

The potential error locations within the function could be the logic for tracking the column position, handling different types of whitespace (spaces and tabs), and identifying the start of a new line for the comment.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect tracking of the column position and the handling of different types of whitespace characters. This leads to incorrect indentation for the comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, it is important to accurately track the column position, handle both spaces and tabs for indentation, and correctly identify the start of a new line for the comment.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming tab size is 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version effectively handles both spaces and tabs for indentation, tracks the column position accurately, and correctly identifies the start of a new line for the comment.

This should address the indentation issue and resolve the problem mentioned in the GitHub issue.
