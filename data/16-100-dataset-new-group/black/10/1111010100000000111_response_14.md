Potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error in the buggy function is in the logic that calculates the current indentation level and handles tabulated comments after a dedent. It seems that the logic for tracking the current_column and wait_for_nl flags is not correctly handling tabulated comments after a dedent.

Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function is not correctly handling tabulated comments after a dedent, which causes incorrect changes in the indentation for comments past depth 0 after a dedent.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling tabulated comments after a dedent. The function should correctly calculate the current indentation level and handle tabulated comments in a way that preserves the original formatting.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate the spaces to add for the tab
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the logic for handling tabulated comments by ensuring that the current_column is correctly updated when encountering tabs. This should address the issue of incorrectly changed indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
