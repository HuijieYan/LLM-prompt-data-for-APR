The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method in the `Driver` class that is meant to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. It iterates through each character in the prefix string, updating the `current_line` and `current_column` variables as it goes.

The potential error in the function occurs when it encounters a newline character (`\n`). If the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True`, it should handle the new line appropriately, but there are issues with the logic and tracking of `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline.

The cause of the bug is that when the function encounters a comment at the same level of indentation, it does not correctly handle the newline character, which results in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly tracks the current line and column, especially when encountering a newline character and a comment at the same level of indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle new lines and comments at the same level of indentation, passing the failing test.
