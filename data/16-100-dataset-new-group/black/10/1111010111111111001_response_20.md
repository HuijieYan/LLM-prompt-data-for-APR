#### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to consume a portion of a given text, taking into account the indentation level. However, the function currently has issues in correctly processing the input.

The error message comes from a failing test that checks the function's ability to properly format text by adjusting the indentation levels.

The function's behavior is dependent on a number of conditions and variables, such as `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`, and `char`.

The failing test is executed under different scenarios, testing the function's performance under varied input settings.

#### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the improper handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition, which is intended to track waiting for a new line. The conditions related to indentation are also incorrectly handling the `current_column` variable, leading to improper indentation handling. As a result, the function fails to correctly categorize and consume the input text.

#### Bug Fix Strategy
The function needs to be redesigned to handle indentation and new line conditions properly. Specifically, the `current_column` variable and the conditions regarding indentation need to be reassessed to ensure the correct adjustment of indentation levels. Also, the behavior of disambiguating the current line and waiting for new lines should be reviewed and corrected.

#### The Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
