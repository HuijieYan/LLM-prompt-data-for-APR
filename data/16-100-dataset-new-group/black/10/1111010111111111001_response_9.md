The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the indentation correctly, causing it to return incorrect results. The function is meant to consume a prefix up to a given column, but it fails to do so when encountering whitespace and newline characters.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling whitespace and newline characters in order to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        lines.append(current_line)
        
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output for different input values.
