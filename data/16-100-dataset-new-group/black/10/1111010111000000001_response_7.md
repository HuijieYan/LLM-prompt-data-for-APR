The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with the way it handles indentation and new lines, which is causing it to fail the test `test_comment_indentation` in the `test_black.py` file.

The buggy function does not handle the indentation properly, resulting in incorrect behavior when processing the input string. It fails to correctly identify and handle the spaces, tabs, and new lines, and as a result, it produces incorrect output for the given input.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation, spaces, tabs, and new lines in the input prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += ' '
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += '\t'
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the bug in the original function and ensure that it processes the input prefix correctly by handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and new lines according to the expected behavior.
