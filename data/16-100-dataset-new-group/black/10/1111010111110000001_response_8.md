The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to handle indentation in Python code, but it is causing an error in one of the test cases `test_comment_indentation`. The error message indicates that the function is not handling indentation properly, resulting in a failing test.

The potential error locations within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function are the logic for handling space, tab, newline, and indent characters.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not accurately compute the indentation level and fails to consume the prefix accordingly. This results in incorrect comparisons of the formatted contents, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation by tracking the spaces, tabs, and newlines in the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle the indentation in the `prefix`, and the failing test should pass.
