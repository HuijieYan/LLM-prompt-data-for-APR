## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` may not accurately determine if the current line needs to be consumed. 
2. The logic for handling the indentation and whitespace characters may not be correctly updating the current_column count.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug causes incorrect handling of the comments' indentation after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs instead of spaces. This results in incorrect reformatting of the comments in the output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition to correctly check if the current line needs to be consumed based on the column count.
2. Adjust the logic for handling whitespace characters to ensure that the current_column count is accurately updated.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.expandtabs().lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            # expected to handle newline character differently than other characters
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated code correctly handles the condition to consume the current line based on the column count and adjusts the logic for handling whitespace characters, including tabs. It should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
