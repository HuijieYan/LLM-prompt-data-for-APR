The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function seems to be related to the handling of indentation when processing comments after a dedent. The function appears to incorrectly increment the current_column value when encountering a tab character, which leads to incorrect indentation of comments.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling tab characters in the prefix string. We also need to adjust the current_column value based on the number of tab characters encountered.

Here's a corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate the number of spaces to reach the next tab stop
            current_line += ' ' * num_spaces  # Replace tab with spaces
            current_column += num_spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the tab character handling and adjusts the current_column value accordingly. It should now produce the expected output for the failing test cases.

Renewing the GitHub issue description with the fixed bug would involve providing the corrected function and demonstrating that it resolves the incorrect comment indentation issue that occurs after a dedent when using tabs in the input file.
