Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The logic for checking if a tab or space is encountered is not working correctly.
2. The logic for handling the indentation level is not accurate.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of tabulation in the input file. The function is not correctly identifying the tabs and spaces to maintain the correct indentation level, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic to accurately identify tabs and spaces to maintain the correct indentation level.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation level and does not change it incorrectly after a dedent.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_size = 4  # Assuming tab size is 4 spaces
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_size
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version of the function, the logic for handling tabs and spaces has been modified to accurately track the indentation level. Additionally, a tab_size variable has been added to handle tabs correctly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect tabulation for comments after a dedent.
