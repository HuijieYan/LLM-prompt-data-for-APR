## Analysis:
The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix takes a prefix and a column as input and attempts to partially consume the prefix up to the specified column. However, there are potential error locations within the function where the current_column and wait_for_nl variables may not be updated correctly, leading to incorrect results.

## Error Locations:
1. The current_column variable may not be updated correctly when processing tab characters ('\t').
2. The wait_for_nl flag may not be reset correctly after encountering a newline character ('\n').

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters tab characters or newline characters within the prefix. This causes the current_column and wait_for_nl variables to update incorrectly, leading to incorrect consumption of the prefix.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current_column and wait_for_nl variables are updated correctly when encountering tab and newline characters within the prefix. Additionally, we need to handle tab characters ('\t') by incrementing current_column by 4, and reset the wait_for_nl flag after encountering a newline character ('\n').

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
