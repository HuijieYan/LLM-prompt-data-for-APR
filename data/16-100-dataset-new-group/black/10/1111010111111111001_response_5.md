The bug is caused by incorrect behavior when encountering a new line character. Specifically, the `char == '\n'` condition doesn't correctly handle indentation when the column number is greater than 0.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic to correctly handle the identification of new lines and their impact on indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # Skip non-whitespace characters after indentation is finished
                if not char.isspace():
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated version includes an additional `else` condition to handle non-whitespace characters after the indentation is finished. This ensures that the `wait_for_nl` flag is set correctly, enabling the function to correctly handle indentation and new line characters.
