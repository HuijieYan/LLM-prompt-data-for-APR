The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be designed to process and partially consume input text based on a given prefix and column. The function shows logic for handling indentation and new lines, but there is an issue with the logic, causing the failing test. 

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is designed to check the formatting of the input contents, particularly focusing on the indentation of comments. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs do not match due to a misplaced comment within the input contents.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle comments and indentation properly as per the failing test's expectations. The function does not accurately handle and consume the prefix, leading to incorrect formatting of the input contents.

To fix the bug, the logic within `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to accurately handle comments and indentation. Additionally, the function needs to correctly consume the prefix and adjust the formatting of the input contents accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the updated implementation, the function should now accurately handle and consume the prefix based on the given column, resolving the bug and enabling the test to pass successfully.
