The issue in the buggy function is related to indentation handling and the incorrect consumption of prefix characters. This results in the incorrect handling of comments after a dedent, leading to a change in comment indentation.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the logic for handling indentation, waiting for new lines, and the addition of characters to the `lines` list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the indentation level and wait for new lines, causing incorrect consumption of prefix characters. This leads to the incorrect handling of comments after a dedent, resulting in the change in comment indentation. This aligns with the reported issue on GitHub where the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent is being incorrectly changed. The failing test demonstrates this by showing the expected and actual output strings, where the comment indentation is different.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation level and wait for new lines. It should also properly maintain the comment indentation after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and new line waiting, ensuring that the comment indentation is maintained after a dedent. This should address the reported issue on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
