The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix has an issue with correctly handling the indentation for comments, specifically when using tabs. It incorrectly changes the indentation for comments after a dedent, leading to the undesired behavior described in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the indentation level for tabulated comments after a dedent. It incorrectly calculates the current_column and does not account for tabs when calculating the indentation level.

To resolve this bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters and calculate the correct indentation level for comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function properly handles tab characters, adjusts the current_column based on the tab width, and calculates the correct indentation level for comments. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
