The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by incorrectly checking the current column value when encountering a newline character. The function does not correctly handle the indent before the comment and thus fails to return the expected result.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling the current column and wait_for_nl flag when encountering a newline character.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the updated logic for handling the current column and wait_for_nl flag, the function should now correctly handle the indent before the comment and return the expected result.
