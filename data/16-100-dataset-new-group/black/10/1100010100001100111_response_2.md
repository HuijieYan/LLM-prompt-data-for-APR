The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The function is not correctly considering the indentation level and is not preserving the original indentation for comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation level when dealing with comments after a dedent. It fails to accurately determine the correct column for the comment and does not preserve the original indentation level for comments.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately tracks the column and preserves the original indentation level for comments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            break

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By removing the `wait_for_nl` condition and breaking when encountering characters other than space, tab, or newline, the function now accurately handles the indentation levels and preserves the original indentation for comments.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.
