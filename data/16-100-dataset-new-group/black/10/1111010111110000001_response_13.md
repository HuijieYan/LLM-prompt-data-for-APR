The root cause of the bug is that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the indentation levels and comments in the code. This is causing the failing test to produce an AssertionError message because the expected and actual output are not matching due to incorrect handling of comments and indentation in the function.

Specifically, the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being set correctly when encountering comments and this is leading to incorrect handling of indentation levels and comments.

To fix this bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation levels and comments when consuming the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for i, char in enumerate(prefix):
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and comments, and the failing test should pass without producing the AssertionError message.
