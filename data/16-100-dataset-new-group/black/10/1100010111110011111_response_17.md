Based on the error message and the failing test, as well as the expected input/output values, it is clear that the bug is causing the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. This is leading to the test failing with the AssertionError due to incorrect indentation of the comment.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation levels and newlines in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is not correctly identifying when to wait for a newline and is not updating the current line and column appropriately.

To fix the bug, an improved strategy would involve ensuring that the function correctly handles the indentation levels, newlines, and waits for newline characters in a way that accurately represents the input. Additionally, the function should correctly calculate the indentation level when there are tab characters present.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By improving the handling of indentation levels and newline characters, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
