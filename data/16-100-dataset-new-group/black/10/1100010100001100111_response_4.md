The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column. However, it has a bug that causes incorrect handling of newline characters and indentation.

Based on the provided runtime values and types, as well as the GitHub issue, we can see that the function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent, specifically when using tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly updates the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when encountering a newline character or indentation. This results in incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

To fix the bug, I suggest refactoring the logic to correctly handle the indentation and newline characters, especially when dealing with tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # adjust based on tab width
            current_line += char
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    lines.append(current_line)  # handle the case when prefix ends without a newline
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

In this corrected version, the function accurately handles the indentation and newline characters, taking into account the use of tabs and ensuring that the comment indentation is preserved after a dedent, as per the GitHub issue.
