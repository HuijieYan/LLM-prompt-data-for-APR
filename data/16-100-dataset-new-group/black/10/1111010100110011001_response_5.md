# The cause of the bug
The partially_consume_prefix function is designed to partially consume a prefix string by processing it character by character until a certain column limit. However, it is not correctly handling the indentation of comments marked by the "#" symbol.

# Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to accurately track the column position when encountering a "#" character in the input prefix, as well as correctly build the lines based on the column positions and characters encountered.

# The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '#':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
