The bug in the given function is caused by incorrect handling of the indentation and newlines. The function is not properly identifying the current column and waiting for a new line before breaking the prefix. This causes the function to return incorrect values and fail the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should properly track the current column, check for newlines, and wait for a new line before breaking the prefix. Additionally, the logic for incrementing the current column should be based on the length of the spaces and tabs encountered, ensuring that the indentation is properly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                stripped_line = current_line.strip()
                if stripped_line and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming tabs are counted as 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly tracks the current column, waits for a new line before breaking the prefix, and handles both spaces and tabs to increment the current column.

This should resolve the issues and make the function return the correct values for the given test cases.
