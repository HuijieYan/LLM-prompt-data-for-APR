## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` seems to be incorrect and may not handle the indentation levels correctly.
2. The logic for handling tabs and spaces for indentation seems to be flawed, leading to incorrect results.

## Cause of the bug
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation levels and the logic for processing tabs and spaces is flawed. This results in incorrect formatting of the comments after a dedent.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the condition for checking the indentation level to ensure it is correctly handled.
2. Revise the logic for handling tabs and spaces to accurately determine the indentation levels.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Assume tab width is 4
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function takes into account the tab width and accurately calculates the indentation level for spaces and tabs. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
