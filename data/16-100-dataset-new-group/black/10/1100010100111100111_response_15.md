Based on the runtime values and types of variables provided and the GitHub issue description, it seems that the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

The buggy function incorrectly handles the indentation level for comments after a dedent. It fails to properly identify and adjust the column for comments, leading to incorrect output when reformatting the code.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the column for comments and adjusts the indentation level accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we've added an adjustment for the column when encountering a tab character to ensure that the indentation level is handled correctly.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing tests.
