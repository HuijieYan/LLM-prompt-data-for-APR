### Analysis:
The `buggy function` is `_partially_consume_prefix` found in the `Driver` class. The error message occurs when the indentation for comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent. The GitHub issue confirms that this is a problem with the library and occurs when the input file uses tabs.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of indentation levels.
2. Mismatch in the actual and expected output when using tabs for indentation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect reformatting of the code, causing the mismatch between the actual and expected output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.
2. Make sure the function handles tabs for indentation properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        indentation = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    indentation = 0  # Reset indentation after newline
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                indentation += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                indentation += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                indentation = 0  # Reset indentation after newline
            else:
                # Indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes proper handling of indentation and resets the indentation after a newline. This should address the indentation issue identified in the GitHub report.
