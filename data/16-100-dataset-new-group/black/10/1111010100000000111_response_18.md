Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The "partially_consume_prefix" function is responsible for processing the prefix of the input and splitting it based on the specified column. The bug may be related to the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces, leading to the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent. This can be achieved by properly tracking the column position and adjusting the indentation as needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_add
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

In this corrected version, the function now properly handles tabs and spaces, ensuring the correct indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
