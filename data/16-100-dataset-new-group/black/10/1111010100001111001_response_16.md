There's an issue with the logic in the _partially_consume_prefix function that causes it to not handle the prefix and column inputs correctly. The function doesn't properly track the current column position and doesn't handle the case where the prefix doesn't contain a newline character.


The following are the steps to fix the bug:

1. Update the logic for tracking the current column position based on the encountered characters.
2. Check for the case where the prefix doesn't contain a newline character and handle it accordingly.
3. Update the logic for waiting for a newline character to handle the indentation correctly.
4. Ensure that the function correctly returns the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.


Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
With these updates, the function should now correctly handle the prefix and column inputs and return the expected consumed and remaining prefix.
