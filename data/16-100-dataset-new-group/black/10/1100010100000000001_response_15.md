## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            continue  # Skip to the next iteration without executing the remaining code for the current iteration
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Analysis of the buggy function
The buggy function is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. It processes each character in the prefix string and tracks the current line and column position.

## Identified potential error locations
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the handling of newline characters. When encountering a newline character, the current column is reset to 0. However, it does not skip the remaining code for the current iteration, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

## Cause of the bug
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character, and the current column position is reset to 0, but the remaining code for the current iteration continues to execute. This can cause unexpected behavior when determining the consumed prefix.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should add a `continue` statement after resetting the current column to skip the remaining code for the current iteration when a newline character is encountered. This will prevent any unintended actions from being performed after resetting the column position.

By adding the `continue` statement, the function will correctly handle newline characters and avoid incorrect behavior.
