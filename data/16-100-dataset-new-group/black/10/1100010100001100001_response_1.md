The buggy function has an issue with the logic for checking the column value and handling newline characters. 

The main cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the newline character and updating the current line and column values. The function fails to properly update the current_line, lines, and current_column values when encountering newline characters.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling newline characters and properly update the current_line, lines, and current_column values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if column <= current_column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if column <= current_column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version includes the corrected logic for handling newline characters and updating the line and column values. It checks the column value correctly and updates the line and column values based on the encountered characters.
