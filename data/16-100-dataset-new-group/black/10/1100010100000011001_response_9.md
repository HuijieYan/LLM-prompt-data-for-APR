The bug in the function is that it incorrectly handles the calculation of the `current_column` and the `lines` list, which results in incorrect output for some cases.

The `wait_for_nl` flag should be set to `True` when a non-space character is encountered, indicating that the indent is finished and the function should wait for a newline character. Additionally, the `current_column` should be updated after appending a new line to the `lines` list.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the calculation of `current_column` and the `lines` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_column += 1  # always increase column count
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            continue  # skip counting for a space
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 3  # increase column count for tab
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
