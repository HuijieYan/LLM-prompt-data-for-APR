The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with handling whitespace and new lines, which is causing the failing test and the AssertionError in the error message.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the indentation before the comment correctly. When a '#' character is encountered, it is not properly checking the indentation level and is incorrectly consuming the following lines. This causes the incorrect output and the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation level before consuming the comment and returning the correct prefix. One way to fix this is to keep track of the current indentation level and compare it with the required column before consuming the comment.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset current_column
            current_column = 0
            if not wait_for_nl:
                current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if char == '#':
                if current_column == column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

After applying this fix, the function should now handle the indentation correctly when encountering a comment, and the failing test should pass without any errors.
