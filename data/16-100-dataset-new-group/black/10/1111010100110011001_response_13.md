    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif wait_for_nl:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The cause of the bug in the original function is that the condition `elif wait_for_nl:` is never actually triggered because it should be an `elif` statement. As a result, the logic for handling indentation is never reached, causing incorrect behavior in the function.

To fix the bug, the condition `elif wait_for_nl:` should be replaced with an `elif` statement within the existing `for` loop. 

The corrected version of the buggy function addresses this issue and should pass the failing test.
