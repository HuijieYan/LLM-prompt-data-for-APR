## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                # handle tab spaces as multiple of 4
                while current_column % 8 != 0:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the buggy function, we have made the following changes:

1. Added `current_line` to the `res` variable to include the current line in the output string.
2. Corrected the calculation of the `current_column` for tabs to handle them as multiples of 4, aligning with the proper indentation.

These changes address the issue of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

By making these corrections, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
