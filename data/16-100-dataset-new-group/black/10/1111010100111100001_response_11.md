The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to how indentation is being handled. The function attempts to consume a part of the input `prefix` string based on the `column` parameter, but the indentation logic is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that when the function reaches a newline character, it does not correctly reset the `current_line` and `current_column` variables, leading to incorrect consumption of the `prefix` string.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle newlines and reset the variables accordingly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct portion of the `prefix` string is returned after being consumed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly consume the `prefix` string based on the `column` parameter and return the correct consumed part and the remaining part of the `prefix` string. This should fix the failing test cases.
