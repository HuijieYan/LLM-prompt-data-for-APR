The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given prefix string based on a given column value. However, there are issues with the logic for identifying and handling indentation, especially with tab characters.

The bug causes incorrect consumption of the prefix, leading to incorrect indentation in the output, which fails the test `test_comment_indentation`. This is evident from the error message, indicating a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

Based on the analysis of runtime variable values and expected values, it's clear that the `wait_for_nl` condition and the handling of tab characters are causing the incorrect behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling tab characters and identifying the waiting state for a new line (indicated by `wait_for_nl`) needs to be revised.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with tab handling and indentation tracking, which caused the incorrect behavior. With these changes, the function should now produce the expected output, passing the failing test and resolving the issue on GitHub.
