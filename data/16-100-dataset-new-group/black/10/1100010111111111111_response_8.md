def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

I analyzed the buggy function and found that the `wait_for_nl` logic was causing incorrect behavior after a dedent. To fix the bug, I modified the condition for handling a newline character and the logic for appending `current_line` to `lines`. The corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
