The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not consuming the correct prefix in the given input string. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and waits for a newline character. This is causing a misalignment in the indentation of the output strings.

The bug is causing the test `test_comment_indentation` to fail. The failing test is directly related to the incorrect output of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, resulting in a misaligned string when comparing the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation and newlines in the input string to ensure that the prefix is consumed correctly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # only add non-empty lines
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""  # reset current_line for the next line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # reset wait_for_nl
            continue  # Move to the next character
        else:
            current_line += char  # accumulate characters for the current line
            wait_for_nl = True  # Set wait_for_nl
    if current_line.strip():  # add the last non-empty line
        lines.append(current_line)

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check for non-empty lines on encountering a newline character and reset the current line for the next line. Additionally, we removed the unexpected empty line condition and included logic to properly accumulate characters for the current line.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
