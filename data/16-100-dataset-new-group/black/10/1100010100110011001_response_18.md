The cause of the bug in the given function is that when a comment is reached, the logic for indent detection and removal does not handle it correctly. This causes the whitespace pattern to be improperly compared, leading to a failure in the test case for comment indentation.

To fix the bug, the logic for indent detection and removal should be modified to correctly handle comments, ensuring that the correct amount of whitespace is removed for the given indentation level.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    lines.append(current_line)
                elif current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
