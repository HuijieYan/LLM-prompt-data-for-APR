The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, but it has a bug that causes incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent. The `wait_for_nl` flag is used to track if the function is waiting for a new line after an indent, but it's not properly handling the case when encountering a tab character.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when encountering a tab character within the prefix string. This leads to incorrect indentation handling for tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function correctly handles tab characters as well as spaces when calculating the current column.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles tab characters and spaces when calculating the current column, ensuring that the indentation is handled correctly. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test cases.
