The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error that causes it to incorrectly calculate the remaining prefix string. The issue arises from the `wait_for_nl` flag when it is set to False after an indent is finished in a line, but it should be checking for whether `wait_for_nl` is True or False.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle cases where the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to False. It should also properly handle the situation where a space or tab character is encountered after the indent is finished.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
