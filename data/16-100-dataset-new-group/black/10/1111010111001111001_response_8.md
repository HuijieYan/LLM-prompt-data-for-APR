The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has several issues that are causing the failing test cases to fail. 

1. The condition `if char == ' ':` adds 1 to `current_column`, but it should add 4, which is the consequence of adding a space.

2. The condition `elif char == '\t':` adds 4 to `current_column`, which is correct.

3. The condition `elif char == '\n':` resets `current_column` to 0, which is correct.

4. The condition `else:` is incorrect because it is only triggered when `char` is neither a space, tab, nor newline. Instead, it should handle the case where the indentation is finished.

5. Inside the `if wait_for_nl:` block, the comparison `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is inefficient and the control flow is also incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the conditions and control flow to correctly handle the input parameters based on the expected values and types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should now pass, and the function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
