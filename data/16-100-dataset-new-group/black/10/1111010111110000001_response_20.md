The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to have an issue with processing indentation and new lines. The function seems to be trying to consume a prefix containing indentation and new lines and return the remaining unparsed portion along with the consumed portion.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is comparing two different strings and expecting them to be equal. The error message shows that the actual and expected strings are not matching due to an issue with comment indentation. This failure is likely due to the incorrect implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not properly handling indentation and new lines, especially in cases where there are comments with inconsistent indentation.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function and ensure it correctly consumes the prefix while handling indentation, new lines, and comments.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif wait_for_nl:
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have adjusted the logic to better handle the indentation, new lines, and comments. This should resolve the bug and make the `test_comment_indentation` test pass.
