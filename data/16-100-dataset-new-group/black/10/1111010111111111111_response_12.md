The cause of the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that the logic for handling indentation and waiting for a new line is incorrect, leading to incorrect handling of indentation and comments. The issue reported in GitHub also confirms that there is a problem with indentation being incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has the following potential error locations:
1. Incorrectly updating the `current_column` when encountering a `'\n'` character.
2. Incorrect logic for handling indentation and waiting for a new line, leading to incorrect handling of comments.

To fix the bug, the logic to handle indentation and waiting for a new line needs to be corrected. Additionally, the indentation logic should take into account whether tabs or spaces are being used for indentation. The function should also correctly handle the scenario when the input file uses tabs for indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Assuming tab width is 4
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // tab_width + 1) * tab_width
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, it should properly handle the indentation and waiting for a new line, and correctly process the input file whether it uses tabs or spaces for indentation. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test.
