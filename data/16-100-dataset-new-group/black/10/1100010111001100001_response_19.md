The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be incorrectly identifying the prefix to be partially consumed. This is causing the function to return incorrect values, leading to failing tests.

The buggy function incorrectly handles the wait_for_nl condition, leading to incorrect results when the prefix contains tabs and spaces. It also fails to handle the indentation level and column correctly. This causes the function to return the wrong prefix and leftover string.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the indentation level and column, as well as the wait_for_nl condition. We also need to ensure that the correct prefix and leftover string are returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = current_line.lstrip(' \t')
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function should now handle the indentation level and column correctly, as well as properly handle the wait_for_nl condition. This should ensure that the correct prefix and leftover string are returned, passing the failing test.
