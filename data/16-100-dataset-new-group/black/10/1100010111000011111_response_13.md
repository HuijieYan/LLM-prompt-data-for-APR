To fix the buggy function, we need to address the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The bug causes the comment to be incorrectly indented after a dedent, which is not the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect indentation when the input file uses tabs.

To address this issue, we need to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. We can achieve this by properly tracking the current indentation level and adjusting the behavior for comments.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue described in the GitHub report and ensure that the indentation for comments after a dedent is handled correctly, especially when the input file uses tabs.

The modified logic properly tracks the current indentation level and adjusts the behavior for comments to ensure correct indentation after a dedent, which should resolve the reported issue.
