The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to the handling of newlines and whitespace characters. The function is supposed to partially consume `prefix` up to a certain column value, but it fails to do so correctly in some cases. 

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` does not correctly handle the case when the column is reached within the current line. Additionally, the logic for tracking the `wait_for_nl` flag and handling different types of whitespace characters is incomplete.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for consuming the prefix and keeping track of line and column positions. We should handle the cases when the column is reached within the current line and properly manage the `wait_for_nl` flag to handle newline characters, spaces, and tabs.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues with handling line and column positions, as well as the logic for dealing with different types of characters. After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test.
