The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior with tabulated comments after a dedent. The issue is related to the incorrect reformatting of indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs. The function is not handling tabulated comments properly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle tabulated comments and preserve their indentation after a dedent. This can be achieved by updating the logic within the function to properly handle tab characters and maintain their relative indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                to_next_tabstop = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_line += ' ' * to_next_tabstop
                current_column += to_next_tabstop
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char in {' ', '\n'}:
                if char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function takes into account the presence of tab characters and properly processes their indentation. It ensures that the relative indentation of tabulated comments is preserved after a dedent. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
