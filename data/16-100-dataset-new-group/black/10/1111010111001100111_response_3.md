The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file. This function is designed to consume the prefix of a string up to a certain column, handling spaces, tabs, and newlines. The function has several conditional statements to handle different characters and increment the `current_column` value accordingly.

The bug causes incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag, resulting in incorrect prefix consumption and ultimately incorrect indentation. The function fails when handling tabulated comments after a dedent, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully handle the `wait_for_nl` flag and ensure that the prefix is correctly consumed up to the specified column.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for index, char in enumerate(prefix):
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through the characters of the prefix using `enumerate`, which gives us the index of the character. We then carefully handle the `wait_for_nl` flag and update the `current_column` based on the character encountered. The handling of tabs has been corrected to ensure the correct increment of `current_column`.

With this corrected version, the function should consume the prefix up to the specified column correctly, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
