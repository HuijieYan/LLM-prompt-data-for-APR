The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters (\t) when calculating the current column. This causes incorrect line indentation, especially for comments after a dedent.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle tab characters as part of the indentation calculation and adjust the line tracking accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # adjust for tab width
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles tab characters by adjusting the current_column based on the tab width. This should resolve the indentation issue for tabulated comments after a dedent.
