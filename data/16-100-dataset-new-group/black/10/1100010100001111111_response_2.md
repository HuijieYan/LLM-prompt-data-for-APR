The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior in the indentation of comments after a dedent. The function is not handling the tab characters properly, which leads to incorrect indentation. The function is not updating the `current_column` correctly when encountering tabs. This results in incorrect indentation and the issue reported in GitHub.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the tab characters and update the `current_column` value accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * next_tab_stop
            current_column += next_tab_stop
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles the tab characters and updates the `current_column` value accordingly. It ensures that the indentation is handled correctly, resolving the reported issue in GitHub.
