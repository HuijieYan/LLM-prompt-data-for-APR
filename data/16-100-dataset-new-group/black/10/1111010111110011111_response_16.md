## GitHub Issue
The updated function above resolves the issue reported on GitHub by correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent in the case of tabs indentation.

Thank you for providing the details required to fix this bug. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and correctly handle the expected input/output values.
