The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior in the `test_comment_indentation` test case. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, resulting in incorrect reformatting of the code.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the logic for handling whitespace characters, tabs, and newline characters. The `wait_for_nl` flag seems to be crucial for detecting the end of an indentation block and transitioning to the next line. However, there are inconsistencies in how this flag is being utilized.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to how the function fails to correctly handle whitespace characters and newlines, leading to incorrect indentation processing. This results in the incorrect reformatting of the code, as observed in the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling whitespace characters, tabs, and newline characters needs to be reviewed and adjusted. The `wait_for_nl` flag condition needs to be re-evaluated to ensure it accurately detects the end of an indentation block and transitions to the next line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust the tab width based on the current column
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now accurately handle indentation for comments after a dedent and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
