The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix of whitespace characters from the input string until a certain column. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could cause it to fail:

1. The variable `lines` is never reset, so the function accumulates lines from the input string even after the column limit is reached.
2. The logic for handling indentation using spaces and tabs is incorrect, which could result in the function not properly consuming the prefix.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking if the function correctly formats the indentation and comments in the input string. The failure indicates that the function does not correctly consume the prefix up to a specified column, leading to incorrect formatting.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column limit from the input string.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)  # Append the line before reaching the column limit
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)  # Append the line after reaching the column limit
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Only reset current_line and current_column if the line is not empty
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    lines.append(current_line)  # Append the last line
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles whitespace characters, indentation, and line breaks to consume the prefix up to the specified column limit from the input string. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and provide the expected output.
