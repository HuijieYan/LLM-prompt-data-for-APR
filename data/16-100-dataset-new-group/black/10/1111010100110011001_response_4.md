# The buggy function has an issue in its logic for handling indentation.

# The bug causes the function to incorrectly split the input prefix string, leading to unexpected output and failing the test case.

# The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the `wait_for_nl` flag, resulting in incorrect newline handling.

# The strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for handling indentation and newline characters, ensuring that the prefix is correctly split and returned.

# Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
