The cause of the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it does not handle the indentation of comments correctly when the input file uses tabs. This leads to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, causing the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation of comments when using tabs and updates the `current_column` correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':  # updated handling for tabs
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':  # updated handling for tabs
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now handles both spaces and tabs correctly, ensuring that the `current_column` is updated accordingly regardless of the input indentation style.

This updated function should now pass the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
