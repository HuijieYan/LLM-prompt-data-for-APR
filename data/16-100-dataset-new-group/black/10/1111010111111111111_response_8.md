The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with handling the indentation of comments in a specific scenario.

The issue arises when there is a comment at the same indentation level as the code, and the code is dedented. In such cases, the comment's indentation is not preserved, leading to incorrect formatting.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the indentation level of comments when there is a dedent. This results in the incorrect preservation of comment indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the preservation of comment indentation after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly preserve the indentation of comments at the same level as the code, even after a dedent.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub about incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when using tabs.
