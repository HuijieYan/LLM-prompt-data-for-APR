First, let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test and the GitHub issue. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the processing of tab and space indentation in the test cases provided. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the code formatter in the presence of comments with a mix of tabs and spaces.

Upon analyzing the function, the potential error locations within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function may be related to the handling of tab and space characters, especially in cases where comments are involved.

The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. This aligns with the description of the GitHub issue, where the indentation for comments is changed incorrectly after a dedent in the presence of tabs.

To fix this bug, we should focus on refining the logic for handling the indentation of comments, especially after a dedent when tabs are utilized.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = current_column + (4 - (current_column % 4))
            if next_tab_stop <= column:
                current_column = next_tab_stop
            else:
                current_column += 1  # consider tab as 1 char when over indent
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the logic for handling tab characters to ensure that the indentation is calculated correctly, especially when dealing with comments and dedents. This should address the incorrect behavior described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
