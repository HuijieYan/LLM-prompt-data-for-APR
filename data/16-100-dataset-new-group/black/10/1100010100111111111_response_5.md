The cause of the bug is that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. This results in incorrect reformatting when using the Black library.

The bug is due to the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl`). It fails to correctly identify when a comment is at the same indentation level as the next line after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation and waiting for a new line needs to be revised to correctly identify the indentation level of the comment and ensure it aligns with the next line after a dedent.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The key modification in the corrected version is the use of `len(current_line.expandtabs())` to calculate the effective length of the current line while considering the tab characters.

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, ensuring that they align with the next line as expected, even when the input file uses tabs.
