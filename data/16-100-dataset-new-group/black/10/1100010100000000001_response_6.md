## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue  # Add continue to skip the rest of the iteration

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check if the current line is not empty
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. The function loop through the characters in the prefix, building lines and checking for indentation levels.

1. Potential error locations:
   - The if-elif-else structure inside the for loop may not be handling all the conditions correctly.

2. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the indentation levels and the wait_for_nl flag. Additionally, the if condition for checking the current column's value is placed at the wrong location.

3. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Add a continue statement to the if condition block that checks for '\n' and move the condition checking for the current column's value to be inside the if block for '\n'.

4. Corrected version:
   - The corrected version includes the addition of a continue statement to properly handle the new line and indentation logic. It also relocates the condition to check the current column's value inside the block for '\n' to ensure the correct handling of prefixes.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly partially consume the prefix based on the specified column value and handle the new line and indentation logic properly.
