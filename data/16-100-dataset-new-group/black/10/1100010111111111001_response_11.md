The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case when the `wait_for_nl` flag is True and a non-space character is encountered. This results in incorrect handling of indentation levels and line content.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `for` loop to correctly handle the `wait_for_nl` flag and reset the current line and column when encountering a new line.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issue and handle the scenarios outlined in the failing tests. It ensures that the function correctly accumulates current lines and resets them when encountering new lines, while also properly handling indentation levels and line content.
