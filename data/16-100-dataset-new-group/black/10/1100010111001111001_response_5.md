The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly processes the input string `prefix` and `column`. The function incorrectly tracks the `current_column` while processing the input characters, and it does not correctly handle indentation with tabs and spaces, resulting in misaligned code. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle indentation with both tabs and spaces. A possible strategy would be to keep track of the indentation level and adjust the `current_column` based on the encountered characters. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
            continue
        if char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += (4 - current_column % 4)
            continue
        wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
        current_column += 1
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
