### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation of comments in the code. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is testing the behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when dealing with tab and space indentation. The error message comes from the failing assertion in the test, indicating that the actual output does not match the expected output.

The GitHub issue provides additional context on how the indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling 'wait_for_nl' and 'indent' sections in the function could be causing the incorrect handling of comments after a dedent.
2. The calculation of the current column might be incorrect when handling tab characters, leading to incorrect indentation.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug is causing incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. When the input file uses tabs, the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling 'wait_for_nl' and 'indent' sections to ensure correct handling of comments after a dedent.
2. Update the calculation of the current column when handling tab characters to ensure correct indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n' and current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        if wait_for_nl:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Updated to handle tab indentation correctly
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling 'wait_for_nl' and 'indent' sections has been updated to ensure correct handling of comments after a dedent. Additionally, the calculation of the current column when handling tab characters has been adjusted to correctly handle tab indentation.
