The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of line indentation and column tracking.

The cause of the bug: The function is not correctly tracking the column number when encountering tabs and newlines. This causes the function to incorrectly identify the indentation level and results in the incorrect output.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly track the column number when encountering tabs and newlines.
2. Ensure that the function accurately identifies the correct indentation level for the given input.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False

        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the tracking of the column number and the handling of newlines, the function should now pass the failing test.
