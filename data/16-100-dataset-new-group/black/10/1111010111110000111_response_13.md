## Correction:

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the indentation of comments in the presence of tabs. This results in the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. This is due to the incorrect handling of tab characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. This results in a discrepancy between the expected and actual output, as seen in the failing test and error message.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle indentation for comments after a dedent, especially in the presence of tab characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip():
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    if not char.isspace():
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    # unexpected empty line
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                else:
                    # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle tab characters correctly and produce the expected indentation for comments.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
