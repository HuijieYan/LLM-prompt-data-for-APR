The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic for handling indentation within the prefix string. It appears to incorrectly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect behavior when using tabs for indentation.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is designed to test the behavior of the function when dealing with comments and indentation. The error message shows that the actual output does not match the expected output for a specific input.

The expected input/output values for the function have been provided, along with the corresponding types. The failing test and the GitHub issue both indicate that the indentation for comments is being handled incorrectly after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs for indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for idx, char in enumerate(prefix):
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # adjust for tab width
        elif char in {'\n', '\r'}:
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            if idx < len(prefix)-1 and prefix[idx+1] == '\n':
                current_line += '\n'
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the handling of tabs for indentation has been adjusted to account for the tab width. Additionally, the logic for handling newlines has been updated to ensure correct behavior when dealing with different newline characters.

This fix should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles comments and indentation, as described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
