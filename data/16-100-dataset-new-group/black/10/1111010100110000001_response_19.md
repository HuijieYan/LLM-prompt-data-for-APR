1. The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix is part of the Driver class in the blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py file.

2. The potential error locations in the function are the logic for handling the indentation in the prefix and the resetting of the current_line and current_column variables.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the indentation correctly when encountering a comment in the prefix, leading to an incorrect output.

4. A strategy for fixing the bug is to properly handle the indentation and line processing logic in the function to ensure that the comment is correctly aligned in the output.

5. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                # unexpected empty line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the test case should pass without errors.
