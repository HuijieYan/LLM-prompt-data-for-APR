## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by incorrect handling of the indentation levels and columns in the input code. This results in the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the following changes were made to the function:
1. In the `wait_for_nl` block, the condition was updated to check if `current_column` is less than or equal to `column`, which ensures that the function includes the line with the comment at the correct indentation level.
2. The calculation for `current_column` was adjusted when encountering a tab character to handle the indentation properly and maintain the correct column count even with tab characters.

These changes address the incorrect indentation issue and ensure that the function processes the input code correctly.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
