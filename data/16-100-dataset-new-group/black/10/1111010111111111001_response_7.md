The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to produce incorrect results, leading to an assertion error. The function is not correctly handling indentation of comments and leading spaces.

To fix the bug, I would suggest modifying the logic within the `for` loop to properly track the indentation levels, handle different characters and properly split the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the indentation and comments correctly, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values.
