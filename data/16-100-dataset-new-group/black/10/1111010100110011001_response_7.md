The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error when handling indentation counts and characters in a string. It's intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a column value. However, it fails to do so correctly, leading to incorrect indentation.

The function seems to initialize the necessary variables but fails to update them correctly during the iteration through the `prefix` string. The `wait_for_nl` flag isn't being properly set, which affects the logic, causing incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `wait_for_nl` flag properly based on the characters being processed. Additionally, the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `lines` variables need to be updated according to the indentation counts and characters in the prefix string.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Update wait_for_nl when encountering newline
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # Always update wait_for_nl when encountered other characters
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and consume the prefix string based on the given column value. This should resolve the failing test case and satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
