The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix until a certain column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. The bug likely occurs when the function encounters a comment in the code, leading to incorrect indentation handling.

The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` is checking the indentation and formatting of code with comments under two different scenarios using tabs and spaces. The error message indicates that the behavior of the function is not as expected, leading to an `AssertionError` in the test.

The cause of the bug is related to the handling of comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function does not handle comments properly and fails to preserve the correct indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle comments and preserve the original indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    contains_comment = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column and not contains_comment:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                contains_comment = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            contains_comment = False
        elif char == '#':
            contains_comment = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have added a `contains_comment` flag to keep track of the presence of comments. When encountering a comment, the flag is set to true. Then, when checking for the correct column and indentation, we also consider the presence of a comment before returning the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

After applying these changes, the function should be able to handle comments and preserve the correct indentation, passing the failing test case.
