The cause of the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is that it does not handle tab characters (\t) correctly when processing the input prefix. This leads to incorrect calculations of the indentation level, causing the subsequent comments to be misaligned.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling tab characters and ensure that the indentation level is accurately tracked.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # calculate the number of spaces to add to reach the next multiple of 4
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this modification, the function correctly handles tab characters and ensures that the indentation level is accurately tracked, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.

Please note that this fix assumes a 4-space tab width, which is the common convention in Python. If the tab width is different, the calculation for the number of spaces to add would need to be adjusted accordingly.
