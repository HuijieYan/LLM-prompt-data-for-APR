The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is due to the mishandling of whitespace and newline characters. This results in incorrect indentation and straying from the expected behavior.

The issue is with the logic that updates the `lines` list and the `current_line` string. In particular, there is a discrepancy in the handling of spaces, tabs, and newlines. This causes incorrect tracking of the current column count and also leads to the premature return of the function.

To fix the bug, the function should maintain correct tracking of the current column count and handle whitespace and newline characters consistently.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and newline characters and provide the expected output for the failing tests.
