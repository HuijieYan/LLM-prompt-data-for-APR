The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly managing the indentation levels when processing the prefix. This leads to issues with the indentation of comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly updating the current_column and wait_for_nl variables when processing the prefix, leading to incorrect handling of the indentation levels.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly manage the indentation levels and handle the wait_for_nl condition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the indentation levels and resolve the issues with comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.
