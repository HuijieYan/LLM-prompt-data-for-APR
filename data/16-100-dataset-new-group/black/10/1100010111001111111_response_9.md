The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior with tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is not handling tabulated comments correctly, which results in the incorrect reformatting of comments in the failing test.

The potential error locations in the buggy function include the handling of tab characters and newline characters. The function is not correctly tracking the column count when encountering tab characters, which leads to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent. It fails to maintain the correct indentation level for tabulated comments, resulting in incorrect reformatting by the black library. This behavior aligns with the GitHub issue description, where the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to accurately track the column count when encountering tabs. Additionally, the handling of tabulated comments and their indentation level needs to be adjusted to ensure the correct behavior, especially after dedents.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = [""]
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if len(lines) == 1 and current_column < column:
                    # Check only for the first line
                    return lines[0], prefix[len(lines[0]):]

                lines.append("")
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces represented by the tab
            spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            for _ in range(spaces):
                lines[-1] += ' '
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
            lines.append("")
        else:
            # char is not a space, tab, or newline
            lines[-1] += char
            current_column += 1

    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

With these modifications, the function should now correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent and maintain the correct indentation level. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and make the failing test cases pass.
