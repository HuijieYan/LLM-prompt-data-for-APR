The bug in the provided function lies in the logic where the function decides whether or not a line break is expected. This logic is necessary to keep track of the current column. The bug can be traced to the `wait_for_nl` variable, which is not set to `True` in all necessary cases.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to update the logic for setting the `wait_for_nl` variable and adjusting the current column count. The condition for setting `wait_for_nl` should cover cases where a space or a tab is encountered as well as when a new line is reached. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = True   # set wait_for_nl to True initially
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]  # return the correct substring
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True  # set wait_for_nl to True when a line break is encountered
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        else:
            # reset wait_for_nl when other cases occur
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function ensures that the `wait_for_nl` variable is appropriately updated based on the encountered character, and the column count is correctly tracked. With this correction, the function should now work as intended and return the expected results.
