The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string and return a partially consumed prefix based on a given column. However, it fails to correctly handle the indentation and new line characters, resulting in incorrect output.

The potential error locations within the function are the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the conditions for updating variables like `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl`.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation and newline characters when processing the prefix string. This leads to incorrect calculations for the `current_line` and `current_column` variables, resulting in unexpected output.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately track the column position and handle the indentation and newline characters properly. This can be achieved by updating the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the conditions for updating the relevant variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines has been updated to accurately track the column position and handle the indentation and newline characters properly. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
