## Buggy Function Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class has a bug that is causing the failing test. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on indentation and line breaks, returning the consumed part of the string and the remaining unparsed part of the string.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for `char == '\n'` does not reset `current_column`.
2. The logic for handling tab (`\t`) characters may not be correctly updating `current_column`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from incorrect handling of newline characters and the tab character. When newline characters are encountered, it should reset the `current_column` to 0. Additionally, the logic for handling tab characters seems to be adding 4 to `current_column` instead of updating it based on the actual tab size.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reset the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character.
2. Adjust the logic for handling tab characters to update `current_column` correctly based on the actual tab size.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Adjust current_column based on actual tab size (e.g., 4 spaces)
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line = ""  # Reset current_line to empty string
                current_column = 0  # Reset current_column to 0 for newline
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By implementing these changes, the function should be able to correctly parse the prefix string based on indentation and line breaks, which will address the failing test case.
