## Explanation

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle the indentation and spacing correctly when consuming the prefix. This causes issues with the formatting of the output text, especially in cases where there are comments with different levels of indentation.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates the issue by comparing the formatted output for code with tabs and spaces, where the comments' indentation is not preserved.

The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output for the test case with tabs, specifically for the line with the comment.

The runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function show inconsistent behavior when dealing with different types of characters and indentation levels. This inconsistency causes incorrect handling of the prefix, leading to formatting issues.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the incorrect behavior is related to the handling of tabs and is causing incorrect indentation for comments.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation and spacing when consuming the prefix. Specifically, it should accurately track the current column and handle different types of characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) properly.

The correction should address issues related to the handling of tabs and incorrect indentation for comments, especially after a dedent.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
- Added handling for tabs to correctly track the column position by incrementing by 4 minus the remainder when the current column is divided by 4, accounting for tab size.
- Modified the condition for handling newline characters to properly add the current line to the list and reset the current column.
- Adjusted the condition for waiting for a newline to reset its value appropriately.

This corrected version addresses the issues related to incorrect handling of indentation and spacing, especially with tabs, as reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
