To fix the buggy function, we need to focus on the logic that handles the indentation and newline characters in the input prefix.

The cause of the bug is related to the way the function handles the indentation and newline characters, especially when a comment follows a dedent. The current logic fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, resulting in incorrect formatting.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling the special cases of indentation and newlines, ensuring that the comments are correctly indented after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.lstrip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
