The problem in the buggy function is that it doesn't correctly handle the indentations of the comment lines. As a result, it fails to properly consume the prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the function to correctly handle the indentation and consume the prefix as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    spaces_to_add = 0  # track spaces to add for indentation

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                # add the current line with the correct indentation
                lines.append(' ' * spaces_to_add + current_line)
                current_line = ""  # reset the current line
                current_column = 0  # reset the current column
                wait_for_nl = False  # reset the wait_for_nl flag

                # track new spaces to add for next line
                if prefix.index(char) < column:
                    spaces_to_add = column  # set the spaces_to_add to the specified column value
                else:
                    spaces_to_add = 0  # reset the spaces_to_add
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # assuming a tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
                current_line += ' ' * 4  # add 4 spaces for each tab
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(' ' * spaces_to_add + current_line.strip())  # add the current line with the correct indentation
                current_line = ""  # reset the current line
                current_column = 0  # reset the current column
                wait_for_nl = False  # reset the wait_for_nl flag
                spaces_to_add = 0  # reset the spaces_to_add
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return '\n'.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly account for the spaces and tabs in the indentation to correctly handle the given prefix. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
