The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a specific column, while keeping track of the current line and column. It appears that the issue arises when processing multi-line prefixes with comments and different levels of indentation.

The cause of the bug is related to the handling of indentation and wait states for new lines. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation levels and the wait for a new line in cases where comments are involved.

To fix the bug, the logic of the function needs to be adjusted to properly handle different levels of indentation and comments within a multi-line prefix.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        start_of_line = True
        for char in prefix:
            if start_of_line and char in [' ', '\t']:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
                start_of_line = False
                if char == '\n':
                    start_of_line = True
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected function properly handles the different levels of indentation and correctly identifies the start of a new line. It should address the issues with processing multi-line prefixes and comments, as observed in the failing test case.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test case and produce the expected output, which satisfies the input/output values specified. Additionally, this fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
