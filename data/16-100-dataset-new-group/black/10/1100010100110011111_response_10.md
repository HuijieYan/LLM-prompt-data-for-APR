## A corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # changed < to <=
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # moved this line outside the if condition
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The cause of the bug:
The bug in the function lies in how it handles the wait_for_nl condition for detecting the end of indentation. In the original code, the logic for handling newline characters in the string is incorrect, leading to incorrect indentation. As a result, the comments are not correctly indented after a dedent.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` to `if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:` to ensure correct handling of the column value.
2. Move the `lines.append(current_line)` outside the `if char == '\n':` condition to ensure that lines are correctly appended.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle indentation and address the issue reported on GitHub.
