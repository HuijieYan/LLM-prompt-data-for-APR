The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix string based on the specified column. It processes the input prefix character by character and updates the current line and column accordingly.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are at the conditions for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the logic for updating the current line and column.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. It fails to preserve the correct indentation of the comments in the input, especially with tabulation.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, ensuring that the comments are indented the same way as the next line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = []
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    line_indent = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if line_indent < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(''.join(current_line))
                current_line = []
                line_indent = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line.append(' ')
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line.append('\t')
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(''.join(current_line) + '\n')
            current_line = []
            line_indent = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            line_indent = current_column + 1

    return ''.join(lines), ''.join(current_line)
```

This corrected version of the function includes proper handling of tabulated indentation and ensures that comments are correctly indented after a dedent.

This should address the issue reported on GitHub as well as satisfy the expected input/output values.
