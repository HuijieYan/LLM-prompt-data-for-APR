The issue with the current function is that it incorrectly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent. This causes the comments to be indented differently than expected, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The root cause of the bug is that the function doesn't properly track the column position for tab characters, causing the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately handle the column position for tab characters and ensure that the comments are properly aligned with the code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, and the failing test should pass.
