To fix this bug, we need to address the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The issue seems to arise from the mishandling of tab characters ('\t') when calculating the current column position. We need to ensure that the tab characters are properly handled when determining the column position.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                tab_width = 4
                spaces_to_add = tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
                current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
                current_column += spaces_to_add
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have added a specific handling for tab characters. When a tab character is encountered, the code calculates the number of spaces needed to reach the next tab stop and adds those spaces to the current line. This ensures that the column position is correctly updated when encountering tab characters.

This fix should address the issue with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent as reported in the GitHub issue.
