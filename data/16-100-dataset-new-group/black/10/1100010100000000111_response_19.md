The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling tab characters properly, causing the indentation to be changed incorrectly after a dedent. The function does not handle tab characters (\t) correctly and incorrectly changes the indentation when encountering tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle tab characters and ensure that the indentation is maintained correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Update the logic for tab characters
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic for tab characters to properly handle the indentation, this corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
