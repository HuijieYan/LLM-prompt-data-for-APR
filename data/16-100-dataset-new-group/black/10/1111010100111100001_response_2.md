The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it doesn't properly handle prefix indentation when stripping out column values. It incorrectly calculates the length of the consumed prefix and doesn't consider the case of a newline character occurring in between the column values.

To fix this bug, the function should keep track of the consumed prefix and update the column value accordingly when a newline character is encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    consumed_prefix = ""
    for char in prefix:
        consumed_prefix += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(consumed_prefix):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            consumed_prefix = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(consumed_prefix):]
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
