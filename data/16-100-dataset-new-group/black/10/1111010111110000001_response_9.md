The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not properly handling the indentation level and comments in the input prefix. This results in the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`.

#### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused because the function does not handle the scenario where there is a comment `#` in the prefix text.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The function needs to be modified to handle the scenario when encountering the comment character `#`. It should also correctly handle the indentation levels.

#### Corrected version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = True
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '#':
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
With this corrected version, the function should now handle the indentation levels and comments properly, and pass the failing test case.
