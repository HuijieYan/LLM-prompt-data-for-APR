## The corrected version of the buggy function

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of `_partially_consume_prefix` function to ensure that the comment indentation is handled correctly.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab, modify if necessary
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the changes as shown above, the corrected function should handle the indentation of comments after a dedent correctly and pass the failing test. This also addresses the corresponding GitHub issue reported.
