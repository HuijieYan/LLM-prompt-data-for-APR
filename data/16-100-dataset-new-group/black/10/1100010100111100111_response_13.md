The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. The function seems to have a logic issue related to handling tab characters and indentation.

The cause of the bug can be inferred from the failing test and the runtime values and types of variables inside the function. In the failing test, the indent for the comment is being changed incorrectly after a dedent. This indicates that the function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments.

Looking at the runtime values, it seems that the function is not correctly updating the `current_column` when encountering tab characters and is not properly handling the wait for a new line. This results in incorrect handling of the indentation for comments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation for both spaces and tab characters, and properly track the current column and wait for a new line when necessary.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected logic, the function should now handle the indentation correctly for both spaces and tab characters, and properly track the current column and wait for a new line when necessary. This should resolve the issue with incorrect comment indentation.
