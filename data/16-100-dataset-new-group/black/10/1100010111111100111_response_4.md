The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. This is reflected in the failing test `test_comment_indentation` where the expected and actual outputs are not matching. The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem with indentation for comments after a dedent.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of lines and column positions in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It appears that the function is not correctly updating the line and column positions when encountering spaces or tabs, leading to incorrect indentation for comments.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the line and column positions are accurately maintained while traversing the prefix string and identifying the indentation levels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This modified function ensures that the line and column positions are updated correctly based on the characters encountered in the prefix string. This should address the bug and ensure that the indentation for comments after a dedent is handled accurately.

By applying these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation when using tabs.
