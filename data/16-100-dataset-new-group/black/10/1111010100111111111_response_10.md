### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior when handling comments and indentations. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation level of comments, especially when there are mixed tab and space characters. This is leading to an incorrect reformatting of the code by the `black` library.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation level of comments and ensure that they are reformatted properly by the `black` library.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust the column for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
1. Adjust the `current_column` for tabs to align with the indentation level correctly.
2. When encountering a newline character, reset the `current_column` and add the current line to the `lines` list if it's not empty.

By making these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments and ensure that they are reformatted properly by the `black` library. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
