The bug appears to be in the "_partially_consume_prefix" function, where the logic for handling different characters in the prefix and updating the variables is not working correctly.

The strategy for fixing the bug could be to refactor the logic in the function to correctly handle the different characters in the prefix and update the variables accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The updated logic ensures that the function correctly handles different characters in the prefix and updates the variables such as lines, current_line, current_column, and wait_for_nl appropriately.
