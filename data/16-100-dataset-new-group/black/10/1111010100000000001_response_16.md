## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The handling of tab characters (\t) to update the current_column variable may be incorrect.
2. The logic for wait_for_nl may not be working as expected, leading to unexpected behavior.
3. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` may not be functioning correctly.

## Cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. However, the handling of tab characters and the logic for waiting for a new line is causing unexpected behavior, leading to incorrect output.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that tab characters (\t) are correctly handled to update the current_column variable based on the defined indentation level.
2. Refine the logic for wait_for_nl to correctly handle spaces and new lines while consuming the prefix.
3. Modify the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` to accurately determine when to return the consumed prefix.
