The cause of the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not handle the indentation of comments correctly when the input file uses tabs.

The function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, causing incorrect reformatting when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to handle the indentation of comments correctly when using tabs as the input file's indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    comment_prefix = None
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            comment_prefix = None
        elif char == '#':
            comment_prefix = current_line
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if comment_prefix:
                current_column = len(comment_prefix)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should handle the indentation of comments correctly, especially when the input file uses tabs. It should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.

After implementing this fix, we should re-run the failing test to ensure that the bug has been resolved.
