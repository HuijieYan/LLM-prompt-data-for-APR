The cause of the bug is that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the indentation in the input string. This leads to incorrect comparison results and failing test cases.

The issue is that the logic for calculating the indentation level is not properly accounting for the different possible whitespace characters and how they should contribute to the indentation level.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling whitespace characters and newlines in the input string. We also need to ensure that the indentation level is correctly updated based on the encountered characters.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should handle the indentation and newline characters properly, ensuring that the correct prefix is consumed based on the specified column value.

With this correction, the function should be able to pass the failing test case and correctly satisfy the expected input/output values.
