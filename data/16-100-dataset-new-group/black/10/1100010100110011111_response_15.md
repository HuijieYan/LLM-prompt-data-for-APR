## Explanation:

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, keeping track of the lines and columns within the prefix. However, the function is not correctly handling the indentation and consumption of the prefix string. This is leading to incorrect behavior in the indentation of comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation levels and consuming the prefix string. This results in incorrect output for cases where comments are indented after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation levels, consume the prefix string, and preserve the correct formatting.

## Fixing the bug:

1. Update the logic for handling the whitespace characters and tabs to accurately keep track of the current column.

2. Ensure that when a new line is encountered, the function correctly handles the current column and resets the variables `current_line` and `wait_for_nl` as per the expected behavior.

3. After processing the prefix string, return the correct consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

4. Write test cases to cover various scenarios and ensure that the fixed function returns the expected values and types of variables for the given inputs.

With these changes, the function should correctly handle the indentation and consumption of the prefix string, resolving the reported GitHub issue.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[prefix.index(char):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
With this corrected version, the function should now correctly consume the prefix string up to the specified column and handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. This should resolve the reported GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output values.
