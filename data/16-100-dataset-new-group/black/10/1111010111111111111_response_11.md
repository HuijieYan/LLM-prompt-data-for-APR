## The corrected version of the buggy function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function includes a fix to the calculation of the column when encountering a tab character. In the corrected version, the `current_column` is incremented by 8 when encountering a tab character, as tabs are typically considered as equivalent to 8 spaces in Python.

This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
