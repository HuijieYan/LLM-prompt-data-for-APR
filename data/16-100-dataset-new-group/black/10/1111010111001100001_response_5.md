The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is that it is not properly handling the indentation detection and line consumption. The function is intended to consume part of a prefix string up to a specified column, but it fails to do so.

The issue is that the function does not properly handle the case where the prefix string does not contain any whitespace characters. As a result, it fails to correctly consume the prefix string up to the specified column.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly detect and handle indentation and consumption of the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this corrected version, the failing test for the test_comment_indentation function should pass.
