The bug in the provided function is that it does not properly handle indentation levels and newline characters. This causes the function to incorrectly consume the prefix and return an incorrect result.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly resetting the current_line and current_column variables, which results in an incorrect prefix being returned.

To fix this bug, we need to reset the current_line and current_column variables when a newline character is encountered, and also handle the indentation level properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4

        lines.append(current_line)

    consumed = ''.join(lines)
    return consumed, prefix[len(consumed):]
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the indentation levels and newline characters, which should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
