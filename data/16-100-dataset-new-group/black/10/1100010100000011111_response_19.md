The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string and handle indentation levels in the context of Python code. However, it fails to correctly handle tabs, resulting in incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not account for the correct handling of tab characters ('\t') when calculating the column position. This leads to incorrect indentation manipulation and results in the reported issue on GitHub.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters ('\t') and adjust the column position based on the Python standard of 4 spaces for each tab. Additionally, the function should handle different types of indentation characters (spaces and tabs) consistently.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces to add based on the Python tab width
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly handle tab characters ('\t') by converting them to the appropriate number of spaces. This ensures that the column position is incremented correctly based on the Python tab width. Additionally, the function maintains consistent handling of space and tab characters throughout the indentation process.

This corrected version of the function should address the reported issue on GitHub and provide the expected output values for the given test cases.
