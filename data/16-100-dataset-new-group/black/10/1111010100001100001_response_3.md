The buggy function has an issue with the logic for updating the current line and the wait_for_nl variable. It does not correctly handle the situation when a new line character is encountered and when to wait for a new line character. The conditions inside the for loop seem to be misconfigured.

The prefix string should be iterated character by character until the column value is reached or a newline character is encountered and the current line is returned along with the remaining prefix string.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column == column:
                remaining_prefix = prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
                return ''.join(lines) + current_line, remaining_prefix
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

This corrected version iterates through the prefix string character by character, updating the current line and column count accordingly. When the column count reaches the specified value, it returns the current line and the remaining prefix string. If the prefix is fully consumed, it returns the entire prefix string and an empty string for the remaining prefix.
