## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string based on a given column value. The function maintains the current line, column, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to keep track of the processing status.

## Identified potential error location:
The potential error in the original function is in the handling of newline characters (`\n`) and the logic to wait for the next newline.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` logic, which does not properly reset the `wait_for_nl` flag after encountering a newline character. Additionally, there is a missing check for empty lines.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Set `wait_for_nl` to True when encountering a newline character.
2. Update the logic to properly reset `wait_for_nl` when necessary.
3. Add a check to skip empty lines.

## Corrected Version:
The corrected version of the function includes the fix for handling newline characters and properly resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag when necessary. Additionally, it includes a check to skip empty lines.
