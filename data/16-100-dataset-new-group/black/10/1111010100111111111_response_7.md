The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly consuming the prefix string and returning the consumed and remaining parts. The function is not properly handling the indentation and newline characters, leading to incorrect behavior, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level and the newline characters when consuming the prefix string. This causes discrepancies in the expected and actual output, leading to failed tests and the reported issue on GitHub.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation, newline characters, and the wait state for the newline. Specifically, we need to adjust the logic for updating the current column and for detecting the indentation completion.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # handle tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                if wait_for_nl:  # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = False
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues with incorrect indentation and newline handling, and it should pass the failing tests and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
