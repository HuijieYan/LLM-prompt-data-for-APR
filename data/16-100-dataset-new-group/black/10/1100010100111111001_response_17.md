The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is most likely due to the incorrect calculation of the `res` variable and the logic related to the `wait_for_nl` flag. The function is designed to consume characters from the `prefix` string until reaching a specific column value, after which it should return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix.

The program logic needs to be adjusted to correctly handle different scenarios, such as counting spaces and tabs as well as recognizing line breaks.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to ensure that the correct characters of the prefix are being consumed and returned.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column += 1
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected output.
