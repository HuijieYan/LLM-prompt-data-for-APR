The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior in the code formatting. The function is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column number, but the logic is incorrect and leads to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the logic for handling indentation and new lines, as well as the condition for checking the column number.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and new lines when consuming the prefix string. This leads to incorrect column calculations and results in wrong indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle the indentation and new lines, and to accurately track the column number when consuming the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test. It correctly handles indentation, new lines, and column calculations, ensuring that comments are indented properly after a dedent.
