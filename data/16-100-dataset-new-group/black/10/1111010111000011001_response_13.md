The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a few logical errors in its implementation. It's intended to process a prefix string, track the column position, and remove consumed characters while handling indentation. 

There are a few issues:
1. The logic to track the column position is incorrect and may lead to incorrect indentation values being returned.
2. The logic to handle indentation with spaces and tabs is incorrect.
3. There's a redundant check for the current_line not being empty before appending it to the lines list.

A strategy to fix the bug would involve correcting the logic for tracking the column position, fixing the handling of spaces and tabs, and removing the redundant check for the current_line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy all the expected input/output variable values for each test case.
