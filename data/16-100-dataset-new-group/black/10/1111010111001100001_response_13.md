The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has several issues that prevent it from correctly consuming the prefix and updating the variables. The main issue is that it does not handle the indentation level properly when the comment is encountered after a block of code, causing the output to be incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly update the `lines` list to store the consumed lines. We also need to reset the `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a new line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            break
        current_line += char

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the prefix consumption correctly and produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
