## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file. The function is responsible for processing a given prefix string based on indentation and other characters.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates a specific scenario where comments with tabs are being incorrectly indented after a dedent operation.

The GitHub issue reported by a user provides a specific example of how the indentation for comments is being incorrectly changed after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically in the logic related to handling tab characters and indentation levels. It seems that the function fails to correctly track the current indentation level and handle comments after a dedent operation, especially when using tabs.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to correctly handle indentation levels, especially when encountering tabs and managing comments after a dedent operation. The function needs to accurately identify the current indentation level and ensure that comments are correctly indented based on the surrounding code.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    prev_char = None  # Track the previous character for indentation purposes
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Handle tab characters for indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            prev_char = None  # Reset prev_char for each new line
        else:
            if prev_char == '\t' or prev_char == ' ':
                wait_for_nl = True
        prev_char = char  # Update prev_char for the next iteration
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes handling for tab characters and accurately tracks the previous character to manage indentation levels and correctly handle comments after a dedent operation. This should resolve the reported issue and make the `test_comment_indentation` test pass.
