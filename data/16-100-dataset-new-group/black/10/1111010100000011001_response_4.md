## Corrected and improved version of the buggy function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The original code has multiple logic issues, including incorrect handling of indentation and newline characters and incorrect handling of the "wait_for_nl" flag. 

The revised code addresses these issues by properly updating the "wait_for_nl" flag and handling newline characters and indentation. It also correctly appends the current line to the list of lines when encountering a newline character.

This revised code should now correctly consume the prefix and return the expected values based on the input parameters.
