Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition for checking if the current character is a newline character is not properly nested within the previous condition.
2. The logic for updating the line column count when encountering a tab character may be incorrect.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function causes it to incorrectly identify and consume the prefix up to a specific column limit. This leads to incorrect output when the function is called.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Properly nest the condition for checking if the current character is a newline character within the previous condition.
2. Update the logic for updating the line column count when encountering a tab character to ensure it reflects the correct number of spaces.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# corrected function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming 4 spaces for a tab
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
