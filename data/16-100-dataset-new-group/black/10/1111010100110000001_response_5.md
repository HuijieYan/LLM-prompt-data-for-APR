### Analysis
The `Driver` class has a function `_partially_consume_prefix` which seems to be parsing a prefix string and checking for indentation and line wrapping. The failing test indicates a difference in the expected and actual results, possibly due to indentation and line wrapping issues.

### Identified potential error locations
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` may be causing issues in identifying the correct substring of the prefix.
2. The logic for handling different characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) may not be correct.

### Cause of the bug
The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of the current line and the column count. This seems to be leading to incorrect parsing of the prefix string, resulting in the mismatch between expected and actual results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
A possible strategy to fix the bug would be to carefully handle the tracking of the current line and column while parsing the prefix. This could involve correcting the logic for checking the indentation and line wrapping and ensuring that the correct substring of the prefix is extracted.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to correctly handle the tracking of the current line and column, and to ensure the correct substring of the prefix is extracted. This should address the issues identified and hopefully pass the failing test.
