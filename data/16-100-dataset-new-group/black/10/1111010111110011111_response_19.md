                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The buggy function is incorrectly handling the newline character when there is a change in the indentation level. To solve the bug, I have added an if condition for the newline character within the for loop. This condition ensures that if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column, the function returns the processed lines and the remaining prefix.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
