## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Explanation
The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the indentation when encountering tab characters. This leads to incorrect behavior when reformatting the code, as observed in the failing test and reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the code needs to properly handle the indentation caused by tab characters by adjusting the `current_column` when encountering a tab. The corrected version of the function includes this adjustment, ensuring that the indentation is calculated correctly for both spaces and tabs.

By making this adjustment, the expected input/output values will be satisfied, and the reported issue in the GitHub report will be resolved.
