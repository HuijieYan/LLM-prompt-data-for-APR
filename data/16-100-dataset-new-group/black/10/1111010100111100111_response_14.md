The cause of the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it incorrectly handles the indentation of comments. This is leading to the incorrect output and causing the failing test. Specifically, the function is not properly handling the case where a comment is indented the same as the next line after a dedent.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling comments and their indentation within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            current_line += char
        
        lines.append(current_line)
        return ''.join(lines), ''

```

With this corrected version, the function should properly handle the indentation of comments and address the issue reported on GitHub.
