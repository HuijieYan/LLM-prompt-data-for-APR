The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix() is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a specified column number. It works by iterating through the prefix string and building lines of text until the specified column is reached.

The potential error locations in the function are the conditions for checking 'wait_for_nl', as well as the logic for updating 'current_column' and 'lines'.

The cause of the bug in the current function is that it does not handle the case where the prefix string ends before reaching the specified column number. This results in the function returning an incomplete result and leaving some characters unprocessed.

To fix the bug, we can add a check at the end of the function to handle the case where the prefix string ends before reaching the specified column number. If this occurs, we should return the entire prefix string as the partially consumed result, and an empty string as the remaining prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    # Check if prefix ends before reaching the specified column
    if current_column < column:
        return prefix, ""

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version, we added a check at the end of the function to handle the case where the prefix string ends before reaching the specified column. If this occurs, we return the entire prefix string as the partially consumed result, with an empty string as the remaining prefix.
