The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely related to how the function handles the wait_for_nl condition and the indentation calculations. Based on the runtime values and expected values, it seems that the function is not properly resetting the `current_column` and the `wait_for_nl` flags.

The cause of the bug is that when the function encounters a new line character, it is not correctly resetting the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flag. This results in incorrect handling of the indentation when encountering new lines, as seen in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation handling for tabulated comments.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a new line character is encountered, the `current_column` is reset to 0, and the `wait_for_nl` flag is updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset current_column and wait_for_nl
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes the proper handling of the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering new line characters. It should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub related to incorrect indentation handling.
