The cause of the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it does not handle the case where the comment starts in the same line as the previous code and the indentation of the comment is less than the specified column.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the function to correctly handle the case where the comment starts in the same line as the previous code and the indentation of the comment is less than the specified column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the indentation properly and pass the failing test cases.
