The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag. This flag is responsible for indicating whether the function should wait for a new line character before continuing to process the prefix string. There are also issues with updating the `current_column` variable.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is toggled correctly and that the `current_column` is updated appropriately when encountering different types of characters, such as spaces, tabs, or newlines.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have changed the order of the conditions to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is toggled correctly and updated the `current_column` variable based on different types of characters. This should resolve the issues identified in the test cases.
