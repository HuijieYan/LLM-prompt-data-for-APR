The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs for indentation. Based on the runtime values and types of variables, it appears that the function is not correctly tracking the column position and handling the indentation and newline characters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly considering the column position when encountering newline characters and not handling tab characters correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately calculate the column position when encountering different types of characters, such as spaces, tabs, and newlines. Additionally, it needs to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line  # Return the remaining line as well
```

With these modifications, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and newline characters, and accurately track the column position. This should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used for indentation.
