The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it is not correctly handling the cases when a newline character is encountered. The function should properly reset the `current_line` and `current_column` variables when encountering a newline character. This is causing the function to not accumulate the correct lines and not properly consume the input prefix.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the different cases of encountering spaces, tabs, and newline characters in the input prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles the accumulation of lines and the consumption of the prefix based on the specified column. It should now satisfy all the provided test cases.
