The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix string up to a certain column in order to handle indentation in code. However, based on the runtime values and the expected values, it fails to handle the indentation properly, especially when dealing with tabs.

The main issue with the function is the way it handles the tab characters, which causes incorrect indentation when the input file uses tabs.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the tab characters and adjust the current column accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # calculate the number of spaces to add to reach the next tab stop
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1  # increment the column for non-tab characters

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function properly handles tab characters and adjusts the current column based on the tab stops. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation when using tabs.
