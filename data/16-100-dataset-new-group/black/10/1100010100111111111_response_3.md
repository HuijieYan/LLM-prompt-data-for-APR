## The corrected version of the function

# this is the corrected function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Changed from 4 to 8 to align with tab size
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

**Explanation:**
The issue with the original function is that it did not handle tab characters correctly, causing incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent in the failing tests.

In the corrected version:
1. Changed the increment for tab characters from 4 to 8 to align with the standard tab size.
2. Adjusted the condition `if current_column < column` to `if current_column <= column` to ensure that comments are aligned correctly even at the same level as the column.

These changes ensure that the function correctly handles tab characters and maintains the expected indentation level for comments even after a dedent.

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub.
