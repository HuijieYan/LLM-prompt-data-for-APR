The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling multi-line comments. The function is expected to return a string and the remaining prefix after consuming lines and columns up to a certain indicator. However, it fails to properly handle multi-line comments and incorrectly handles spaces and tabs when counting the number of columns.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to correctly handle multi-line comments and correctly count the number of columns based on spaces and tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle multi-line comments and column counting, ensuring that the failing test cases you provided will pass.
