The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after dedent when using tabs in the input file. The function is designed to consume a prefix from the input and update the current line and column values accordingly. However, it is not handling tab characters correctly and is causing the indentation issue described in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the handling of tab characters and the logic for updating the current column when encountering different types of characters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly accounting for tab characters when updating the current column. This leads to incorrect indentation when dealing with comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters by incrementing the `current_column` by 1 for each tab character encountered, instead of adding 4 as is currently done. Additionally, the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables needs to be adjusted to account for proper indentation handling.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # increment current_column by 1 for each tab character
        else:
            current_column += 1  # increment current_column by 1 for other characters
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function properly handles tab characters and updates the current column and `wait_for_nl` logic to ensure correct indentation. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
