## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
1. The original `if current_line.strip()` has been replaced with `if current_line.rstrip()` because we want to check for the whitespace characters at the end of the line, not at the beginning.
 
2. The condition for `elif char == '\t'` has been updated to calculate the new value of `current_column` consistently based on the existing value.

3. Added a new 'elif' condition for `char == '\n'` to handle the case where new lines are encountered.

4. Modified the return statement in the condition for `char == '\n'` to correctly handle the new lines.

5. The `current_line` is now updated within the `else` block to accumulate characters until the end of the indentation.

By making these changes, the function now correctly handles the indentation and new lines, ensuring that the correct prefix is returned.

This corrected version should address the reported issue and pass the failing test.
