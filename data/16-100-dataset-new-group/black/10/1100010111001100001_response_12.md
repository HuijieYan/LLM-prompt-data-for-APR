The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because it does not correctly handle the logic for consuming the prefix while maintaining the appropriate indentation level. This results in incorrect output, causing the failing tests.

The function fails to correctly track the current column position and handle indentation with tabs and spaces. It also fails to correctly update the `lines` list and the `current_line` string.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for tracking the current column position, handling tabs and spaces, and updating the `lines` list and `current_line` string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            else:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

        else:
            if char in [' ', '\t']:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        if char != '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly consume the prefix, maintain the correct indentation level, and return the expected output, passing the failing test.
