The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to have a problem with handling the indentation of a comment within the given code. The `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables are not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect results and failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the indentation of the comment line. It fails to correctly track the current column index and wait for the next new line. This leads to incorrect results when attempting to consume the prefix of the input.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly tracks the current column index and waits for the next new line when necessary. We can achieve this by adjusting the logic related to handling spaces, tabs, and new lines within the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments to the logic inside the function, it should now correctly handle the indentation of comments and produce the expected results. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
