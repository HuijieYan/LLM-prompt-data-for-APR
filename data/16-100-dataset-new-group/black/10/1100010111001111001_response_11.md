The problem seems to be that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and waiting for a new line in certain cases, leading to incorrect line breaks and incorrect indentation levels. 

To fix this, we should update the if-elif-else blocks for handling spaces, tabs, and new lines to properly handle indentation and new lines. Additionally, we need to restructure the logic for updating the current line and line list to correctly handle the indentation level and wait for a new line when necessary.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                if char.strip():  # Check if the character is not empty (e.g. whitespace)
                    current_line = char
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            if char.strip():  # Check if the character is not empty (e.g. whitespace)
                current_line = char
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now properly handle the indentation and waiting for a new line as expected. This should address the issues identified in the failing tests and ensure that the function returns the correct prefix and remaining string based on the specified column.
