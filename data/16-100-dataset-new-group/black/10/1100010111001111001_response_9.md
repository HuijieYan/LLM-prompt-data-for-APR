The issue with the current implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that the condition for updating the `current_column` is incorrect, leading to an incorrect value for `current_column` and `lines`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditions for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` are not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters in the prefix string. This results in incorrect values for `current_column` and `lines`, which causes the function to return an incorrect result compared to the expected output.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditions for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` to correctly handle the indentation and newline characters in the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
