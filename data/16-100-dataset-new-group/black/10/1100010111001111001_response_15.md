The issue with the buggy function seems to be in the logic for updating the current_column value and handling the wait_for_nl flag. It appears that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation level of comments and the presence of newlines.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic of the function to correctly handle spaces, tabs, and newlines, while keeping track of the current column and waiting for a newline after encountering non-whitespace characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
