The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The function is designed to process a prefix string and a column value, but it fails to properly handle the indentation of comments.

Upon analyzing the provided runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it is evident that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments, especially when the input file uses tabs.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the handling of tab characters and the logic for determining the current column position. The function seems to have issues with accurately tracking the indentation level, especially when encountering tabs and newlines.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect interpretation of tab characters and the logic for updating the current_column value. This leads to the misalignment of comments and incorrect handling of indentation after a dedent.

To fix the bug, one possible strategy is to revise the logic for processing tab characters and updating the current_column value accordingly. Additionally, special attention should be given to the handling of comments and their indentation levels after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        else:
            current_line += char
    
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for processing tab characters has been revised to accurately update the current_column value. Additionally, the logic for handling newline characters and updating the lines list has been modified to ensure correct indentation levels, especially for comments after a dedent.
