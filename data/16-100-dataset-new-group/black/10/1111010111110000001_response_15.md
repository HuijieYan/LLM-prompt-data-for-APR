The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class is designed to partially consume the prefix of a given input string based on certain column constraints. The function is used to modify the prefix in such a way that it addresses indentation and maintains proper column alignment.

The error in the provided function seems to be related to handling tab and space characters and automatically adjusting the indentation based on the provided `column` value. This leads to incorrect alignment of the lines in the processed output, which causes the failing test and the corresponding assertion error.

Based on the failing test and the error message, it seems that the buggy function is not correctly consuming the prefix and adjusting the indentation levels as expected, leading to misaligned lines in the processed output.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to accurately track the column positions, handle tab and space characters properly, and adjust the indentation levels based on the provided `column` value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        spaces_to_add = column - current_column
                        current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # assuming each tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
            else:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines) + current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if the current column is less than the required column value and adds spaces to align the text properly. It also properly handles tab characters and adjusts the column position accordingly.

With these modifications, the corrected function should pass the failing test and produce the expected output.
