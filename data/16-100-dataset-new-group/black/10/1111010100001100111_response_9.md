The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string while keeping track of the current column and lines. Based on the provided runtime values and types of variables, as well as the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to incorrect handling of tabs and their impact on indentation within comments. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle tab characters when calculating the current column and lines, leading to indentation issues in the output code.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tab characters, taking into account their impact on indentation. The tab characters should be treated as advancing the column position by 4 spaces, instead of just 1 space.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    # this is the fixed version of the buggy function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                char = ' ' * (4 - (current_column % 4))
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]

                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    # unexpected empty line
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have added a specific handling for tab characters, ensuring that the current column is advanced by 4 spaces for each tab encountered. This should address the issue with incorrect indentation when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.
