The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is failing to correctly handle the indentation level while consuming the prefix string. This is causing the test case `test_comment_indentation` to fail.

The buggy function is not properly updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables when encountering tabs or spaces, resulting in incorrect indentation being returned.

To fix the bug, you can update the function to correctly handle both spaces and tabs, and properly track the indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

With this corrected version, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle indentation and pass the failing test case.
