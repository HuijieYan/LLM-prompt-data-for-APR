                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)  # move this line to append the current line before resetting it
                current_line = ""  # reset the current line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The bug was caused by the incorrect handling of the indentation in the presence of tabs. The condition for checking if the current line is less than the specified column needs to include the equal to operator to properly handle the indentation. Additionally, the 'current_line' needs to be appended to 'lines' before being reset when encountering a new line character.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
