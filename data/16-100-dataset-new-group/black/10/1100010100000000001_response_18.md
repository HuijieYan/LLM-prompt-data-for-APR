Buggy Function Analysis:
- The function '_partially_consume_prefix' takes 'prefix' and 'column' as input and partially consumes the prefix until a certain column is reached.
- It seems that the function is intended to split the input prefix into lines based on the given column and return the consumed lines along with the remaining prefix.

Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for consuming the prefix and handling the column position may have some errors.
2. The conditions for checking spaces, tabs, and newlines may not be accurately implemented.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the column position and newline characters, which leads to incorrect consumption of the prefix.

Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review and update the logic for consuming the prefix to accurately handle the column position and newline characters.
2. Use proper conditional checks for spaces, tabs, and newline characters to ensure correct consumption of the prefix.

Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks for spaces, tabs, and newlines are appropriately handled within the loop. The logic for consuming the prefix based on the given column position is revised to address the bug.
