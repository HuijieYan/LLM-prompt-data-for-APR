The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing the test to fail. Looking at the error message, it seems that the indentations are not being handled correctly, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

The potential error location is likely in the logic for tracking the current column and handling whitespace characters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level and consuming the prefix.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that the function correctly tracks the current column and handles whitespace characters, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and consume the prefix, passing the failing test.
