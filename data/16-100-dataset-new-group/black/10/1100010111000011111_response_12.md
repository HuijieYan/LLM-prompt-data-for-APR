To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, we need to address the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The issue seems to be related to the handling of whitespace characters and newlines.

After analyzing the function and the failing test, it seems that the bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line after a dedent. The indentation of the comment line is not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect output.

Based on the expected values and types of variables, it is clear that the function is not handling the indentation and newline characters properly.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for handling whitespace characters, newlines, and comments. We need to ensure that the indentation of comment lines is preserved after a dedent operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the indentation of comment lines correctly after a dedent operation. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.
