The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The function seems to be incorrectly parsing the prefix and not preserving the correct indentation level for tabulated comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the indentation levels, especially for tab characters. The logic for tracking the current column when encountering tab characters is incorrect and is leading to incorrect indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for tracking the current column when encountering tab characters and ensure that the correct indentation level is preserved for tabulated comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces
            current_column += spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by correctly handling the indentation level when encountering tab characters and ensuring that tabulated comments are preserved with the correct indentation.
