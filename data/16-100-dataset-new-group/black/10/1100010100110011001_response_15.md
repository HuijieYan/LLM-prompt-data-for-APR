The `current_line` variable is not being handled correctly within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. This is causing the lines to be incorrectly concatenated and leading to the wrong output. 

Additionally, the function is not correctly identifying the wait_for_nl condition and handling the tab and space characters. 

To fix this bug, the function needs to track the current position of the cursor within the prefix string and correctly handle the tab and space characters to calculate the correct indentation level.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = False
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should pass all the given test cases and provide the expected output.
