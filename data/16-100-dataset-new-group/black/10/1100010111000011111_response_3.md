To fix the bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to handle the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent with tabs. The issue mentioned in the GitHub report indicates that the incorrect indentation occurs for tabulated comments after a dedent. 

To fix the bug, we need to consider the logic for handling tab characters in the input prefix. We need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for comments after dedent with tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the current_column by 4 to handle tab characters
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # adjust the column to the next tab stop
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset the column count for each new line
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes a specific handling for tab characters, ensuring that the `current_column` is adjusted correctly for tabs. This should address the bug and ensure that the function handles the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent with tabs.
