The issue in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to how it handles the indentation of a comment in the test cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the indentation of comments when converting between space and tab indentation.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the function correctly handles both space and tab indentation while preserving the indentation of comments in the test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    prev_char = ''  # to keep track of the previous character for handling tab indentation
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces to add based on the previous character
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4) if prev_char == '\t' else 1
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        prev_char = char  # update the previous character
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to handle both space and tab indentation correctly, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
