The bug in the function \_partially_consume_prefix is that when a new line character is encountered, it resets the current column count to 0 regardless of whether it is within an indented block or not. This causes issues when processing the prefix and results in incorrect indentation.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling new line characters to correctly handle the indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
                # unexpected indent or character
                current_line += char
                continue
            wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now handle the indentation correctly and pass the failing test case.
