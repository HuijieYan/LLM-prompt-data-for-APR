The potential error in the buggy function might be due to the incorrect handling of indentation and newline characters, leading to inaccurate column counting and appending the wrong lines to the list.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect calculation of the `current_column` when processing spaces and tabs.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately update the `current_column` value based on the number of spaces or tabs encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
                
                # Handling the case when the current_column is already beyond the target column
                if current_column > column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines) + current_line
```
