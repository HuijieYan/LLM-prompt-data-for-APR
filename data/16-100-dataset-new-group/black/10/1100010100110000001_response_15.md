The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation for lines with comments in the `contents_tab` variable and is causing the `assertFormatEqual` test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the indentation correctly when encountering a comment. It mistakenly consumes the spaces or tabs after the comment, resulting in incorrect indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation when encountering a comment.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    comment_indent = None
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line[:comment_indent].strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                comment_indent = None
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            comment_indent = None
        elif char == '#':
            comment_indent = current_column
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            comment_indent = None
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation when encountering a comment, and the failing test should pass.
