The bug in the function is due to incorrect handling of the current_line and current_column variables during the iteration through the prefix string. The function is not properly updating the current_line and current_column variables based on the characters in the prefix string.

To fix the bug, we need to update the current_line and current_column variables correctly when encountering different types of characters (space, tab, newline) in the prefix string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should now handle the different cases for updating the current_line and current_column variables correctly, as well as correctly returning the remaining prefix after consuming a valid prefix.
