The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column parameter. However, the function fails to handle the indentation and newline characters properly, resulting in incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the logic for handling the wait_for_nl flag and the calculation of the current_column value based on different types of characters.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles the indentation and newline characters, leading to the incorrect consumption of the prefix string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling indentation, tab characters, and newlines in the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            if not wait_for_nl:  # Ignore space characters if waiting for a newline
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            if not wait_for_nl:  # Ignore tab characters if waiting for a newline
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the consumption of the prefix string and adjust the indentation based on the given column parameter.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
