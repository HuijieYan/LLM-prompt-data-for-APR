The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This is reflected in the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, which is failing when the input file uses tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the indentation correctly when encountering comments after a dedent. This is resulting in incorrect indentation for tabulated comments in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation and spacing when encountering comments after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = (char == '#')
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should pass, and the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent should be handled correctly.

This should also resolve the issue posted in GitHub regarding incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent when using tabs.
