The bug in the function is that when the character is a newline, it does not correctly handle the indentation. Instead, it sets the current column to 0, which results in an indentation error. This causes the function to produce incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic when encountering a newline character. We need to reset the `current_column` to the index of the last tab or space character plus 1, instead of simply setting it to 0.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset the current_column to the index of the last tab or space character plus 1
            last_tab = current_line.rfind('\t')
            last_space = current_line.rfind(' ')
            current_column = max(last_tab, last_space) + 1 if last_tab >= 0 or last_space >= 0 else 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This should fix the indentation issue and produce the correct output for the failing test cases.
