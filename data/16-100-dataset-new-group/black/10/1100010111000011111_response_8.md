To fix the buggy function, we need to adjust the logic for handling indentation and comments. The current function fails to correctly process the indentation for comments after a dedent. This is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to produce incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent. It fails to account for the logic required to maintain the correct indentation level for comments.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. We need to ensure that the function properly tracks the indentation level and preserves the correct indentation for comments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check if the current line is a comment and adjust the indentation
            if '#' in current_line:
                comment_index = current_line.index('#')
                if comment_index <= current_column:
                    current_column = comment_index
            # Add the adjusted line to the list of lines
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Update the line and column for non-indentation characters
            pass

    # Add the remaining line to the list of lines
    lines.append(current_line)

    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

This corrected version of the function includes logic to properly adjust the indentation for comments and preserve the correct indentation level. It should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
