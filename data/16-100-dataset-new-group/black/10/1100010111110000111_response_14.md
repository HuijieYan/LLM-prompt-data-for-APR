The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing the indentation issue when dealing with tabs and comments. The function incorrectly handles the indentation for comments after a dedent, resulting in incorrect reformatting. 

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs, leading to incorrect reformatting of the code.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.expandtabs().lstrip().startswith("#") and current_column < column: # check for comment indentation
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t': # update tab indentation
            current_column += 4
        elif char == ' ': # update space indentation
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
