The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it returns the wrong part of the input string `prefix` when the indentation level is not reached. This is causing the failing test as it expects the correct indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the function to correctly handle the cases when the indentation level is not reached.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        if current_column >= column:
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test.
