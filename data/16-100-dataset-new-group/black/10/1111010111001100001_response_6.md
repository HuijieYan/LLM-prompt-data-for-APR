The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it incorrectly updates the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables, causing the function to return the incorrect result. These errors are likely causing the failing test cases.

The strategy to fix the bug is to update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables in the correct conditions and handle the logic for correctly consuming the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and (current_column <= column or not lines):
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above changes, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test case.
