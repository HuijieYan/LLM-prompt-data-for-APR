The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing an error related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is intended to partially consume the input prefix and return the consumed part plus the remaining part. However, it fails to handle the indentation properly, resulting in the incorrect output.

The potential error location is likely in the handling of tab characters, spaces, and newlines within the loop that iterates over the characters in the prefix.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle tab characters properly when calculating the indentation level. As a result, the indentation is not correctly preserved for tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are properly accounted for when calculating the indentation level, and handle them consistently with spaces.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_add
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function accurately handles tab characters by converting them to spaces and appropriately updating the `current_column` variable. Therefore, when this corrected function is used, it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
