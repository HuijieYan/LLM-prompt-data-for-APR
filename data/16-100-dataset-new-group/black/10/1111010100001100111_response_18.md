The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation when processing the prefix string. This leads to incorrect behavior and affects the formatting of comments and code when using tabs.

The function fails to properly track and update the current indentation level, leading to incorrect handling of the input prefix string, and ultimately resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately keep track of the current indentation level and handle tab characters properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                next_tab_stop = ((current_column + 4) // 4) * 4
                current_line += ' ' * (next_tab_stop - current_column)
                current_column = next_tab_stop
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

In this corrected version, I added a condition to check if the current column is less than the target column, and then correctly handle tab characters to ensure the indentation is processed accurately. The function now updates the current indentation level properly, addressing the issue with incorrect indentation that was reported on GitHub.
