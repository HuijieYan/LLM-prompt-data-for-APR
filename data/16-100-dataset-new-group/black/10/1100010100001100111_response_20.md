The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect changes in the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is not handling tab characters correctly, which is causing the indentation to be incorrect.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions for tab characters and the management of the current_column variable.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling tab characters when calculating the current_column. This results in incorrect indentation when processing strings with tabs.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately handle tab characters and adjust the current_column accordingly. This can be done by checking for tab characters in the input prefix and updating the current_column by 4 for each tab encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes the handling of tab characters by updating the current_column value appropriately. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect changes in the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent.
