The bug in the function is that it incorrectly handles the 'wait_for_nl' flag, causing the function to not properly track the current column and append lines when encountering newline characters.

The 'wait_for_nl' flag is not correctly being set to True when encountering whitespace or tabs. As a result, the function does not correctly update the current column and append lines when a newline character is encountered.

To fix the bug, the 'wait_for_nl' flag should be set to True when encountering whitespace or tabs, and it should be set to False when encountering a non-whitespace character or a newline character.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':  # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the 'wait_for_nl' flag and update the current column and append lines when encountering newline characters.
