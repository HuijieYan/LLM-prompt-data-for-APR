The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely caused by incorrect handling of indentation during the parsing of the `prefix`. The function seems to be responsible for consuming the whitespace characters from the beginning of the `prefix` up to a specified `column` value.

The issue can be narrowed down to the logic checking for indentation level, which is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables. Additionally, the function fails to handle all scenarios involving tabs and spaces for indentation and newline characters effectively.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly consume and handle whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and newline characters until the specified `column` value within the `prefix`.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if current_column < column and (char == ' ' or char == '\t'):
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                else:  # char is tab
                    current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if wait_for_nl:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                current_line += char

        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version of the function should effectively handle all variations of indentation using spaces and tabs, and correctly consume the prefix up to the specified `column` value. After making these changes, the provided test cases should pass as expected.
