The potential error in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in the `wait_for_nl` condition and the handling of the `'\n'` character. It seems that when encountering a `'\n'` character, the code doesn't handle it properly, causing the issue.

The cause of the bug is that when a `'\n'` character is encountered, the function doesn't correctly reset the `current_line` and `current_column` variables. This leads to incorrect line concatenation and column tracking when creating the lines list.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic handling the `'\n'` character to correctly reset the state of the function when encountering a newline.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle newline characters correctly and produce the expected results for the failing test cases.
