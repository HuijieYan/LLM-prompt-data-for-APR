The buggy function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments in the prefix string. This results in incorrect output for some test cases. The issue is that the function is not properly tracking the indent level for comments and is not correctly preserving the original formatting.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't accurately handle the column position for comments and leading whitespace. The logic to track indentation using `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` is incorrect, and as a result, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix string, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the column position taking into account both spaces and tabs, and properly handle the formatting of comments when consuming the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # handle tab indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = current_line.lstrip()  # remove leading whitespace
            if current_line and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the indentation and formatting of comments in the prefix string, producing the expected output for the failing test cases.
