The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the indentation of comments after a dedent. This bug is likely causing the incorrect behavior described in the GitHub issue where the comments are being indented incorrectly.

From the analysis of the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we can see that the current_column and wait_for_nl variables are not being updated correctly in some cases, leading to incorrect indentation handling.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic of the _partially_consume_prefix function to ensure that the indentation is handled correctly for comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes a modified logic to update the current_column and wait_for_nl variables correctly based on the input prefix. This should address the indentation issue described in the GitHub issue.
