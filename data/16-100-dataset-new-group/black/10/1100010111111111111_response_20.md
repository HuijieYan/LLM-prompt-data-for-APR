The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is related to how it handles the indentation of comments. It appears that the function fails to correctly preserve the indentation of comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect formatting.

The function updates the current_column value based on the type of character encountered in the prefix. However, the logic for handling comments and preserving their indentation seems to be incorrect. This leads to the incorrect behavior when processing the input prefix.

The bug causes the failing test test_comment_indentation to produce incorrect output. As a result, the AssertionError is raised, indicating that the actual output does not match the expected output. The specific discrepancy occurs in the indentation of the comment in the reformatted code.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling comments and preserving their indentation should be revised. Additionally, the function should accurately track the current indentation level and apply the appropriate logic for preserving the correct indentation, especially after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4  # Adjust the column based on the type of character
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue with preserving the correct indentation of comments after a dedent. It accurately tracks the current indentation level and handles the logic for preserving indentation, ensuring that the test_comment_indentation test case passes as expected.
