The bug in the given function `_partially_consume_prefix` involves incorrect handling of whitespace and indentation-related characters. This leads to incorrect results when processing the input prefix and column values, which causes the failing tests.

The cause of the bug is primarily the mishandling of indentation and newline characters. The function is trying to identify and partially consume the prefix based on the given column, but it fails to correctly handle cases where the prefix contains indentation, spaces, or tabs.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the current position in the prefix and consume the characters accordingly, considering the indentation level and newline characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
