### Bug Fix Strategy
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation properly, leading to incorrect behavior when processing comments. The function is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly updates the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables based on the input prefix and column. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct lines are being appended to the `lines` list.

A corrected version of the function should handle the indentation properly, especially for tabulated comments after a dedent, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Update current_column for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                lines.append(current_line)  # Append the line before resetting
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function includes updates to properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent and ensure that the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables are updated correctly. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing tests.
