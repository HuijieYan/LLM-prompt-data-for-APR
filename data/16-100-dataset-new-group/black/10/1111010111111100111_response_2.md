## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8  # Changing the increment to 8 to match standard tab width
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the wait_for_nl flag for new line
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The bug is occurring because the function is not handling tab characters correctly. In Python, the standard tab width is considered as 8 spaces. Therefore, when encountering a tab character, the current_column needs to be incremented by 8 instead of 4. Additionally, the wait_for_nl flag should be reset to False when encountering a new line.

By making these adjustments, the function should correctly handle the indentation and formatting of tabulated comments after a dedent, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
