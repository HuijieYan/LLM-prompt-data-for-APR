The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent. This is leading to incorrect indentation for comments past depth 0.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. It fails to properly track the current column and wait for a newline character to reset the column count. This results in incorrect behavior when processing the prefix string and determining the correct line indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function accurately tracks the current column position and resets it when encountering a newline character.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    if char == '\t':
                        current_column += 4
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes additional logic to handle tab characters and correctly track the current column position. These changes should address the incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
