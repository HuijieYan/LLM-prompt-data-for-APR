To correct the buggy function, we will update the logic for appending lines and resetting the current line and column. We will also update the logic for handling tabs and spaces in the input prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char.isspace():
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values. It includes updated logic to handle spaces and tabs, correctly reset the current line and column, and append lines as necessary.
