The buggy function "_partially_consume_prefix" is part of the Driver class, and it is intended to process a prefix string and consume a portion of it based on the given column number.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The condition for checking if the current character is a newline character.
2. The condition for checking if the current character is a space or tab character.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a new line is not implemented correctly. This results in incorrect consumption of the prefix string and the failure to return the correct result.

To fix the bug, the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a new line needs to be adjusted to accurately consume the prefix string based on the given column number.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_column += 1
        else:
            break
    return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
```
