## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
1. The issue described in the GitHub report states that comments past depth 0 are incorrectly indented after a dedent in code using tabs.
2. The original function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not properly handle the indentation when consuming the prefix.
3. The buggy code fails to correctly determine the indentation level for lines with tabs, resulting in incorrect handling of comments after a dedent.
4. The corrected version of the function fixed the indentation level calculation for lines with tabs, ensuring that comments are correctly indented after a dedent.
5. The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
