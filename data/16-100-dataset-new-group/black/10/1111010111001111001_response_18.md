The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method is that it fails to correctly handle the indentation when encountering multiple consecutive tab or space characters. This bug leads to incorrect indentations, especially when consuming characters up to a specific column. The issue is primarily caused by the incorrect handling of the `current_column` variable and the logic for identifying when to wait for a new line.

To address this bug, a strategy for fixing this issue would involve modifying the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and new lines. Additionally, it's important to update the `current_column` count based on the tab or space characters encountered.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` method:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust column based on current position modulo 4
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the way tab characters are processed and adjusting the `current_column` value based on the position in the line, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle indentation and consume characters up to the specified column.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
