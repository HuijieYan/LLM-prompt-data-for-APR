The buggy function has several potential error locations. One issue is that the `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly updated. Also, the current line is being added to the `lines` list even if it does not meet the condition of having fewer columns than the specified `column` value. Additionally, there are issues with handling tab characters and unexpected empty lines.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly tracking the number of columns in each line and is not correctly handling the `wait_for_nl` condition.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the number of columns in each line and properly handle tab characters and unexpected empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with tracking column counts, handling tab characters, and unexpected empty lines. It resets the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags when necessary and properly adds lines to the `lines` list only when they meet the conditions specified.
