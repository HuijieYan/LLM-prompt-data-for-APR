The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the incorrect handling of tab and space characters, causing the incorrect behavior of comments indentation after a dedent. This seems to align with the GitHub issue description of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic of the function to properly handle tab and space characters and ensure that the indentation is correctly maintained for comments. Specifically, we need to update the logic for handling tab and space characters, as well as the wait_for_nl flag to control the indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # adjust column for tab
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version updates the handling of tab characters to adjust the column position accordingly. Additionally, it ensures that the wait_for_nl flag is properly controlled to maintain the correct indentation for comments.
