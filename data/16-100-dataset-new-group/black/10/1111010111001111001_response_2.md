The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not working as expected, leading to failing tests in the `test_comment_indentation` function. The root cause of the bug is that the implementation does not handle the logic for consuming the prefix string properly, resulting in incorrect `lines` and `current_line` values.

The logic inside the buggy function should correctly handle cases where the character is a space, tab, or newline, and update the line and column accordingly. However, it fails to properly track the column and line changes, resulting in incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic to update the `current_line` and `current_column` variables needs to be adjusted to accurately consume the prefix string. Additionally, the handling of `wait_for_nl` also needs to be optimized to represent the correct state of waiting for a new line.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_indent = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_indent:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_indent = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_indent = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with tracking the line and column as well as the state of waiting for indentation. When the failing tests are re-run with this corrected function, it should produce the expected results and pass all the test cases.
