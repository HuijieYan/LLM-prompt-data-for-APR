To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to address the incorrect handling of tab indentation for comments after a dedent. The bug is causing the code to incorrectly change the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The specific issue is related to the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function logic is not properly accounting for the indentation when processing tab characters and comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the tab and space indentation for comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the logic for handling tab characters, such that we adjust the `current_column` by 4 (assuming a tab width of 4 spaces). This adjustment ensures that the tab indentation is handled correctly for comments after a dedent.

With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
