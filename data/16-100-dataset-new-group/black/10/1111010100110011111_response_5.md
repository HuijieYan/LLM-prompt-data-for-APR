## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # change the number of spaces added from 4 to 8
                current_column += 8
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                # reset the current_column to 0
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The issue is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The cause of the bug is that when using tabs, the current_column is not correctly incremented when encountering a tab. To fix this, we need to change the number of spaces added for a tab character from 4 to 8, as tabs are considered as 8 spaces in Python's standard practice.

By making this change, the function should be able to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

After applying the fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
