The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The faulty function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be incorrectly handling the indentation of comments in the test cases when using tabs, causing the failing test.

The cause of the bug seems to be the mishandling of tab characters and newlines in the input prefix, resulting in incorrect indentation calculations.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle tab characters and newlines when calculating the indentation and formatting the lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            char = ' ' * (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Convert tabs to spaces
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly converts tab characters to spaces and updates the current column count accordingly, ensuring that the indentation is handled correctly for both spaces and tabs.

After implementing this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases and correctly handle the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.
