To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, we need to update the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a new line character. The current implementation does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. The logic for tracking the current indentation level is incorrect, leading to incorrect results when processing the prefix string.

A potential fix for the bug is to update the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a new line. We should also handle the cases where the input contains tabs for indentation. Additionally, we need to check for the presence of a non-empty line before adjusting the indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab equals 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the indentation and waiting for a new line character correctly. It accounts for both spaces and tabs as indentation, and it ensures that the comment indentation is adjusted accurately. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the function produce the expected output for the failing tests.
