The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly changing the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This bug is causing incorrect formatting when the input file uses tabs, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug lies within the function's logic for handling tab characters ('\t'). When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4, instead of aligning it to the next tab stop as per the tab size convention.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling tab characters to correctly align the `current_column` to the next tab stop.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_size = 4  # Set tab size to 4 for example, could be dynamically determined
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = tab_size - (current_column % tab_size)
            current_column += next_tab_stop
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling tab characters has been modified to correctly align the `current_column` to the next tab stop. This should resolve the issue with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
