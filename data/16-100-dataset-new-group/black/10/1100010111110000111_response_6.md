The issue with the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it incorrectly handles the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, resulting in failing the test `test_comment_indentation`. The specific error occurs when the function does not correctly determine the column for tabulated comments.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This can be achieved by properly tracking the column for tabulated comments and ensuring that they are indented correctly based on the input.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle tabulated comments after a dedent correctly and pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`. It resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent".
