The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The handling of tab characters using `'\t'` may be causing incorrect indentation, especially when mixed with spaces.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of tab characters and spaces in the input, leading to incorrect indentation after a dedent.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tab characters and spaces for determining the appropriate indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0  # Reset column count for new line
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

This corrected version of the function has been modified to handle tab characters and spaces correctly, ensuring that the indentation is calculated accurately. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
