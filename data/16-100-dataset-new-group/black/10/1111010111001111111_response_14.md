To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, we need to address the incorrect handling of tab characters and the logic for waiting for a new line (\n) after an indent. The function should correctly handle tab characters and keep track of the current indentation level to determine the correct line prefix.

The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters and the logic for waiting for a new line (\n) after an indent. The function does not properly update the current_column when encountering tab characters, and it does not correctly handle the wait_for_nl flag. This leads to incorrect behavior when processing the prefix string, causing incorrect indentation in the output.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for handling tab characters to correctly adjust the current_column and handle the wait_for_nl flag to track when a new line is expected after an indent. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained for the output lines.

Here is the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if not wait_for_nl:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True

            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = False
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_line += char
            if not wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function includes updated logic to handle tab characters, track the wait_for_nl flag, and maintain the correct indentation level for the output lines.

By using this corrected version of the function, the issue reported in the GitHub bug report should be resolved, and the failing test case should pass with the expected input/output values.
