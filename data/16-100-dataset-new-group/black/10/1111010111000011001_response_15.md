The issue with the current implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle indentation and new lines when processing the prefix string. This leads to incorrect behavior when dealing with comment indentation, which is reflected in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation and new lines within the `prefix` string. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and not char.isspace():
            wait_for_nl = False
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now be able to correctly handle the indentation and new lines within the `prefix` string and pass the failing test.
