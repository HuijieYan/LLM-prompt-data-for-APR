The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function fails to handle the indentation of comments properly when the input file uses tabs, resulting in incorrect formatting.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of indentation and new lines within the `prefix` string. The function fails to account for the indentation level and incorrectly handles the wait_for_nl flag, resulting in the wrong indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation and new lines within the `prefix` string, ensuring that comments are properly aligned based on the indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
   
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                if (current_column + 4) <= column:
                    current_column += 4
                    current_line += char
                else:
                    current_line += ' ' * (column - current_column)
                    current_column = column
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation and new lines correctly to ensure that the comments are aligned based on the specified column. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
