### Analysis:
The error message is related to "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent". The failing test is related to formatting code with comments and how the indentation is handled.

### Potential error locations:
The issue seems to be related to how the function `_partially_consume_prefix` handles indentation and comments. The function may not be correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs. This likely leads to incorrect formatting of the comments, as seen in the error message from the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs. The function should ensure that the comments are indented the same way as the next line after a dedent, regardless of whether tabs or spaces are used for indentation.

### Corrected version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if not current_line.strip(): # Added condition to handle comments after dedent
                lines.append(current_line) # Append the current line before a space
                current_line = ""
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if not current_line.strip(): # Added condition to handle comments after dedent
                lines.append(current_line) # Append the current line before a tab
                current_line = ""
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes conditions to handle comments after a dedent by ensuring that the comments are indented correctly based on the next line. This should resolve the issue and make the function handle the indentation of comments after a dedent more accurately.
