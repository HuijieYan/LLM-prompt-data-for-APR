To correct the buggy function, we need to address the logic for handling the indentation. From the failing test and the runtime values, it is clear that the buggy function is not correctly handling the indentation and adding extra spaces. 

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `indent` and `comment` in the input. The `wait_for_nl` flag should be toggled when the current line is at a certain level of indentation. Also, it should correctly concatenate the lines and exit from the loop when a newline character is encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic to handle indentation and newline characters has been updated, and the new line is correctly constructed and separated based on indentation levels. This function should now pass the failing test scenario described previously.
