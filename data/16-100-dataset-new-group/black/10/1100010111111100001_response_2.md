The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the handling of whitespace characters, particularly tabs and spaces, within the `prefix` input. The function fails to correctly consume the prefix and return the remaining string, which causes the failing test.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect logic for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation and new lines, resulting in the function failing to return the expected string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl`. We should correctly handle space, tab, and new line characters when updating the `current_column` and setting `wait_for_nl` to `True`. Additionally, we should update the 'lines' list correctly to keep track of lines in the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly handle the input prefixes and return the remaining string. This should resolve the failing test.
