Based on the runtime values and types of variables and the expected values and types of variables, the bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. This leads to the incorrect formatting of comments when using tabs in the input file.

To fix this bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to correctly handle the indentation and alignment of comments after a dedent, especially for input files that use tabs for indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column//4 + 1)*4  # Handle tab indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Include the current line in the lines list
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    lines.append(current_line)  # Include the current line in the lines list
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

The changes in the corrected version of the function include correctly handling the tab indentation and making sure the current line is included in the `lines` list before resetting it.

By using this corrected version of the function, the issue with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent should be resolved, and the failing tests should pass.
