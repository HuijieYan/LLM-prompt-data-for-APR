The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value, which is identified by specific characters within the prefix. The function tracks the current line, column position, and whether it is waiting for a new line. However, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation level for comments after a dedent, as indicated by the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and the GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The bug in the function lies in the logic that handles the indentation level and waiting for a new line when processing the prefix. Specifically, when encountering a space, the function increments the column by 1, but when encountering a tab, it increments the column by 4. However, when waiting for a new line, the logic does not adequately handle the indentation for comments, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation and waiting for a new line needs to be adjusted. Additionally, the function should correctly handle the indentation level for comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the indentation and waiting for a new line, ensuring that the prefix is partially consumed based on the specified column value.

This corrected version of the function should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, providing the expected behavior for the given input scenarios.
