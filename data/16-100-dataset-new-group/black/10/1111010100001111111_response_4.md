To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to update the logic for handling indentation and newline characters. The bug is causing incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent.

The main issue is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters, which is leading to incorrect output for tabulated comments. We can see from the runtime values and expected values that the function is not appropriately adjusting the indentation levels and handling newline characters.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic to properly track the column and handle the different types of characters (spaces, tabs, newline) to ensure that the output maintains the correct indentation structure.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_line += char
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, current_line
```

With this corrected version, we have updated the logic to properly handle the indentation levels and newline characters. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the function produces the expected output for different input cases.
