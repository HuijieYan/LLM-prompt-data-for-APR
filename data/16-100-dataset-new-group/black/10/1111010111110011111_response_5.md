The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior when handling comments with different levels of indentation. This is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to produce an AssertionError, as the expected and actual values do not match.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments in the input code, leading to incorrect output. This is resulting in the failing test case. The function should properly handle tabulated comments and maintain the correct indentation level.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments and ensure that the output matches the expected indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust the indentation level for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add the current line to the list of lines
            current_line = ""  # Reset the current line
            current_column = 0  # Reset the current column
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    lines.append(current_line)  # Add the last line to the list of lines
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle the indentation of comments and ensure that the output matches the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
