The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a few issues. One of the main issues is with the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables. The logic is not accurately updating the state of the function as it reads through the `prefix`. Another issue is the conditional check for `current_column < column` which is not handling the whitespace characters correctly.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` needs to be revised, and the conditional check for `current_column < column` should be adjusted to handle whitespace characters as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle the input/output values correctly according to the given test cases.
