To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to address the incorrect handling of indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The bug causes the incorrect transformation of tabulated comments after a dedent when using the Black library.

The strategy to fix this bug involves modifying the logic for handling tabulated comments and their indentation level. Specifically, we need to ensure that the indentation for tabulated comments is maintained correctly after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':  # Adjust the handling of tab characters
                if current_column % 4 == 0:  # Align to next multiple of 4
                    current_column += 4
                else:  # Calculate the remaining spaces needed for alignment to next multiple of 4
                    current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have adjusted the logic for handling tab characters ('\t') to ensure that the indentation level for tabulated comments is maintained correctly after a dedent. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report regarding incorrect indentation for tabulated comments.
