To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to address the incorrect handling of indentation when processing prefix lines with comments. The issue seems to stem from incorrect tracking of the current indentation level and the handling of different types of whitespace characters.

The bug causes the comments to be incorrectly indented after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs for indentation.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for tracking the current indentation level and correctly handle different types of whitespace characters (e.g., tabs and spaces). We also need to ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the code after dedents.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                # Check if the current line contains a comment
                if '#' in current_line:
                    comment_index = current_line.index('#')
                    comment_column = current_column + (comment_index - len(current_line))
                    if comment_column < column:
                        # Adjust the indentation of the comment
                        current_line = current_line[:comment_index] + " " * (column - comment_column) + current_line[comment_index:]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            # Handle other characters if necessary
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the logic to correctly track the current indentation level and handle the comment indentation based on the specified column. It should now pass the failing test for comment indentation. This update also addresses the issue reported on GitHub where indentation for comments was incorrectly changed after a dedent, especially when using tabs for indentation.
