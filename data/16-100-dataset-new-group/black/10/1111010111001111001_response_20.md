The bug is likely in the section of code responsible for reversing and returning the result. The function is supposed to partially consume the prefix based on the given column, but it seems to be missing the handling for iterating through characters and updating the variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` appropriately.

To fix the bug, we should update the variable `lines` and `current_line` as we iterate through the characters based on the column and handle the cases for space, tab, and newline characters properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now properly handle the indentation level and consume the prefix according to the given column. It should pass the failing test cases provided.
