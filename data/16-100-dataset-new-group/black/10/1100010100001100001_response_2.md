The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect behavior when trying to consume a prefix based on a given column value. The bug is likely due to the incorrect indentation and handling of newline characters.

One potential fix for this bug would be to update the logic for handling white space and newline characters within the prefix. Specifically, we should ensure that the current column count is being updated correctly and reset when a newline character is encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
This corrected function fixes the bug by correctly updating the current column count when encountering white space characters and correctly handling the newline characters. As a result, the function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the given column value.
