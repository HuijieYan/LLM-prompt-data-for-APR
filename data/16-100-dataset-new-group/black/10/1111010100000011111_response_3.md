                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column + 4) // 4 * 4  # Adjust current_column for tab width
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation and strategy for fixing the bug
The bug in the original function is caused by the mismanagement of the `current_column` variable in response to tab characters. Tabs are being counted as only 1 column instead of 4 as intended. To fix this, we will adjust the `current_column` incrementation for tab characters to ensure that the correct column count is maintained.

By updating the incremental logic for tab characters, we can ensure that the correct column count is maintained. This will address the issue described in the GitHub report where the indentation for comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

The corrected function above incorporates the adjusted logic for tab characters, ensuring that the column count is accurately maintained. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
