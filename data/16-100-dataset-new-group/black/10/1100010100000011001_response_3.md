The buggy function fails to correctly handle the expected input due to incorrect logic and variable manipulation. The `wait_for_nl` flag is used to determine whether to wait for a new line character before processing the current line. However, this flag is set to False only when encountering space or tab characters, which is inconsistent with the intended logic. Additionally, the calculation of the current column position is incorrect, resulting in inaccurate tracking of the position within the prefix string.

To fix these issues, the following corrected version of the function is provided:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction updates the logic to correctly set the `wait_for_nl` flag when a space or tab character is encountered, and adjusts the calculation of the `current_column` variable accordingly. These changes should ensure that the function correctly handles the expected input and returns the intended output in all the given test cases.
