The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with its logic for handling whitespace and newlines. It fails to correctly identify and handle indentation changes when encountering whitespace and newlines in the input `prefix`.

The `wait_for_nl` flag is not toggled correctly, leading to incorrect handling of the current line and column.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle changes in indentation level when encountering whitespace and newlines. This leads to incorrect splitting of the `prefix` string and incorrect determination of the prefix to be consumed.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the current line and column position, account for changes in indentation, and properly handle newline characters.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            while current_column < column:
                current_line += ' '
                current_column += 1
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issues with determining the correct prefix to be consumed and should pass the failing test cases.
