The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is caused by incorrect behavior when the function is supposed to consume the specified number of characters and then return the remaining characters in the prefix. It fails to correctly handle the case where the remaining characters are less than the required number of characters defined by the column. This is due to the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` not being met in such cases.

To fix this bug, the logic for checking whether the remaining characters are less than the required number of characters based on the column needs to be revised. Additionally, the logic for handling different characters and their impact on the current column value needs to be updated.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Updated condition to check if current_column is less than or equal to column
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these updates, the function should now correctly consume the specified number of characters based on the column and return the remaining characters in the prefix.
