### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the indentation and handling of tabs in the input code. Specifically, the issue occurs when a comment is present after a dedent with tabs. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation of these comments. To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic for handling tabs and comments when parsing the input prefix.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjusting the column for tabs
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    # Add the last line after the loop
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

In the corrected version, I have adjusted the handling of tabs by incrementing the `current_column` by 4 for each tab encountered. Additionally, I have placed the last line of the prefix into the `lines` list after the loop, and I'm returning an empty string for the remaining prefix. This should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent with tabs.
