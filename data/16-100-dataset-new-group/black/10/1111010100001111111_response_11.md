The problem seems to be related to the incorrect handling of comments with tabs and spaces in the input file. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume part of a prefix string up to a certain column, handling indentation with spaces and tabs. However, it seems to be mishandling the indentation when encountering tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the tab characters and their impact on the current_column count. This results in incorrect indentation processing, especially when mixing tabs and spaces.

To fix this bug, the function should accurately count the column position taking into account both tabs and spaces, and correctly handle the indentation levels when consuming the input prefix string.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += next_tab_stop
            current_line += " " * next_tab_stop
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 3
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have added logic to handle tab characters correctly and update the current_column count accordingly. We also adjusted the column count for spaces to align with the tab logic. This should resolve the issue with incorrect indentation processing.
