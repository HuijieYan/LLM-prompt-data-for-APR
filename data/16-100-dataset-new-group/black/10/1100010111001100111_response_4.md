The issue is related to the incorrect behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function in handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. Based on the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the buggy function is not properly handling the indentation of comments, resulting in incorrect output.

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic for handling indentation and newline characters.

The cause of the bug is that the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being properly reset when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect handling of comment indentation after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset when encountering a newline character and that the comment indentation is adjusted correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # Reset the flag for non-indent characters
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This version resets the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline character and also handles the indentation of comments after a dedent correctly.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
