The cause of the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is that the indentation level is incremented incorrectly when processing tab characters. This leads to incorrect indentation when dealing with comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling tab characters to correctly update the current_column value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_next_tab = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_next_tab
            current_column += spaces_to_next_tab
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1 if char != '\n' else -current_column
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles tabs, updates the current_column value correctly, and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
