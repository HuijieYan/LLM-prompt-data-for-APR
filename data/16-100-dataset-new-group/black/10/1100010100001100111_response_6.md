The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to incorrect handling of tabs and spaces when determining the current column while iterating through the prefix string.

It appears that the function is not properly updating the `current_column` value when encountering tabs or newlines. This is leading to incorrect calculations of the current indentation level and causing issues with the comments' indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is updated correctly when encountering tabs or newlines. We also need to handle cases where the prefix string ends without encountering a newline.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust current_column based on the number of spaces a tab represents
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate the number of spaces needed to reach the next tab stop
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added a calculation to adjust the `current_column` value when encountering tabs. This should ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation level when using tabs, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
