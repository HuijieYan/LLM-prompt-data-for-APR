To fix the indentation issue, we need to correct the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It seems that the issue is related to how the function handles tab characters and indentation levels, especially when encountering comments.

Based on the failing tests and the expected input/output values, we can identify that the function is not correctly handling the indentation levels for comments, leading to incorrect output. The function should correctly track the current column and handle the indentation based on tab characters and spaces.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to accurately compute the expected indentation for comments. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function handles both tab characters and spaces consistently to maintain the correct indentation levels.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the column based on the tab width, e.g., 4 spaces
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly handle the indentation for comments and maintain the expected output for the failing tests. This fix also addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
