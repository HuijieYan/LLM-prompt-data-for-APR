The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by the incorrect logic for tracking the current column position and identifying when to wait for a newline character. This results in incorrect line splitting and prefix handling when processing input strings with indentation.

To fix the bug, the conditions for updating the current column and waiting for a newline character should be adjusted according to the indentation levels. Also, the logic for appending the current line to the lines array needs to be updated to ensure correct line splitting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle input strings with varying indentation levels, split the lines properly, and return the expected prefix consumption results.
