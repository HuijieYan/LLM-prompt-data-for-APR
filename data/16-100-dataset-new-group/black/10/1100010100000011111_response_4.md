The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be part of the code formatter Black, and it is being used in the context of indentation handling. It appears that the function is incorrectly handling indentation for comments after a dedent, similar to the issue reported on GitHub.

The potential error locations in the function could be related to the logic for handling indentation, especially the management of `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. Given the GitHub issue report, it seems that the function is not correctly preserving the original indentation of comments, especially when the input file uses tabs for indentation. This is due to the incorrect calculation of `current_column` and the handling of tab characters.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles tab characters for indentation and preserves the original formatting, especially for comments after a dedent.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I have made adjustments to the handling of tab characters by increasing `current_column` by 4 for each tab encountered. I also made sure to append the current line to the `lines` list when a newline character is encountered, preserving the original formatting.

This corrected version of the function should address the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values for the specified test cases.
