## The bug
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly indent lines when consuming the prefix. This results in incorrect output when comparing the expected result to the actual result.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the whitespace, such as tabs and spaces, in the prefix. As a result, it incorrectly calculates the length of the lines when dealing with different indentation levels.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to accurately count the indentation based on tabs and spaces. It should correctly handle new lines and preserve the indentation level when returning the consumed prefix.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            if current_column <= column:  # Check if the current column is within the specified column
                lines.append(current_line)
                prefix = prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]  # Remove consumed prefix from the original
                return ''.join(lines), prefix
        return ''.join(lines), prefix
```

With the corrected `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the failing tests should now produce the expected output.
