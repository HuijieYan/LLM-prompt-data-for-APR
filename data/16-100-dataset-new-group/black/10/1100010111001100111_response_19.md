The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely causing the indentation issue for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation and newline characters, leading to incorrect behavior in the test cases.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables inside the function, we can see that the function is not correctly handling the indentation calculation and the waiting for a new line character.

The cause of the bug can be traced to the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition and the logic for updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables. This is likely resulting in incorrect calculation of the indentation level and incorrect slicing of the prefix input.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the current indentation level and handle the waiting for a new line character in a more robust way.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            continue
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the prefix string and calculate the correct indentation level, which will address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test cases pass.
