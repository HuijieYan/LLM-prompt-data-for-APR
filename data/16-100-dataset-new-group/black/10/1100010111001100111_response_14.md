The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume and return a prefix string until a specific column, taking into account indentation and new lines. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect behavior of handling the indentation for comments after a dedent.

The potential error in the function can be related to the handling of indentation and new lines, especially when encountering comments after a dedent.

Looking at the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and the runtime input/output values for the function, it can be observed that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation and new lines for comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect indentation for comments following a dedent, especially when mixed with different indentation styles, such as tabs and spaces.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation and new lines for comments after a dedent, ensuring that the output maintains the correct indentation as per the input code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                lines.append(prefix[len(''.join(lines)):])
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            current_column = column + 1
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function has been modified to handle the indentation and new lines correctly, ensuring that the output maintains the correct indentation as per the input code. This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
