The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. The function has issues with correctly tracking the lines and columns of the prefix string, which causes it to return incorrect results.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for handling whitespace and newline characters, as well as the management of the `wait_for_nl` flag.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly track the column position and handle the newline characters, leading to incorrect partial consumption of the prefix string.

To fix the bug, the function should be rewritten to properly handle whitespace and newline characters, while accurately tracking the column position.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the prefix string correctly and pass the failing test.
