To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to make adjustments to how the lines are processed when encountering a comment. The current logic fails to handle the correct indentation when encountering comments.

The issue is that the function incorrectly handles the indentation for comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect indentation for comments when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling comments and their indentation. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                # adjust indentation for comment
                diff = current_column - len(current_line.lstrip())
                if diff > 0:
                    current_line = ' ' * (current_column - diff) + current_line.lstrip()
                    current_column -= diff
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to adjust the comment's indentation if it doesn't match the current indentation level after encountering a newline. This ensures that the comment indentation is correctly handled, addressing the bug identified.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the indentation issue for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs, as described in the GitHub issue.
