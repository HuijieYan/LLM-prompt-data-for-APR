The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix string based on a specified column value. However, it incorrectly handles the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements that check for spaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect output. This is evident in the failing test cases, as the expected values are not being produced.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle the indentation of tabulated comments. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for handling tab characters and newlines, as well as updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
