The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle the indentation of comments correctly. This causes the incorrect reformatting of comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments. Specifically, the function should correctly identify and handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, ensuring that the comments are formatted as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the indentation of comments correctly and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
