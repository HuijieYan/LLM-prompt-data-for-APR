The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix according to a given column. However, it is failing to correctly store and return the consumed prefix.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation levels and line breaks within the prefix, resulting in incorrect consumption of characters. This leads to the incorrect returned value, as well as the failure of the `test_comment_indentation` test case.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately track the indentation levels and handle line breaks, spaces, and tabs appropriately to ensure correct consumption of the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now accurately track the indentation and handle line breaks, spaces, and tabs, ensuring correct consumption of the prefix and a successful test case execution.
