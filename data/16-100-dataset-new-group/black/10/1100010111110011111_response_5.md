## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                else:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I modified the condition within the loop to handle indentation and comments correctly. I also adjusted the way the column count is updated when encountering a tab character. This should resolve the issue with incorrectly changing the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The changes made include using `len(current_line.expandtabs())` to correctly calculate the length of the line taking into account the expanded tab positions, and adjusting the column count for tab characters in the `elif char == '\t'` section.

These changes ensure that the behavior of the function aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
