The issue with the current implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation levels, especially when processing comments in the prefix string.

In the failing test, the function fails to properly format the prefix string, resulting in an incorrect indentation level for comments.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Introduce a variable to keep track of the current indentation level and ensure that the function correctly handles the different types of indentation characters (spaces, tabs).
2. Modify the logic of the function to correctly identify the indentation level and handle the comments at the expected column.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        current_indentation = 0  # New variable to track indentation level
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_indentation += 1
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_indentation += 4
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_indentation = 0
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Check if the current indentation level matches the expected column
                if current_column < column and current_indentation >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the updated logic and the addition of the `current_indentation` variable, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and process comments at the expected column.

After making these changes, re-run the failing test to ensure that the corrected version of the function now passes the test.
