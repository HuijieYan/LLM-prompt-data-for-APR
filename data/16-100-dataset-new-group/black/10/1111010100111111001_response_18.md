The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it fails to properly handle scenarios where the prefix contains tabs, spaces, or new lines. 

In particular, the issue arises when the `column` of the current line is greater than the specified `column` parameter. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies and handles scenarios where the prefix contains tabs, spaces, or new lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should handle scenarios with tabs, spaces, and new lines in the prefix, and accurately return the expected results based on the specified column.
