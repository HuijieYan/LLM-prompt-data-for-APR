The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to consume a prefix string and return a tuple containing the consumed part of the prefix and the remaining unparsed part of the prefix based on the given `column`. However, there are a few issues in the function that are causing it to behave incorrectly.

### Issues:
1. The condition for checking if the `wait_for_nl` flag is set needs to be moved outside of the loop that iterates through the characters in the `prefix`.
2. The condition for checking `current_column < column` is incorrectly placed.
3. The logic for handling tabs `'\t'` is inconsistent.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Move the check for `wait_for_nl` outside of the loop so that it only gets checked once all characters have been processed.
2. Move the current column check inside the loop to correctly determine when to return the consumed prefix.
3. Adjust the logic for handling tabs to correctly increment the `current_column`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces
            current_line += ' ' * spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line = char + prefix[prefix.index(char)+1:]
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
