The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation of comments correctly, which is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to produce an incorrect result, leading to an assertion error.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements related to handling whitespace characters, such as spaces, tabs, and newlines.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly tracking the column number and waiting for newline characters when encountering indented comments, leading to incorrect splitting of the input prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation of comments and accurately tracks the column number when encountering different types of whitespace characters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have adjusted the handling of tabs to ensure that the `current_column` is properly incremented by a suitable amount based on the current column position. This modification will address the incorrect splitting of the input prefix and resolve the failing test.

By using this corrected version of the function, the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent should also be addressed.
