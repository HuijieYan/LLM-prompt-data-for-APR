The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be a part of the black formatter and is located in the file `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`. It seems that this function is responsible for consuming the prefix of a string at a certain column, while preserving the indentation level.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the formatter when dealing with comments at different indentation levels. The error message indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output for the given input.

The GitHub issue provides more context about the problem, stating that the indentation of comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent, especially when using tabs in the input file.

After analyzing the code, test, and GitHub issue, it appears that the bug may be related to how the function handles the indentation level when encountering comments.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be updated to correctly handle the indentation when encountering comments, especially after dedents. The logic for consuming prefix, counting columns, and handling different types of whitespace needs to be revisited to ensure the correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the column count based on the number of spaces represented by the tab
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making adjustments to the handling of tab characters and updating the column count accordingly, the corrected function should now properly consume the prefix while preserving the correct indentation levels.

This updated version should address the bug related to changing the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent when using the black formatter.
