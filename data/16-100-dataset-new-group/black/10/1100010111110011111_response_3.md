The potential error locations within the buggy function include the logic for updating the current_column variable and the conditions for appending lines to the list.

The cause of the bug is that the current_column variable is not being updated correctly, and the logic for handling indentation and waiting for a new line is not functioning as expected. This results in incorrect handling of the indentation and waiting for the newline character, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating current_column and handling the indentation and newline characters needs to be adjusted. Additionally, the logic for appending lines to the list should be reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this corrected version, the function handles the indentation, updating the current column, and managing the newline character correctly.

This should address the reported issue on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output values.
