The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is likely causing the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent. The function is not properly handling tabs and identifying the correct column number, which results in incorrect indentation.

Potential error locations:
- The logic for handling tabs and spaces is not accurate, leading to incorrect column calculations.
- The condition for checking if wait_for_nl is True is not properly handled.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing incorrect handling of tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect column calculation. This results in the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling tabs and spaces to accurately calculate the column number.
2. Ensure that the wait_for_nl condition is properly handled to capture the correct indentation.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
        current_line += char
        if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function handles tabs and spaces accurately to calculate the column number and properly manages the wait_for_nl condition to capture the correct indentation. This should resolve the reported GitHub issue.
