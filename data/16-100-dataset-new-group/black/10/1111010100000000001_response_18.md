The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix and split it at a specified column. The potential error locations within the function are in the logic for handling tabs (`\t`) and newlines (`\n`).

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case when the column is reached before encountering a newline. This causes the function to incorrectly split the prefix.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle the cases where the column is reached before a newline. We can keep track of the column count and check it against the specified column to determine when to split the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # adjust column count for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:  # check if column is reached
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function properly handles the cases where the specified column is reached before encountering a newline, effectively splitting the prefix at the correct location.
