The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a specific column, based on indentation and line breaks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The logic for handling indentation and line breaks.
2. The condition for checking if the current line is empty.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle cases where the current line is empty or when reaching the specified column.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling indentation and line breaks to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix string up to the specified column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_column += 1
        else:
            break
    
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

```

In this corrected version, we modified the logic to accurately track the current column count and handle line breaks as well as indentation. The function now iterates over each character in the prefix and appends it to the current line until the specified column is reached. Then, it returns the consumed portion of the prefix and the remaining prefix.
