The bug occurs in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` of the `Driver` class. The function is intended to consume a portion of the prefix until it reaches a certain column, and then return the consumed portion along with the remaining prefix. However, the function fails to handle tab characters correctly, which can cause incorrect indentation.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of tab characters in the `prefix`. The function does not accurately account for the indentation caused by tab characters, resulting in incorrect column calculations and unexpected behavior, especially in cases where the input uses tabs instead of spaces.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle tab characters properly and accurately calculate the column position. One approach could be to replace each tab character with the appropriate number of spaces based on the tab width before processing the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        expanded_prefix = prefix.expandtabs(4)  # Replace tabs with spaces based on tab width
        for char in expanded_prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we use the `expandtabs` method to replace tab characters in the prefix with the appropriate number of spaces based on the tab width (assumed to be 4 in this case). This ensures that the column position is calculated correctly, addressing the buggy behavior caused by the mishandling of tab characters.

This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function correctly handles tabulated comments after a dedent.
