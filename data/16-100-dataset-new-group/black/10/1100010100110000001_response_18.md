The bug in the provided function is causing an indentation error in the output. The error message shows that the indentation for the comment is incorrect, leading to a failing test.

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation and newline characters properly, which is causing incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the indentation and newline characters so that the output matches the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = False
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function properly handles the indentation and newline characters, ensuring that the output matches the expected format. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
