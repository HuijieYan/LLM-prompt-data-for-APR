## Analysis:
The _partially_consume_prefix function takes in a prefix and a column number, and then iterates through the prefix, incrementing the current_column based on spaces and tabs encountered. If it encounters a newline character, it resets the current_column. If it encounters a non-space/tab character, it sets wait_for_nl to True. If wait_for_nl is True and it encounters a newline character, it checks if the current_line is non-empty and the current_column is less than the specified column, and then returns the result.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of the wait_for_nl condition.
2. Handling of the newline character.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character while wait_for_nl is True. The current_line is not being properly appended to the lines list in this condition.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
Ensure that the current_line is appended to the lines list when wait_for_nl is True and a newline character is encountered.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
