To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that the indentation for comments is correctly handled, especially after a dedent. Based on the failing test and the provided input/output variable values, it seems that the bug is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.

It appears that the current implementation of `_partially_consume_prefix` does not accurately handle the indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. This leads to incorrect reformatting of the comments, as observed in the failing test and mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used in the input file.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling tab indentation has been updated to ensure that the correct tab width is accounted for. This should address the issue with incorrect reformatting of comments after a dedent when tabs are used in the input file.

With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue reported in GitHub regarding the incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.
