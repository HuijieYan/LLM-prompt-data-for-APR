The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to handle indentation and newline characters in a given prefix string. However, it fails in scenarios where there is an indentation followed by a comment.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` when encountering a character different from space, tab, or newline. This causes the function to incorrectly treat the comment as part of the indentation and leads to incorrect processing.

To fix the bug, we need to redefine the logic for handling indentation and newline characters. We should reset `wait_for_nl` and adjust the handling of indentation to correctly identify when an indentation block ends, allowing the comment to be properly processed.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 4) // 4 * 4  # adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    # handle case where prefix ends without a newline
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    lines.append(current_line)

    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass.
