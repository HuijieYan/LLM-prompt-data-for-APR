The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a given prefix string while keeping track of the current line and column positions. The function has a logic error in handling the wait_for_nl condition and updating the lines list, resulting in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent in some scenarios.

The cause of the logic error can be observed from the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and the corresponding error message, which indicates that comments are not correctly indented. The runtime input/output variable values also show that the function is not handling the wait_for_nl condition and updating the lines list properly.

To fix the bug, a suggested strategy is to refactor the logic for handling the wait_for_nl condition and updating the lines list inside the for loop, ensuring that the correct behavior is maintained for different indentation scenarios and special characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By refactoring the logic to handle different characters and indentation scenarios, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
