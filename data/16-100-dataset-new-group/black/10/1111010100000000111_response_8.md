The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic related to handling tab characters and determining the column indentation. It is likely causing the indentation to be incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The bug is likely caused by the mishandling of tab characters in the input prefix, which leads to incorrect column calculations and the inconsistency in the output indentation.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to properly handle tab characters and ensure the correct calculation of the column indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - current_column % 4)
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 3  # assuming 4 spaces per tab
            wait_for_nl = True if char != ' ' else False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function properly handles tab characters by adjusting the column indentation based on the tab width. It also ensures correct handling of spaces and newline characters. This should resolve the issue of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
