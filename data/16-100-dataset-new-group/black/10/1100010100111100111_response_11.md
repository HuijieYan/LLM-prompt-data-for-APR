### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation and newline characters when partially consuming the input prefix. This is leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent in the failing test cases. The function should correctly handle the indentation and newline characters within the prefix to ensure proper consumption.

### Bug Cause
The bug appears to be caused by incorrect handling of indentation and newline characters within the prefix. The function does not account for the correct indentation level when consuming characters, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the cases where indentation and newline characters are encountered. Additionally, the function should correctly calculate the remaining prefix after consumption to ensure that the output prefix is accurately represented.

### Bug Fix
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
With this fix, the function now correctly handles the indentation and newline characters, ensuring that the output prefix is properly represented.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the function correctly consumes the input prefix.
