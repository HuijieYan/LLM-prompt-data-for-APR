The buggy function is partially consuming the prefix and not correctly handling the indentation. This results in incorrect prefixes being returned, causing the failing test cases. The function is also not correctly updating the `lines` and `current_line` variables, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should:
1. Properly handle the indentation and line breaks.
2. Update the `lines` and `current_line` variables for each character in the prefix.
3. Return the correct result by joining the lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column and not char.isspace():
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
