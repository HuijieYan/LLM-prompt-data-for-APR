## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
1. Analysis: The buggy function is attempting to partially consume a prefix based on indentation and newlines.

2. Error locations: The if condition checking for '\t' needs to be modified as well as the handling of tab characters to ensure proper indentation processing.

3. Cause of the bug: The buggy function fails to correctly handle tab characters which results in incorrect indentation for comments.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug: Modify the if condition for tab characters to handle tab indentation correctly by considering the current column and update the current_column for tab characters.

5. Given the corrected version of the function above, it handles tab characters correctly and will pass the failing test, thus resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
