The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic issue that is causing the indentation to be incorrectly managed, leading to failing tests and an issue on GitHub.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrectly handling the indentation level when processing comments after a dedent.
2. Conditional logic for handling newline characters and indentation levels.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly track the current line's column, resulting in the incorrect handling of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, the logic for tracking the current column and handling comments after a dedent needs to be revised. Conditional statements for handling different characters should also be reviewed.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            if char in [' ', '\t']:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By revising the logic to handle different characters, this corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing tests. It will also resolve the indentation problem reported in the GitHub issue.
