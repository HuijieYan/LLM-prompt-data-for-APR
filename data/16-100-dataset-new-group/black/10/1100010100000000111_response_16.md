1. The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix is responsible for handling the indentation of comments in the code. It seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, which aligns with the GitHub issue reported.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
- The logic for handling tab characters (\t) and incrementing the current_column variable
- The logic for detecting and handling the end of the indentation

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling tabulated comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect indentation when using tabs in the input file and running the Black formatter.

4. To fix the bug, the function logic for handling tabs and detecting the end of the indentation needs to be reviewed and modified to properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces is the equivalent of 1 tab
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line or end of the line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl flag
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling tab characters (\t) has been modified to increment the current_column variable by 4, assuming that 4 spaces is the equivalent of 1 tab. Additionally, the handling of the end of the indentation has been adjusted to reset the wait_for_nl flag when encountering a new line or the end of the line.
