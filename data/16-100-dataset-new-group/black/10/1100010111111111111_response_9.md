The issue seems to be related to the indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs in the input file. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely causing the indentation issue. After analyzing the runtime and expected input/output values, it appears that the function is not handling the indentation and newline characters correctly. The function is not capturing the indentation and newline characters and their associated column values accurately, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters, space characters, and newline characters, and accurately calculate the column index for proper indentation. It also needs to correctly detect when a comment is waiting for a newline and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust the column index for tabs
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
            if not wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function addresses the issues related to indentation calculation and newline handling. It should now accurately process the input prefix and handle comments and indentation properly. This corrected version should resolve the indentation issue reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test cases.
