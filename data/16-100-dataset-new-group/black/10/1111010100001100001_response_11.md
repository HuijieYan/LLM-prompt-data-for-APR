The bug in the function is causing it to not return the correct result in all cases.

The issue seems to be with the handling of indentation. The function is supposed to partially consume the prefix string based on the given column value, but it is not properly accounting for the indentation levels.

In the provided cases, it can be seen that the current_column value is not being updated correctly, and the wait_for_nl flag is not being reset at the appropriate times.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to properly track the current indentation level and update the current_column value accordingly. Additionally, the wait_for_nl flag should be reset once a new line is encountered.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, I have added an `else` block to properly handle the indentation, and made sure to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag and update the `current_column` value as needed.
