Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the indentation of comments being incorrectly changed after a dedent when using tabs in the input file. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely responsible for this issue. The function seems to handle the prefix of a string, but it fails to handle tab characters correctly, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle tab characters and maintain the correct indentation for comments.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles tab characters and adjusts the current column based on the tab character encountered. It also maintains the correct indentation for comments after a dedent.

By implementing this corrected version, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
