## Corrected Version

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.lstrip('\t ') and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
1. The issue on GitHub describes an incorrect behavior with indentation for comments after a dedent. This aligns with the failure of the `test_comment_indentation` test function, where incorrect indentation is observed for tabulated comments.
2. The potential error location is in the condition `if current_line.strip()` in the original ` _partially_consume_prefix` function, which does not properly check for the presence of non-space characters (including tab characters) in the current line.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters in the function, which leads to incorrect indentation when dealing with comments after a dedent. The failing test further confirms the issue by showing the incorrect output for tabulated comments.
4. The buggy function should correctly handle tab characters and space characters to determine the indentation of the comment. Additionally, the condition for checking non-space characters in the current line should be adjusted.
5. The corrected version of the function has been updated to check for non-space characters, including tab characters, and correctly determine the indentation level for comments after a dedent. This should address the issue and make the function behave as expected.
