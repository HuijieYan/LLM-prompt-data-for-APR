### Potential error location:
The potential error in the code is the logic for handling the indentation of comments and the incorrect manipulation of the `current_line` and `lines` variables.


### Cause of the bug:
The issue arises from the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not correctly handling the indentation of comments in the presence of tabs. It fails to retain the correct indentation for the comment when it appears after a dedent, leading to incorrect formatting.


### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by adjusting the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments, especially after a dedent. This may involve identifying when a dedent occurs, preserving the correct indentation level, and ensuring that the comment is handled accordingly.


### Corrected version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_indent = True  # add a flag to track waiting for an indent
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_indent:  # check if waiting for an indent
                wait_for_indent = False  # update the flag
            else:
                # already indented, add the line to the result
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_indent = True  # reset the flag for the next line
        else:
            wait_for_indent = False  # update the flag when a non-indent character is encountered
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
In the corrected version, additional logic has been added to ensure that the correct indentation level for comments is preserved, especially after a dedent. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure the correct handling of comments and indentation in the presence of tabs.
