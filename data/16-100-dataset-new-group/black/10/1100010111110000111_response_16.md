The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix of a text and return the consumed text and the remaining text. The buggy function appears to have issues with handling indentation and line breaks, which is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to produce incorrect results.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is specifically checking the indentation of comments within code blocks. The failing test raises an `AssertionError` indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output. This discrepancy is due to the incorrect handling of comments and their indentation within the code.

The GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent" provides additional context. It mentions that when there are tab characters in the input file, the indentation of comments is changed incorrectly after a dedent. The sample input and the reformatted output provided in the issue align with the failing test and the observed behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the indentation for comments is correctly preserved during dedents, especially when tabs are used for indentation.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle the indentation of comments correctly, leading to the failing test and the described behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab (adjust if needed)
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0  # Reset the column count for a new line
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the wait flag for a new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have added handling for the case when a tab character is encountered, adjusting the `current_column` by a specified amount to accommodate the indentation level. Additionally, we have made modifications to correctly handle the newline characters and the position of column and lines in the code.

With the corrected function, the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should now pass, and the issue reported in GitHub should be resolved as well.
