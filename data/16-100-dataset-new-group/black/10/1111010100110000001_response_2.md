The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class is not correctly handling the indentation of comments. This is causing the failing test to produce an AssertionError.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly accounting for the indentation of comments when processing the input prefix. This results in the incorrect handling of comments, leading to the discrepancy in the test results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation of comments as it processes each character in the input prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_column < column and char == '#':
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function accounts for the correct processing of comments and their indentation, and it should now pass the failing test.
