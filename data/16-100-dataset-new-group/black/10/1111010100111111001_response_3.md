To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to address the issue where the comment is not being consumed correctly, leading to incorrect indentation comparison. The current implementation does not handle the case where the comment is at the end of a line with leading spaces or tabs.

We can fix this bug by modifying the logic to properly handle consuming the comment and adjusting the indentation. We should also ensure that the consumed prefix and remaining prefix are correctly returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if not current_line.strip():  # Skip empty lines
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                    elif current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    else:
                        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():  # Skip empty lines
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected implementation, the tests should now pass, and the function should correctly return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.
