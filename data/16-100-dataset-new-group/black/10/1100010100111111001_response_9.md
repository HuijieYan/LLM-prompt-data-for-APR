The issue with the provided _partially_consume_prefix function is that it fails to correctly handle the indentation and comments in the prefix string.

When analyzing the failing test scenarios, we can see that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and comment characters. This leads to incorrect behavior and a failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles spaces, tabs, and newlines while keeping track of the current column and lines.

Based on the analysis, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
