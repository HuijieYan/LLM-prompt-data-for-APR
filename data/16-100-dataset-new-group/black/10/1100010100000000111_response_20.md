The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the Black library is incorrectly changing the indentation for comments past depth 0 after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.

The potential error in the _partially_consume_prefix function is within the logic for handling tab characters and new lines. The function is not correctly tracking the indentation level and handling tab characters, leading to incorrect results when processing tabulated comments.

To fix the bug, the strategy will involve properly tracking the column and handling tab characters to ensure that the correct indentation is maintained for tabulated comments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of tab characters has been fixed to correctly calculate the column position and add the necessary spaces to match the tab behavior. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
