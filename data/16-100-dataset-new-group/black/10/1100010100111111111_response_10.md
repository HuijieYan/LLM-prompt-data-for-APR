The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing an incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. The function is not properly handling the indentation for comments when the input file uses tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. This leads to incorrect formatting of the comments, as observed in the failing test case.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. It should ensure that the comments maintain the same level of indentation as the code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    if current_line:
        lines.append(current_line)

    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

With this corrected function, the indentation for comments after a dedent will be handled correctly, ensuring that the comments maintain the same level of indentation as the code. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
