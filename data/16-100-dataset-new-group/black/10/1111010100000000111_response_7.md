## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The conditional check for `char == '\t'` does not account for the possibility of the presence of tabs in the input.
- The `current_column` is incremented by 4 for every tab, which may lead to incorrect indentation.

## Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle tab characters correctly, causing incorrect indentation when parsing the input text.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the conditional check for tab characters to correctly handle tabs.
2. Update the way the `current_column` is incremented to account for the presence of tabs in the input.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column += 1
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                next_tab_stop = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_column += next_tab_stop
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function now correctly handles tab characters and ensures that the indentation is calculated accurately, resolving the issue with incorrect indentation when using tabs in the input file.
