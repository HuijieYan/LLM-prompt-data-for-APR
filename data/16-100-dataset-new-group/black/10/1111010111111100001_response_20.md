The cause of the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the implementation of indentation handling and line breaks. The function incorrectly identifies different levels of indentation and the presence of line breaks within the given prefix.

The incorrect identification of whitespace characters, tabs, and line breaks causes the function to produce incorrect output, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling whitespace characters, tabs, and line breaks. The function should correctly identify the indentation level and line breaks when constructing the lines list. It should also properly handle the current line and column.

Here's the updated and corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test case should now pass.
