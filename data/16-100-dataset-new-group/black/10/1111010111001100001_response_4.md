The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the input correctly, leading to incorrect behavior and failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that when encountering a newline character, the function does not correctly handle the indentation level and whether it should wait for the next newline. This leads to incorrect splitting of the prefix string.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function correctly tracks the current line and column, and waits for the next newline character before determining the prefix to consume.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        if current_column >= column:
            break
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should correctly consume the prefix based on the given column.
