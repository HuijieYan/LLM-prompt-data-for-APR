The cause of the bug is the incorrect calculation of the current_column value when encountering tabs in the input. This causes the incorrect handling of the indentation level, resulting in the behavior described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab characters when calculating the current_column value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the current_column value for tab characters
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function will handle tab characters correctly when calculating the current_column value, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
