The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing an indentation issue with the given test case `test_comment_indentation`. The failing test specifically calls `self.assertFormatEqual(fs(contents_tab), contents_spc)`, which compares the formatting of `contents_tab` and `contents_spc`. The error message indicates that the two strings are not equal due to an indentation mismatch in the comment line.

The problem with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function appears to be related to handling the indentation and new lines within the `prefix` string. It fails to properly handle the new lines and update the current column when encountering tab or space characters.

To address the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation and new lines in the `prefix` string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through each character in the `prefix` string and appropriately updates the `current_line` and `current_column`. The `lines` list is used to store the lines encountered, and the `res` variable is updated to accumulate the processed lines and characters. This corrected version should resolve the indentation mismatch issue and ensure that the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` passes successfully.
