The cause of the bug is that the current implementation does not handle the indentation of comments correctly, especially when using tabs instead of spaces. This results in incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments. This can be achieved by keeping track of the current indentation level and applying the appropriate indentation to the comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent = ""
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(indent + current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            indent += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            indent += char
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            indent = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), indent + current_line

```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the indentation of comments correctly, ensuring that the comments are indented the same as the next line after a dedent. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
