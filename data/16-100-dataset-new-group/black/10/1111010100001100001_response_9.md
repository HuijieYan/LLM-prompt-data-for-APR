The buggy function is intended to partially consume the input prefix string until it reaches a specific column. However, there are some issues with how it handles the new line characters and how it updates the state variables.

The main cause of the bug is that the function doesn't correctly handle the case when the prefix string is empty or when it reaches the end of the string without encountering a new line. This results in incorrect values for the return variables.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic of the function to properly handle these edge cases and update the state variables accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    if not prefix or column <= 0:
        return "", prefix
    
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            else:
                current_column += 1
        else:
            break
    
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version of the function handles the edge cases where the prefix string is empty or when the target column is less than or equal to zero. It also updates the state variables and returns the correct values for the output variables based on the input parameters.
