The cause of the bug is that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent, causing the comments to be indented incorrectly. This is evident from the failing test function `test_comment_indentation`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The correction involves moving the check and append logic for the commented lines outside of the conditional block for `wait_for_nl`, so that it is executed regardless of the value of `wait_for_nl`. This ensures the correct handling of indentation for comments after a dedent.

With the above correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the indentation of comments after a dedent correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
