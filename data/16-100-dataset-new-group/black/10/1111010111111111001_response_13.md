## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_column = 0  # move the line reset statement inside this condition
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_column = 0  # resetting the current column when the indent is finished
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The bug in the original function is that the `current_column` is not being correctly reset when a newline character is encountered. This causes incorrect indentation calculations and results in the failing test.

By adding and moving the `current_column` reset statement inside the newline conditions, the corrected function ensures that the current column is correctly reset when a newline is encountered, leading to the expected behavior.
