The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string, consuming only the portion up to a certain column. However, the function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters when processing the input prefix. This causes it to incorrectly consume part of the input prefix, leading to the indentation issue seen in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is related to the mishandling of indentation and newline characters. The function does not properly reset the `wait_for_nl` flag and `current_column` when encountering a newline character after consuming a non-empty line. This causes the function to continue processing the input incorrectly, leading to the unexpected indentation changes in the output.

To fix the bug, the function should properly reset the state variables (`wait_for_nl`, `current_column`, `current_line`) when encountering a newline character after consuming a non-empty line. Additionally, it should handle the cases of tabs and spaces differently to accurately calculate the column offset.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly consume the prefix up to the specified column while preserving the indentation and newline characters, addressing the indentation issue reported in the GitHub issue.
