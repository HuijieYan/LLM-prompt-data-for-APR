The buggy function has several issues that need to be fixed:
1. The 'if wait_for_nl' condition does not reset the current_line and current_column when the 'if char == '\n'' condition is not met.
2. The current_line is not properly added to the lines list when the 'if wait_for_nl' condition is met.
3. The function does not handle the case when the prefix ends and the wait_for_nl condition is still True.

To fix these issues, the function should be updated as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, current_line
```
