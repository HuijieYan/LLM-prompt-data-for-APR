The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the indentation of comments when using tabs. It fails to preserve the correct indentation of comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect reformatting of the code by changing the indentation of comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly handle the indentation of comments. It does not consider the correct column position for comments and improperly handles the logic for indentations using tabs.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments and preserve the correct column positions. The logic for identifying the correct column position and handling the wait for a new line should be revised to accurately handle the indentation of comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # Unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function now correctly handles the tab indentation by adjusting the `current_column` by 8 when encountering a tab character. This ensures that the function accurately tracks the column position for both spaces and tabs, preserving the correct indentation of comments.
