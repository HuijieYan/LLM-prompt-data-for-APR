The buggy function is _partially_consume_prefix within the Driver class. The function is designed to partially consume a prefix and return the consumed part as well as the remaining part. However, there are potential error locations in the function, such as the handling of indentation and newline characters.

The cause of the bug in the function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation and newline characters when consuming the prefix. This results in incorrect parsing of the prefix and incorrect splitting into consumed and remaining parts.

To fix the bug, we should revise the logic for handling the indentation and newline characters, ensuring that the function correctly consumes the prefix and separates the consumed part from the remaining part.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have adjusted the logic for handling indentation and newline characters, ensuring that the function correctly consumes the prefix and separates the consumed part from the remaining part.
