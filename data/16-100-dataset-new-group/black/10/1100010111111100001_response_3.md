The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function seems to be that it does not properly handle whitespace characters, resulting in an incorrect behavior when consuming the prefix string. This leads to incorrect output when comparing the result of the function with the expected output in the failing test cases.

The function should properly consume the prefix based on the given column parameter and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

To fix the bug, the logic of consuming the prefix needs to be adjusted to correctly handle whitespace characters, newline characters, and indentation levels.


Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly consumes the prefix based on the given column parameter, taking into account correct handling of whitespace characters, newline characters, and indentation levels.

Running the failing test cases with this corrected function should result in the test passing successfully.
