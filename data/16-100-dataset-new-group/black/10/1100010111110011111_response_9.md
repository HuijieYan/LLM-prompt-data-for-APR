In the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, the issue seems to be with the logic of checking and updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables. This is causing incorrect indentation and leading to the failing test case.

The cause of the bug can be explained by the fact that for tabulated comments after a dedent, the indentation is incorrectly changed.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the tabulated comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above corrected implementation, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
