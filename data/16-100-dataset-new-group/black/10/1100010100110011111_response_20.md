## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After analyzing the buggy function and the error message, it seems that the issue arises from the handling of newline characters and indentation. The code does not properly handle the indentation level of comments after a dedent.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to revise how the function handles newlines and indentation. Specifically, we need to ensure that the indentation level of comments is maintained correctly after a dedent.

I have made the necessary corrections to the function. Now it should properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, ensuring that the expected values and types of variables are satisfied for all the test cases. This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the incorrect indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent.
