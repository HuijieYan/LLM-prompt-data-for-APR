The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. This bug specifically affects lines with tabs for indentation. The function fails to handle tab indentation properly, resulting in incorrect behavior for comments after a dedent.

The issue arises from the way the function handles tab indentation, causing it to misinterpret the column width and incorrectly process comments after dedent.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab indentation and ensure proper column tracking.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Adjust for tab spacing
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes the handling of tab indentation by adjusting the current column width appropriately. With this modification, the function should be able to correctly handle tab indentation and resolve the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
