The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix of text and return the remaining prefix after consuming some characters based on the input column value. However, there are several issues with the logic. 

The key issue is that the function incorrectly handles the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, causing the comments to be reformatted incorrectly when the input file uses tabs.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
            else:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False

        if char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            # indent is finished
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected function, we properly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent by checking if the current line should be added to the lines list based on the column value. We also reset the current line and column when encountering a newline character.

This corrected version should resolve the issue of incorrectly changed indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent and satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the GitHub issue.
