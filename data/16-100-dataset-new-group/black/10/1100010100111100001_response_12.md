The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column. It processes the characters in the prefix, updates the current line and column counters, and checks for certain characters to determine when to stop consuming the prefix.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the scenario where the comment starts after some indentation and immediately before the end of the line. This results in an incorrect split of the prefix, leading to the assertion failure in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the function to properly handle the case when a comment is at the end of an indented line. We can achieve this by modifying the condition for handling newline characters and reassigning the `res` variable to include the current line when a comment is encountered in a partially indented line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This modification adjusts the logic to correctly handle the given failing test scenarios, ensuring that the function returns the expected results.
