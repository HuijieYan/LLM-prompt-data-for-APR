### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix and updating the lines and current line based on certain conditions. The error message is related to an incorrect indentation change for tabulated comments after a dedent. The GitHub issue also confirms that the issue occurs when the input file uses tabs.

### Identify potential error locations
1. The condition for handling tab characters may be incorrectly updating the current column.
2. The `wait_for_nl` condition might not be working as expected.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the tab characters and the newline characters, which results in incorrect indentation changes, especially for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the condition for tab characters to accurately calculate the current column.
2. Check the logic for handling newline characters and the `wait_for_nl` condition to ensure proper handling of indentation.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Update column appropriately for tab characters
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
By updating the code to handle tab characters and the newline character conditions correctly, the bug should be resolved.
