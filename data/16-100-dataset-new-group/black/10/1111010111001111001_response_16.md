There is a bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It fails when there is a comment line immediately following an indented block, such as in the failing test `test_comment_indentation`. The bug is caused by incorrectly checking for the correct indentation level before a comment line.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to accurately track the current indentation level and then compare it to the expected column value. Another approach is to iterate through the input `prefix` string and correctly update the `current_column` variable based on the encountered characters.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
This corrected version includes proper handling of the indentation level and correctly updating `current_column` based on the encountered characters.
