The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is caused by the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag. This flag is intended to wait for a new line character, at which point it should check the current line's length against the specified column. When the conditions are satisfied, it should return the consumed prefix and the remaining suffix.

A corrective strategy would involve refactoring the logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` flag and updating the way the consumed prefix and remaining suffix are extracted.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the `wait_for_nl` flag correctly and return the consumed prefix and remaining suffix based on the defined column.
