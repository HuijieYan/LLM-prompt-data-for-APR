The issue described on GitHub suggests that the indentation for comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. The buggy function seems to be related to handling the indentation and newlines in the input prefix.

The potential error in the buggy code is that the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset after processing a newline character, which could lead to incorrect handling of subsequent lines.

Additionally, the logic for updating the `current_column` variable seems to be insufficient, as the buggy function does not account for occurrences of tabs and their impact on the column position.

To fix the bug, the function should reset the `wait_for_nl` flag after processing a newline character, and the logic for updating the `current_column` should be improved to accurately reflect the indentation level, especially with tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust current_column based on the number of spaces a tab represents
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset wait_for_nl flag after processing a newline character
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0  # Reset current_column for a new line
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version of the function, the handling of newlines, tabs, and indentation tracking should be more accurate, and it should address the issue described on GitHub.
