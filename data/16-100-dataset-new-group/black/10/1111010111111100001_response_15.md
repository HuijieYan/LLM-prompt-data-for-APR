In the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, the issue lies in the logic related to identifying a newline character and consuming the prefix based on the column value. The condition for checking if a character is a newline and the condition for checking if the next character should be waited for to identify the end of indentation is wrongly implemented.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the end of indentation and is not consuming the prefix correctly, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function's logic should be modified to correctly identify the end of the indentation and consume the prefix based on the column value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n' and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                break
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected logic, the function should now correctly identify the end of the indentation and consume the prefix based on the column value, passing the failing tests.
