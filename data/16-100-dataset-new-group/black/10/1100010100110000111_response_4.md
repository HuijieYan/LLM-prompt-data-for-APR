### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to partially consume a prefix and calculate the indentation level in Python's `black` library. The error message suggests that the comment indentation is being incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent, which aligns with the GitHub issue description.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag might not be toggled correctly.
2. Calculation of `current_column` might have errors for tab characters.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of tab characters in the input. Tab indentation is not accurately calculated and leads to incorrect dedentation of the comment.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to ensure that the indentation level is correctly calculated for tab characters and the `wait_for_nl` flag is toggled at the right times.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of tab characters has been modified to correctly calculate the indentation level. The `wait_for_nl` flag is also toggled at the right times to handle comment indentation correctly. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
