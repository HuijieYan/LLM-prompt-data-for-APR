The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class in the file `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`. This function is meant to partially consume the prefix of a string based on a given column. However, there is an issue with indentation handling in the function, which is causing the failing test to raise an AssertionError.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation level of comments. In the failing test, the indentation of the comment is not being preserved when consuming the prefix, which results in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to properly handle the indentation of comments as it partially consumes the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        in_comment = False  # Track if we are inside a comment
        for char in prefix:
            if in_comment or not wait_for_nl:
                current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    if in_comment:
                        in_comment = False  # Reset comment flag
            if char == ' ' and not in_comment:
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t' and not in_comment:
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '#':
                in_comment = True  # Set comment flag
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the indentation of comments and pass the failing test.
