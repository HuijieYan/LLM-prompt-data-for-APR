The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely causing the indentation issue mentioned in the GitHub issue. It seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation and waiting for a newline before consuming the prefix.

The cause of the bug is likely that the function does not properly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment after a dedent. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the indentation level, especially when encountering comments after a dedent.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, the indentation issue mentioned in the GitHub issue should be resolved. The test function `test_comment_indentation` should also pass with this corrected version.
