The potential error in the _partially_consume_prefix function lies in the logic related to handling whitespace and newlines. The function is supposed to partially consume the given prefix string based on the specified column value, but the logic doesn't seem to be handling whitespace and newline characters properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the indentation levels and handling newline characters.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully revise the logic for handling whitespace, tabs, and newlines, ensuring that the function accurately tracks the column position and processes the prefix string accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now accurately consume the prefix string based on the specified column value, and it should pass the failing test.
