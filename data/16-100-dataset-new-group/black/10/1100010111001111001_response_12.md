The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is the logic around handling the indentation level and consuming the prefix text. When the function reaches a newline character, it checks if the current_line is non-empty and if the current_column is less than the specified column. If so, it captures the result and returns the remaining prefix string. However, the logic for handling the indentation level is causing issues.

One potential issue is with the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag. When a non-space character is encountered, the flag is set to True, indicating that the function should start waiting for a newline character to finish the current indentation level. However, in some cases, this flag is not being reset properly, resulting in incorrect handling of subsequent characters.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling `wait_for_nl` needs to be revised to ensure that it accurately reflects the indentation level. Additionally, the processing of characters within the prefix needs to be validated to ensure proper capturing of the result and the remaining prefix string.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated version of the function includes adjustments to properly handle the `wait_for_nl` flag and correctly capture the result and remaining prefix string. With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
