The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent in the test case `test_comment_indentation`. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation when the input file uses tabs, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for handling indentation and new lines, especially when encountering tab characters.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the tab characters when calculating the current column for indentation. This causes the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling tab characters and calculating the current column for indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == '\t':
                    current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
                else:
                    current_column += 1

                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we handle the tab characters separately and calculate the current column correctly. This should resolve the issue of incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.
