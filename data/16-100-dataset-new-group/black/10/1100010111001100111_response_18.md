The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the indentation of comments in the input text when using tabs, leading to incorrect reformatting of the code. This issue is reflected in the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the logic for handling tab characters and checking the column width.

The cause of the bug is incorrect handling of tab characters and column tracking, leading to incorrect indentation of comments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the column position while handling tab characters and ensure that comments are correctly indented.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            expanded_tab = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += expanded_tab
            current_line += " " * expanded_tab
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should address the indentation issue and ensure that comments are correctly indented when using tabs. It should also pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
