The potential error in the function lies in the logic used to handle tab characters in the input prefix. The logic for tab characters as shown in the code does not correctly handle the indentation with tabs, which aligns with the issue reported in the GitHub post.


The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle tab characters properly while calculating the current column. This leads to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.


To fix the bug, a strategy can be to accurately calculate the current column taking into account the tab size and handle the tab character while updating the current column. Also, the logic for handling the tab character and wait_for_nl flag needs to be adjusted to correctly identify the end of the indentation.


Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tabs = (4 - (current_column % 4))
            current_line += ' ' * tabs
            current_column += tabs
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the issue reported in the GitHub post should be resolved and the function should now accurately handle the indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs in the input file.
