The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing the failing test. The function is not in accordance with the expected input/output values in each scenario. The bug is caused by the improper handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition, which leads to incorrect indentation processing. To fix the bug, the functionality of `wait_for_nl` and conditions involving new lines and indentation should be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_line += char
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                current_line = char
            else:
                # indent is finished
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
