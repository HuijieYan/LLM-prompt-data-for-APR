The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be in the way it handles indentation followed by comments. The function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

The bug is likely caused by the `wait_for_nl` logic, which is not functioning correctly when encountering comments. This is evident from the failing test case where the indentation and comments are not being handled properly.

To fix the bug, we should re-evaluate the logic for handling different characters in the prefix string. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles spaces, tabs, newlines, and comments within the prefix string.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for i, char in enumerate(prefix):
        if current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[i:]
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column and handle comments and indentation as expected. This should address the failing test case and resolve the bug in the original function.
