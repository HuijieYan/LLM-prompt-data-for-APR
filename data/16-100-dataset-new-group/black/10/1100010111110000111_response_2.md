The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is being called by the `test_comment_indentation` method of the `BlackTestCase` class. The failing test is checking if the function `fs(contents_tab)` returns the expected output `contents_spc`.

The error message indicates that the indentation for the comments is being incorrectly changed after a dedent. This is consistent with the description of the GitHub issue, where it is mentioned that the indentation for comments is being changed incorrectly after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.

In the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the issue is likely related to how the function processes the input prefix to handle indentation. It seems that the function does not handle the indentation for comments correctly, especially when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comments when the input file uses tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the indentation for comments, especially when the input file uses tabs. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
