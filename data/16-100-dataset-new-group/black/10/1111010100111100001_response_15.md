The issue with the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it doesn't correctly handle lines ending with a comment. The bug is likely caused by not updating `current_column` correctly when encountering a comment in the last line of the prefix. This leads to the incorrect output when using the prefix to format a block of code.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that `current_column` is updated correctly when a comment ends a line. To do this, we can add `current_column = 0` when encountering a newline character. Additionally, we should modify the condition for returning the result by checking if the current column is less than the specified column for indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
    # Check if the last line's indentation is less than the specified column
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
