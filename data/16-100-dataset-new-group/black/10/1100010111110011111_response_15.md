### The analysis of the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to consume indentation and maintain the prefix of the given text. It seems to be related to an issue with the indentation of comments after a dedent. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` provides input text with both tab and space indentation and then checks if the formatting remains unchanged. The error message shows that the format is not equal as expected.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Handling of whitespace characters.
2. Management of `wait_for_nl` flag.
3. Calculation of `current_column` for tabs and spaces.

### The cause of the bug
The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of whitespace characters and the `wait_for_nl` flag. When encountering a newline character after a dedent, the function does not correctly handle the indentation of the following comment, leading to a change in formatting. This aligns with the reported GitHub issue about incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Make sure that the function correctly handles different types of whitespace characters (space, tab) to calculate the indentation level.
2. Adjust the logic related to the `wait_for_nl` flag to properly handle the indentation of comments.
3. Consider the GitHub issue about incorrect comment indentation after a dedent, and test for the given input scenarios to ensure the bug is fixed.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version adjusts the logic for handling different types of whitespace characters and the `wait_for_nl` flag to ensure correct prefix consumption and indentation maintenance. The corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
