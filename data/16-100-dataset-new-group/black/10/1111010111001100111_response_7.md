The issue appears to be related to incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. This is likely causing the failing test in the `test_comment_indentation` function. 

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation and new lines. It does not correctly handle the case where a comment is indented differently than the code it is associated with and may incorrectly consume part of the comment.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation of comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust the column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the column for tabs and adding a condition to handle new lines, the corrected function should now properly handle the indentation of comments and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This corrected function should now be able to pass the failing test and resolve the reported issue.
