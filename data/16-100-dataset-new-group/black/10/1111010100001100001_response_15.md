The bug in the function is that it incorrectly handles the case when a space character is encountered. It increments the `current_column` by 1, instead of appending the character to `current_line` and checking if the `current_column` is less than `column`. This causes the function to return incorrect values and not properly process the input prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling space characters and ensure that the `current_line` is correctly updated. Additionally, the logic for handling the tab character should also be reviewed to ensure it correctly updates the `current_column`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1
            if current_column > column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle space and tab characters, as well as correctly update the `current_line` and `current_column`, leading to correct output values for the given runtime input parameters.
