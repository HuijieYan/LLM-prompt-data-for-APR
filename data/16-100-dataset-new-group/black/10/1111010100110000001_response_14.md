The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to partially consume whitespace prefixes in a given string to determine how much of it needs to be consumed but it is not correctly handling the indentation levels of the input.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation levels and the special character '\t' (tab) which results in incorrect consumption of prefixes, leading to the failing test. Specifically, when the contents have mixed spaces and tabs, the function does not handle it properly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the indentation level and correctly consume prefixes based on tabs and spaces in the input string.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Change tab character to 4 spaces
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset current_column for new line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # If character is not space or tab, then set wait_for_nl to True
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle both spaces and tabs correctly, and in turn, pass the failing test.
