The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string and separate it into two parts based on a given column value. The function accumulates characters from the prefix string, tracks the current line, column, and waits for a new line to determine the indentation level. However, based on the GitHub issue and the runtime input/output values, it appears that the function is incorrectly handling the indentation and new line characters, leading to incorrect results.

The bug seems to stem from the handling of indentation and new line characters within the prefix string. The function fails to appropriately update the current column and detect the correct indentation level, especially when encountering tab characters.

To fix the bug, we need to improve the logic for tracking the current column and handle tab characters properly to accurately determine the indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for a tab
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the `wait_for_nl` variable and instead immediately handle the new line characters to update the `current_column` and `lines` based on the indentation level. We also explicitly handle the tab character by incrementing the `current_column` by a certain number of spaces.

This corrected version should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and produce the expected results for the given input cases.
