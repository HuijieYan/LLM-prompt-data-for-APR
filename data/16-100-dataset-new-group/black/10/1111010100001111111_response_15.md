The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to incorrectly handling the indentation of comments when using tabs. The function is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column value. However, it fails to properly handle the indentation when encountering tab characters.

The function fails to accurately track the column and handle tab characters, leading to incorrect partial prefix consumption.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly calculate the column value when encountering tab characters and appropriately handle the indentation for comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column + 8) // 8 * 8  # adjust the column based on tab width
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes proper handling of tab characters and correct calculation of the column value. This should resolve the issue related to incorrectly changing the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
