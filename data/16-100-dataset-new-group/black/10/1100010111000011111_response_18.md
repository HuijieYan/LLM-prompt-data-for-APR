To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, we need to address the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The function should correctly handle the indentation of comments to match the next line after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip().endswith("#"):
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The changes made to the function include:
1. Adding logic to handle the indentation of comments after a dedent by checking if the current line ends with a comment.
2. Adjusting the indentation count based on spaces or tabs.

With these changes, the corrected function should now handle the indentation of comments after a dedent correctly and pass the failing test case.
