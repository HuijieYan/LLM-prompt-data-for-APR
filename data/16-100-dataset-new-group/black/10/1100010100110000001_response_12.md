The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be causing incorrect indentation in the output, which is leading to a failing test. 

The cause of the bug is likely an issue with the logic for handling tabs and spaces as well as the unexpected empty line. This results in incorrect indentation and the function not returning the expected output.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling tabs and spaces needs to be modified and the condition for handling an unexpected empty line needs to be reevaluated.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += ' ' * 4  # replace tab with four spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should handle tabs and spaces as well as unexpected empty lines correctly, and it should pass the failing test.
