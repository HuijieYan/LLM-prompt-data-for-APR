The cause of the bug: 

The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, where the indentation of comments is calculated incorrectly, especially after a dedent. This leads to incorrect formatting of the comments, causing the failing test cases.

The strategy for fixing the bug:

The bug can be fixed by properly handling the calculation of the column position for comments, especially after a dedent. The function should correctly identify the expected column for comments and adjust the indentation accordingly.

The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # adjust for tabulation
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function handles the tabulation correctly and adjusts the column calculation for comments after a dedent. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
