The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a line of text and partially consume the characters upto a certain column limit. It maintains the current column position and handles different types of characters including spaces, tabs, and new lines.

The potential error locations within the function are where the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being properly reset and updated, and when the prefix is being sliced incorrectly in the `wait_for_nl` condition.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset properly, which affects the behavior of consuming the prefix and results in incorrect indentation.

To fix the bug, we will need to properly handle and reset the `wait_for_nl` flag, and correctly slice the prefix in the `wait_for_nl` condition to ensure that the indentation is correctly maintained.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
The corrected version ensures that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly reset and updated, and the prefix slicing is done correctly to maintain the expected indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
