The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string, keeping track of line and column positions. It seems to have an issue with handling the indentation of comments in the test function `test_comment_indentation` as it fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments when converting from tabs to spaces.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional checks for space, tab, and newline characters, as well as the computation of the current column position.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the indentation level of the comment when converting tabs to spaces, leading to incorrect handling of indentation in the test function.

To fix the bug, we can update the algorithm for handling the indentation in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the conversion of tabs to spaces and maintains the correct indentation level for each line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the indentation of comments and should pass the failing test.
