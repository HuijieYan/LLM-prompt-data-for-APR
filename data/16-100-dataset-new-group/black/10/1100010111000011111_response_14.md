To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. Based on the failing test function and the expected input/output values, we can see that the function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent.

The bug seems to be related to the `wait_for_nl` flag not being properly reset, resulting in incorrect handling of the newline character and indentation. Additionally, the logic for building the `current_line` seems to be incorrect, leading to incorrect indentation for comments.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling the indentation and reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when necessary. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test provided.
