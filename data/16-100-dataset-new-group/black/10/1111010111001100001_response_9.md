The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the scenario where the prefix includes comment lines with mixed indentation.

The potential errors in the function include:
1. Inconsistent handling of spaces and tabs for calculating `current_column`
2. Incorrect handling of `wait_for_nl`

To fix the bug, we should update the code to accurately track the current indentation level and check for a change in indentation when determining when to stop consuming the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:  # char is tab
                current_column += (4 - current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should handle scenarios with mixed indentation for comment lines and pass the failing test.
