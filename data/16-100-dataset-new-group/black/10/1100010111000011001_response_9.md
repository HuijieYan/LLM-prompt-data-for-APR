The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function occurs when processing lines starting with spaces or tabs and containing comments. It fails to correctly handle the indentation level and waits for a newline before appending the comment to the lines list. This results in incorrect indentation of comments in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling indentation and comments within the _partially_consume_prefix function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the _partially_consume_prefix function should now pass the failing test case by correctly handling the indentation of comments.
