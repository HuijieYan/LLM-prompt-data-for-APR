To fix the buggy function, we need to address the issue with the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. Based on the failing test and expected input/output values, we can identify potential error locations within the buggy function. The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of indentation levels and processing of newline characters.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves revising the logic for indentation handling and accounting for tab characters in the input prefix. By adjusting the logic for handling indentation levels and newline characters, we can ensure that the function correctly processes the input prefix and maintains the expected indentation for comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                if wait_for_nl:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                if wait_for_nl:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if wait_for_nl:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the input prefix correctly and produce the expected output values for the failing test cases. It addresses the indentation issue for comment lines and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
