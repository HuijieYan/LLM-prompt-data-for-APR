The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class and is designed to process indentation in a code file, particularly when dealing with comments. 

The potential error in the function lies in the logic that handles the indentation level when encountering a comment after a dedent. This logic incorrectly resets the `current_column` value, leading to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent in the processed text.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` shows that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to how the function handles tab-based indentation and comments after a dedent. The issue describes that when the input file uses tabs, the indentation for comments after a dedent is changed incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` should be updated to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    # Check the original indentation of the line before processing
                    indent_spaces = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip(' '))
                    if current_column < column and current_column < indent_spaces:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
            elif char == '\n':
                # Unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function checks the original indentation of the line before processing the comment. It ensures that the comment is correctly aligned with the next line, taking into account any dedents and the use of tabs for indentation.

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs, and pass the failing test.
