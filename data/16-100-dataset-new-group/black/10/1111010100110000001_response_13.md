The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation and spacing of the input `prefix`. This is resulting in incorrect output and causing the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly calculating the indentation and not handling new lines and comments properly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters, spaces, new lines, and comments in the input `prefix`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ' and not wait_for_nl:  # Only increment column if not waiting for new line
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t' and not wait_for_nl:  # Only increment column if not waiting for new line
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                current_line += char  # Include new line character in the current_line
            else:  # Only start waiting for new line if char is not a space or tab
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

With this correction, the function should handle the indentation, spaces, new lines, and comments properly, resulting in the correct output for the test case.
