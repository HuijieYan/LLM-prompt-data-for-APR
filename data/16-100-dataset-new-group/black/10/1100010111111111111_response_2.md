Explanation of the bug and the correction:
The bug in the original function is caused by the incorrect handling of the indentation level when encountering a new line character. The `current_column` should also be reset to 0 when a new line is encountered, but this was not happening in the original function, leading to incorrect indentation.

Additionally, the function was not considering the case when the current_column is equal to the specified column, which caused it to skip the intended indent level and resulted in incorrect output.

The correction involves:
1. Resetting the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a new line character.
2. Changing the comparison from `<` to `<=` when checking if the current_column is less than or equal to the specified column.
3. Adjusting the increment for tab characters to align with the standard 8-column width according to PEP-8 guidelines.

This corrected version of the function should address the indentation issues and align with the expected input/output values. It will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
