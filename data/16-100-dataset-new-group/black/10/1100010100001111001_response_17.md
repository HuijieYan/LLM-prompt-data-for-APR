The bug in the function seems to be related to the way the function is handling indentation levels and new lines. The function is not properly updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables in some cases, leading to incorrect output.

The bug is likely caused by not properly handling scenarios where indentation changes or when a new line character is encountered within the loop. This is causing the function to incorrectly identify the prefix that needs to be consumed and returned.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables are updated correctly whenever there is a change in indentation or a new line character is encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated version of the function should handle the cases more accurately and produce the expected outputs for all the test cases listed.
