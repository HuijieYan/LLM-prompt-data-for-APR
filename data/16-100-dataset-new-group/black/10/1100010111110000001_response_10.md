The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix by consuming whitespace and newline characters up to a specified column. It then returns the consumed lines and the remaining prefix.

However, the buggy function is not properly handling the indentation of comments in the input string, leading to a failing test in the `test_comment_indentation` function. The test expects the indentation of a comment to be correctly formatted, but the buggy function fails to handle the indentation properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the indentation of comments correctly, resulting in the incorrect output when processing the input strings with comments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation of comments in the input string. This can be achieved by modifying the logic for consuming whitespace and considering the indentation of comments in the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the wait_for_nl flag
        else:
            # Check if the current_line contains a comment
            comment_index = current_line.find('#')
            if comment_index != -1 and comment_index < current_column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function correctly resets the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline character. It also checks for the presence of a comment in the `current_line` and correctly handles its indentation.

With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test for comment indentation.
