The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it does not handle the case where the last line of the prefix does not end with a newline character. This causes incorrect column tracking and an incomplete result. Additionally, the condition for checking whether the current line is empty is not properly implemented.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function handles the case where the last line of the prefix does not end with a newline character, and also properly sets the `current_column` when processing whitespace characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the cases where the last line of the prefix does not end with a newline character and properly track the column when processing whitespace characters.
