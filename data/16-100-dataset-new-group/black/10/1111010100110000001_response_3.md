The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not properly handling the indentation in the `contents_tab` test case, which is causing the `assertFormatEqual` test case to fail. The function is not correctly identifying when to wait for a new line, resulting in incorrect indentation handling.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation when encountering spaces and tabs, leading to an incorrect output and failing the test.

To fix the bug, the function should properly track the indentation and handle spaces, tabs, and new lines to accurately determine the remaining prefix after consuming a part of it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char.strip():  # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues with handling spaces, tabs, and new lines to properly identify the remaining prefix after consuming a part of it. This should ensure that the `assertFormatEqual` test case passes successfully.
