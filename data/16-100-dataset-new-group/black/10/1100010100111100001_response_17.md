The bug in the given code is that the implementation does not correctly handle the indentation level before a comment. The logic is failing to properly handle the case where there is an indentation before the comment and there are spaces preceding the comment. To fix this, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the indentation level before a comment.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    last_indent_level = 0  # track the indentation level before the comment
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and last_indent_level < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                last_indent_level = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            last_indent_level += 1  # increment the last indentation level
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            last_indent_level += 4  # increment the last indentation level
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            last_indent_level = 0  # reset the last indentation level
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version correctly handles the indentation level before the comment by tracking the last indentation level encountered before encountering the comment. This ensures that the correct indentation level is used when checking against the specified column value.

This should fix the failing tests, and the corrected function should now return the expected output.
