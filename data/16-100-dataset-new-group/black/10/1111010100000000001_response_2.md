## Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string by consuming a portion of it up to a certain column. The function maintains `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables to keep track of the progress.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` might not function as intended, leading to incorrect output.
2. The logic for updating `current_column` and handling different types of characters might be incorrect.
3. The handling of the last portion of the prefix in the loop might cause unexpected behavior.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of indentation, newline characters, and maintaining the `current_column` count.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for tracking the `current_column` accurately, especially for indentations and newline characters.
2. Revise the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` to correctly determine the consumed portion of the prefix.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            if current_column >= column:
                break
        return prefix[:len(current_line)], prefix[len(current_line):]
```

In the corrected version, the function now iterates through the prefix string and updates the `current_column` accurately for spaces, tabs, and newline characters. It also correctly breaks the loop when the consumed portion reaches the specified column.
