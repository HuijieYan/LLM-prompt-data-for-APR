The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation and newline characters. When the function encounters a newline character, it should check whether the current column is less than the expected column and then return the result accordingly. However, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the cases where the current column is less than the expected column.

Based on the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the issue seems to be related to handling the indentation of comments within the code. The test compares the formatting of code with tabs and spaces, including comments, and expects them to be equal. This indicates that the bug may be related to how the function processes indentation and comments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately handle the indentation level and properly consume the prefix according to the given column. It should also consider the presence of comments and handle them appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly handles the indentation level, newline characters, and the presence of comments. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
