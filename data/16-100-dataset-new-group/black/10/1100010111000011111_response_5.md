To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, we need to adjust the logic to properly handle the indentation and comments. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip().startswith("#"):
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we included an additional check when encountering a newline character. If the current line starts with a comment ('#'), we set wait_for_nl to True, indicating that we are expecting the next newline character to continue the comment indentation. This should address the issue described in the GitHub problem.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
