The issue in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function could be causing the `test_comment_indentation` to fail. It seems that the function is not handling the indentation and newline characters correctly, which is crucial for the correct formatting of the code.

One potential problem in the function is the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag. It is not being reset after processing a newline character, so it may incorrectly wait for a newline in subsequent iterations.

Another issue is the condition where the function checks if the current column is less than the required column, this condition needs to be revised to ensure correct prefix processing.

To fix the bug, the _partially_consume_prefix function needs to properly handle the indentation and newline characters while also ensuring the correct determination of the prefix.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                if current_line.strip():
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            return ''.join(lines), current_line

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the `test_comment_indentation` should now pass successfully.
