To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, it's important to address the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent.

The main issue arises from the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation. The function should correctly handle the indentation of comments to ensure they are aligned with the code block.

The code should be modified to properly handle the indentation and alignment of comments in the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # Updated line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':  # Updated conditions to handle tab indentation correctly
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for tab
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the comments are correctly aligned with the code blocks, maintaining the desired indentation.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent.
