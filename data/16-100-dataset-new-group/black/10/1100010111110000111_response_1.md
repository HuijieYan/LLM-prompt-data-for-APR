The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect indentation when processing tabulated comments after a dedent. This can be seen in the failing test `test_comment_indentation` where the formatting is not equal for tabulated content and space-indented content.

The cause of the bug is related to the logic for handling tabulated comments and dedents within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It is failing to correctly adjust the indentation level for tabulated comments after a dedent, resulting in incorrect formatting.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling tabulated comments and dedents within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be adjusted to ensure correct indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char in ['\n', ' ']:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                if char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling tabulated comments and dedents has been adjusted to ensure correct indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
