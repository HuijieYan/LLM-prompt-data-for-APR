## Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. The buggy function fails to handle the case where the current column is less than the target column and there is an empty line between the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

## Bugs:
1. In the case of an unexpected empty line, the current column is not reset to 0.
2. When `wait_for_nl` is True, the current line is not added to the `lines` list.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not handle the case of an unexpected empty line between the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. As a result, the current column is not correctly reset, and the lines list does not capture the current line when waiting for a newline.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reset the `current_column` to 0 when encountering an unexpected empty line.
2. Add the current line to the `lines` list when waiting for a newline.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)  # capture the current line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset the current column to 0
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the wait_for_nl flag
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # indent is finished, wait for newline
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these fixes, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the case of an unexpected empty line and reset the current column, ensuring that the failing test case is resolved.
