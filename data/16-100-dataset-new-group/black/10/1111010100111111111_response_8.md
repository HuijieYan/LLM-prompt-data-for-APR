## Correction

### Cause of the bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent. The function is not correctly checking for the required conditions to maintain the correct indentation of comments. This leads to the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to properly handle the indentation and comments. The function should check for the presence of comments and maintain the correct indentation levels based on the input. Additionally, the function should handle different types of whitespace characters (such as tabs and spaces) to ensure consistent behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the indentation and newline characters. It checks for the conditions to maintain the correct indentation for comments and handles different whitespace characters.
