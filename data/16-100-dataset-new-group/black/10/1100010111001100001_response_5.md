The issue with the buggy function is that it fails to correctly calculate the indentation level when encountering a comment in the prefix string.

The bug occurs because the `wait_for_nl` flag is not reset after processing the newline character. This causes the function to incorrectly handle the indentation levels when encountering the comment.

To fix the bug, the `wait_for_nl` flag needs to be reset to `False` after processing the newline character.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the wait_for_nl flag
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels when encountering comments, and the failing test should pass.
