## The corrected function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        else:
            current_column += 1
            
        if current_column >= column:
            lines.append(current_line)
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The original function had an issue with handling the indentation when encountering tabs and new lines, which caused incorrect behavior when processing prefix strings. This led to the failing test case where comments were incorrectly indented after dedent.

The corrected function removes the 'wait_for_nl' flag and simplifies the logic to handle indentation with spaces and tabs accurately. It correctly calculates the current column position when encountering a tab character and adjusts it to the next multiple of 4. Furthermore, it checks for the column boundary condition and correctly appends the current line to the lines list, returning the correct prefix and the remaining unparsed prefix string.

This corrected function should now accurately handle the indentation and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
