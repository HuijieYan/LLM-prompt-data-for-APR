It appears that the function is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when encountering certain characters, leading to incorrect results. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset properly, and the handling of tab characters is inconsistent with the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, the function should properly update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables based on the encountered characters, and handle tab characters consistently with the given column values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the handling of tab characters to ensure that `current_column` is incremented correctly. Additionally, we have adjusted the condition for checking the column value before returning the result to be less than or equal to, rather than just less than `column`. This accounts for the case when the column is reached exactly.
