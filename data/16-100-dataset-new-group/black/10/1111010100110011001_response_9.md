The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method causes incorrect indentation and missing comments when processing the prefix of the input string.

The main issue with the function is that it incorrectly handles comments and indentation. When encountering a comment (`#`) followed by a newline (`\n`), it should skip the spaces and consume the comment before moving on to the next line. It incorrectly processes the comment's indentation, resulting in inconsistent and incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle comments and indentation. Additionally, we should track and update the current line's column and maintain consistency in processing the characters within the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '#':
            # ignore comments, consume till the end of the line
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset column count for new line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function now correctly processes the input string and handles comments and indentation as expected.
