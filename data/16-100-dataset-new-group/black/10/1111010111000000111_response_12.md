The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for handling indentation and waiting for the newline character. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation levels and newline characters, resulting in incorrect behavior when processing comments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly track the current indentation level and handle the newline characters within the provided prefix. Additionally, it should properly handle the waiting for the newline character when encountering indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if not wait_for_nl:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    # unexpected empty line
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the indentation and newline character, resolving the issue posted on GitHub. After this correction, the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should pass.
