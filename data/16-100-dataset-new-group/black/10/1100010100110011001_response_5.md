The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a prefix string up to a given column, while capturing the consumed lines. It seems to have a bug that causes incorrect indentation when consuming the prefix string. This results in failing the `test_comment_indentation` function in the `test_black` module.

The root cause of the bug is that the logic to handle indentation and newline characters is not working correctly. When encountering tabs, spaces, or newlines, the function should update the current line and column accordingly based on the tab width (4 spaces). However, the current logic is flawed, resulting in the mismatched indentation.

To fix the bug, we should update the implementation to correctly handle tab-width based indentation. Additionally, we should also handle the case where a line contains only whitespace or comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected implementation, the function should now handle indentation and newline characters correctly, satisfying the expected input/output values and passing the failing test.
