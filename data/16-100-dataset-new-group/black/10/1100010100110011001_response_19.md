The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the indentation level correctly, leading to incorrect results when trying to consume a prefix. This results in the 'if' statement not being properly indented and causing the assertion to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle whitespace and indentation levels, ensuring that the expected output matches the actual output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_indent = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_indent < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_indent = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_indent += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_indent += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_indent = 0
            current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should handle the indentation properly and produce the expected output, passing the failing test.
