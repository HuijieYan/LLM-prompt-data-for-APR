The bug in the given function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation of comments. This causes the output to be incorrect, as seen in the failing test message.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly track the indentation level when encountering a comment. It fails to consider the current column when checking for comments and returning the result.

To fix the bug, we need to keep track of the current column when encountering a comment and adjust the output according to the specified column value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == '#':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
