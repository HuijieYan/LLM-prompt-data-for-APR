The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is that it incorrectly handles the prefix and column input parameters. As a result, the function returns incorrect values, causing the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle indentation levels when processing the prefix string. This results in the function returning the incorrect prefix and, ultimately, failing the test.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly track the column and handle different types of whitespace characters (e.g., tabs and spaces) to determine the correct indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column and not char.isspace():
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
