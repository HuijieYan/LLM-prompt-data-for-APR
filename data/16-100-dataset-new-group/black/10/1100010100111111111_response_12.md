The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. The function seems to be mistakenly adding an extra space to the comment line when it should maintain the original indentation.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. This is evident from the failing test results where the indentation of the comment line is being altered incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function preserves the original indentation of the comment lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # preserve original indentation for comment lines
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, ensuring that the original indentation is preserved.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
