The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to properly handle indentation and capturing all lines with spaces and tabs when concatenating the prefix. The missing indentation from the commented line or lines appended to the `lines` list causes the failing test, as the trailing spaces before the comment are lost.

To fix the bug, add the current line to the `lines` list before resetting it. Ensure that the function is keeping track of all the lines and their indentation in order to maintain the correct formatting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)  # Add this line
                    current_line = ""  # Reset current_line
                    current_column = 0  # Reset current_column
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)  # Add this line
                current_line = ""  # Reset current_line
                current_column = 0  # Reset current_column
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle indentation, capturing and retaining the proper format when concatenating the prefix. This should address the failing test.
