The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing the failing test "test_comment_indentation" to fail. The function is meant to partially consume the given prefix and return the consumed part and the remaining part. However, the logic inside the function is incorrect, leading to incorrect results and failing test cases.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of indentation levels and new lines. It fails to properly count the number of spaces and tabs to determine the current column value and whether to wait for a new line. This leads to incorrect slicing of the prefix and producing unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we can revise the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and new lines, ensuring that the current column value is updated correctly, and the wait_for_nl flag is set/unset appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

        current_line += char

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
