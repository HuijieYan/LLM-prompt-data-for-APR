The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior for the indentation of comments. This is seen in the failing test for `test_comment_indentation`.

The bug occurs due to incorrect logic for identifying the start of a comment line. It causes the function to improperly return part of the input prefix in certain cases.

A strategy to fix this bug is to revise the logic for identifying and handling comment lines. Specifically, when encountering a ' #', the function should not wait for a newline and should immediately append the current line to the list of lines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4  # Adjust for tabs
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This revised function should address the bug and pass the failing test.
