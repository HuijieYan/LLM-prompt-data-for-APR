### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is meant to handle the indentation and partially consume the prefix of the given code. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is failing when comparing the expected output with the actual output, specifically when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Potential Error Locations
The issue seems to arise from how the function handles the indentation and newline characters, especially when dealing with tabulated comments.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handling the tabulated comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation in the reformatted output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- We need to ensure that the function correctly handles tabulated comments after a dedent.
- It's important to maintain consistent indentation levels for the comments following dedents.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                indentation = "\t" * (current_column // 4) + " " * (current_column % 4)  # Calculate correct indentation
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(indentation + current_line)  # Add correct indentation
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I have added a calculation for the correct indentation `indentation` for tabulated comments after a dedent, and then appended the lines with the correct indentation before adding to the `lines` list.

This correction addresses the bug by ensuring that tabulated comments after a dedent receive the correct indentation, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
