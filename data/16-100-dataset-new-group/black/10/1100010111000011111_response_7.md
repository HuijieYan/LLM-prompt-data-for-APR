To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, we need to address the incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent. The issue occurs when the input file uses tabs, and the indentation for comments is changed incorrectly after a dedent.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the _partially_consume_prefix function to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Modify the behavior for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # Adjust to handle comments after a dedent
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = column
        else:
            # Reset current_column when encountering non-indentation character
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the behavior for tabs and adjusting the handling of comments after a dedent, the corrected function should address the issue described in the GitHub report and pass the failing test cases.
