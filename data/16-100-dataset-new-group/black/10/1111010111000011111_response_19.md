## The corrected version of the function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjusting the tab width to 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Ensure correct column count after newline
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Adjust the tab width to 4 spaces to align with the expected indentation in the failing test.
- Ensure the correct column count after a newline is encountered to address the issue of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

Explanation:
The bug in the original function was caused by incorrect tab width calculations. By adjusting the tab width to 4 spaces and ensuring the correct column count after a newline, the corrected version of the function addresses the indentation issue reported in the GitHub issue.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values specified.
