The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has several potential error locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` seems to be incorrectly checking if the line is not empty and the current_column is less than the input column. This logic may not correctly handle the intended behavior, causing the function to return unexpected results.

2. The logic for handling indentation and newline characters could be causing unexpected behavior due to incorrect manipulation of `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is trying to compare the formatted contents with both space and tab indentation. The issue is related to incorrect indentation handling in the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`.

A strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the logic for handling indentation and newline characters to ensure correct calculation of `current_column` and `wait_for_nl`.
2. Update the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` to accurately check the intended condition based on the requirements.

The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        if not wait_for_nl:  # Only append non-empty lines
            current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of `_partially_consume_prefix` function should handle the indentation and newline characters correctly, allowing it to pass the failing test.
