The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column. However, it fails to do so correctly, resulting in incorrect behavior and unexpected indentation errors.

The bug arises from an incorrect condition that tracks when to wait for a new line. This leads to improper newline handling and results in incorrect indentation. As a result, the function fails to consume the prefix string accurately and returns an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the condition for determining when to wait for a new line should be adjusted to properly handle indentations and new lines within the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # Include the current line in the result
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_line and current_column for each new line
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the conditions for waiting for a new line and handling indentation, the function should now correctly consume the prefix string and produce the expected output.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and correctly handle prefix strings with various indentation and line break patterns.
