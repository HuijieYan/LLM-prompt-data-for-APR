The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation level of the comments. This is leading to the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.

The buggy function is not correctly handling the indentation of the comments due to which the `assertFormatEqual` test is failing. The error message clearly shows that the expected and actual output are not matching because the buggy function is not preserving the correct indentation of the comments.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` correctly handles the indentation of comments and preserves it while processing the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected function, when encountering a newline character, we append the current line to the `lines` and reset the `current_line` and `current_column` to preserve the correct indentation of the comments.

After making this correction, the function should now preserve the correct indentation of the comments and pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
