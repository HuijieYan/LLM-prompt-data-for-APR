### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is used to handle the indentation of comments in the Black formatter. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks whether the comments are indented correctly after a dedent. The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output due to incorrect comment indentation.

The GitHub issue confirms that when using tabs, the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. This aligns with the error encountered in the failing test case.

### Bug Location:
The bug likely lies in the logic that handles the indentation and whitespace characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It seems that the function is not effectively managing the whitespace and indentation when processing the input prefix.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function improperly handling the indentation level when processing the input prefix. This results in incorrect indentations for comments after a dedent, specifically when tabs are used in the input file.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be revisited. Specifically, the handling of whitespace characters, tabs, and newlines needs to be corrected to ensure that the correct indentation is maintained for comments after a dedent.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version simplifies the logic within the function to ensure that the correct indentation is maintained for comments after a dedent, regardless of whether tabs or spaces are used in the input file. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the failing test `test_comment_indentation` passes.
