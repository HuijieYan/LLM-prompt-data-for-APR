The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent." The function is likely used for processing indentation and may be causing issues with tabulated comments.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic involving the handling of tabs and indentation.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling tab characters and their impact on indentation, leading to incorrect formatting of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for handling tab characters and indentation in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            # incorrect indentation
            return '', prefix

        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            if (current_column + 1) % 4 != 0:
                current_column = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4
            else:
                current_column += 4
            current_line += ' ' * (current_column - len(current_line))
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return res, ''
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the logic for handling tab characters by converting them to spaces based on the current indentation level. We have also fixed the handling of new lines, ensuring that the indentation is preserved correctly.

This corrected version should address the issue of incorrectly changed indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
