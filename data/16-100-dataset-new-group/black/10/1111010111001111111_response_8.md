The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This is a known issue on GitHub and is related to the incorrect handling of tabulated indentation for comments after a dedent.

The bug in the function is likely caused by the handling of tabulated indentation and the condition for waiting for a newline. The function fails to correctly track the current column when encountering tab characters.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle tab characters for calculating the current column, and adjust the logic for waiting for a newline to ensure correct behavior for tabulated comments.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_column += 1
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function properly handles tab characters for calculating the current column and ensures correct behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent. With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
