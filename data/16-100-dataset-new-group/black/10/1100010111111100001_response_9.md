The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical error in handling the indentation levels and waiting for new lines. This might be causing the test case `test_comment_indentation` to fail due to incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the column-wise indentation. When the function encounters a new line while waiting for it, it is not properly resetting the current_line and current_column. This leads to issues in correct comparison with the expected output in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels, resets the current_line and current_column on encountering a new line, and returns the correct substring of the input based on the given column value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column >= column:
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = char
            
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

By implementing this corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`.
