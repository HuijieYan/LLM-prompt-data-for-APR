The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation of comments in the given codebase. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached, and then return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

### Error location:
1. The logic for handling tab characters and newlines seems to be incorrect, as it is not properly updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables.
2. The condition for returning the consumed prefix and remaining prefix may not be properly capturing the expected behavior.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters and newlines, leading to incorrect calculation of the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` values. This results in the function not correctly identifying when to return the consumed prefix and remaining prefix.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters and newlines to correctly update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables.
2. Adjust the condition for returning the consumed prefix and remaining prefix to accurately capture the expected behavior based on the input cases and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Adjusted condition
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # Include the current line when returning
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjusted calculation for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True  # Updated to set wait_for_nl for next line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the issues related to tab characters, newlines, and the condition for returning the consumed prefix and remaining prefix based on the input cases and the GitHub issue.
