## Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string and return the consumed part and the remaining part, based on a given column for indentation. The function has a complex logic involving indentation, spaces, tabs, and newlines.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the function in handling comments and their indentation, specifically in cases where tabs and spaces are used for indentation.

From the failing test, we can see that the expected behavior is not being achieved. The function is not correctly handling the comment indentation after a dedent.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the indentation of comments is changed incorrectly after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.

## Bug
The bug seems to be related to the logic for handling comments and indentation, specifically when dealing with tabs and spaces. The current implementation does not correctly identify and process the indentation levels, leading to incorrect behavior when handling comments.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling indentation and comments. We need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the indentation level, whether it's based on tabs or spaces, and processes the comments accordingly. 

## The corrected version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have made several changes to the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
1. Handling of newline character has been updated to include the current line in the `lines` list and reset `current_line` and `current_column` appropriately.
2. Updated the processing of tabs to assume 4 spaces per tab to align with the common indentation standards.
3. Minor updates to the conditionals to ensure correct handling of whitespace and comments.

This corrected version should address the issues with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent and align with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.
