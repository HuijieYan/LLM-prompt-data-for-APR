The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to the incorrect handling of indentation in the input prefix string. When encountering a newline character, the function is incorrectly identifying the start of a new line without considering the indentation level.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic to correctly calculate the indentation level for each line in the input prefix string and then compare it with the target column for partial consumption.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the equivalent number of spaces for tab characters
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset the indentation level for the new line
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation properly when consuming the input prefix string.

This modified version ensures that the indentation level is correctly calculated and considered when partial consuming the input prefix string. It should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
