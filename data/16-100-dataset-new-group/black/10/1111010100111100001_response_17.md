The buggy function contains an error in the logic that determines when a new line is detected and a new line of code should be added to the `lines` list. The function incorrectly checks for a newline character (`char == '\n'`) in the `wait_for_nl` block, which leads to the omission of a line when the indent is finished.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to insert a new line into the `lines` array. We should only add the `current_line` when the current column `< column` and we need to reset `current_line`, `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` when this is the case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    # this is the corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_column < column:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the `current_line` is concatenated in the `lines` list only when the current column is less than the given `column`. Additionally, the function resets the necessary variables to handle the next line of code.
