The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a portion of the prefix string based on a given column, while preserving the indentation of the remaining part. However, it fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.

The cause of the bug is that when encountering a comment after a dedent, the function incorrectly updates the current_column and does not properly handle the indentation. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling comments and indentation after a dedent in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # handle the case where comment is encountered after dedent
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The updated logic now correctly handles the indentation and comments after a dedent, ensuring that the correct indentation is preserved. This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
