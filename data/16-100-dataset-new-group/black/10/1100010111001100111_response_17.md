The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing the indentation to be incorrectly handled when the input string contains tab characters. It seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and the wait_for_nl flag within the function.

The bug causes incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent, particularly when the input file uses tabs.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic within the function and specifically address the handling of tab characters and indentation levels.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the handling of tab characters to ensure that the correct indentation levels are maintained. Additionally, we have adjusted the `wait_for_nl` flag and the logic related to it to address the issue with comment indentation after a dedent.

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for comments, particularly when tab characters are present in the input string, and pass the failing test.
