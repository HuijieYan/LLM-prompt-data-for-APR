Based on the runtime values and types of variables provided, it's apparent that the current implementation of the function is not correctly handling the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The issue reported on GitHub also aligns with the behavior observed in the buggy function, where the comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the indentation level when processing tabulated comments. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation level for tabulated comments and ensure that the comments are indented according to the input file's structure.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of tab characters ('\t') has been modified to correctly calculate the indentation level and ensure that the comments are properly aligned based on the input file's structure. This should resolve the indentation issue reported on GitHub.
