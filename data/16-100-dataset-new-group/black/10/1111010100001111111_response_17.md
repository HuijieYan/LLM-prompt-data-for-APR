Based on the runtime and expected values, the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation when encountering tabs or spaces in the input prefix in the _partially_consume_prefix function. The incorrect indentation behavior is likely causing the comments to be misaligned.

The bug can be fixed by updating the logic to correctly handle tabs and spaces in the input prefix and maintain consistent indentation.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling tab and space characters needs to be adjusted so that the indentation is maintained correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += ' '
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += '\t'
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the handling of spaces and tabs has been updated to maintain consistent indentation based on the column parameter. Now, the function should correctly handle the input prefix and maintain the expected indentation, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
