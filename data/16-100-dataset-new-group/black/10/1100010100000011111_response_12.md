The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation for comments. It is expected to return the remaining prefix after consuming the indentation, but it is not working as expected based on the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the handling of tab characters ('\t') and the computation of the current column. The function is not correctly updating the `current_column` when encountering tab characters and is not properly handling the indentation level for comments.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to accurately handle the tab characters and update the `current_column` accordingly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the handling of comments and indentation matches the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Update current_column for tab character
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        else:
            # Reset current_column when encountering non-indentation characters
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above correction, the function should now handle the tab characters and indentation correctly, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
