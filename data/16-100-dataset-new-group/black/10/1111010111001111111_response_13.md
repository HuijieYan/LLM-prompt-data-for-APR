To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles newlines and indentation. We'll update the function to properly handle the indentation and ensure that comments are aligned with the correct level of indentation.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    # Corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    else:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming the tab width is 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should handle the indentation and comments correctly, addressing the issue reported on GitHub. The function now properly tracks the indentation levels and handles comments after a dedent. This should resolve the problem and ensure that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output values.
