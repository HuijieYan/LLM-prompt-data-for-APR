The issue in the _partially_consume_prefix function is that it does not correctly handle the case when the current_line is not empty and the column is less than the desired column value, and a newline character is encountered. In this case, it should add the current line to the lines list and reset the current_line and current_column values, but it does not do that.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to properly handle the case when a newline character is encountered and the column condition is not met.

Here is the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line + '\n'
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fix should handle the case when a newline character is encountered and the column condition is not met, adding the current line to the lines list and resetting the current_line and current_column values.
