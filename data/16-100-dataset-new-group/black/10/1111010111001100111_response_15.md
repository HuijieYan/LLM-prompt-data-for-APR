The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior when handling tabulated comments after a dedent. This is resulting in incorrect indentation for comments past depth 0 after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the indentation levels when processing the prefix. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels and preserves the correct indentation for comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # assume tab width is 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the indentation levels properly and preserve the correct indentation for comments after a dedent. It should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the failing tests for comment indentation pass successfully.
