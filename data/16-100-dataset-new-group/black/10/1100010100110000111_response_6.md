### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly consuming the prefix and causing the indentation bug. There seems to be an issue with handling indentation and comments in the prefix.

### Potential error locations:
1. Handling of 'wait_for_nl' flag and newline characters.
2. Incorrectly processing the prefix and returning the result.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function does not correctly handle the indentation when encountering comments and does not accurately consume the prefix.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the `wait_for_nl` flag, newline characters, and indentation levels to ensure proper prefix consumption.
2. Take into account the position of comments in the prefix and adjust the logic accordingly.

### Corrected version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version of this function, the issue reported in the GitHub bug should be resolved, and the failing test should pass.
