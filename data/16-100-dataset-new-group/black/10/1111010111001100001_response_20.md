The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it is not correctly handling the indentation count based on spaces and tabs, which leads to incorrect results when consumed and returned as the result.

The issue is occurring due to the incomplete handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag. When `wait_for_nl` is set to `True`, it should check for the indentation level and consume the prefix accordingly. However, the current implementation fails to do so in some cases, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to track and update the current indentation level correctly and consume the prefix based on the specified column value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust current_column for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                # unexpected empty line
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected implementation, the function should now correctly handle the prefix consumption based on the specified column value, and the failing test should pass.
