The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is caused by the incorrect handling of the columns when processing tabs and spaces in the prefix string. This results in incorrect indentation when the input file uses tabs, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to properly track the column position when processing spaces and tabs, and then adjust the indentation of the comment accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        indent = ' ' * (column - current_column)
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res + indent, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Tabs are considered as 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function correctly calculates the indentation needed for the comment based on the column position and adjusts it accordingly. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
