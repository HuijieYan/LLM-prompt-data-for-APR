The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to incorrectly handle indentation for comments. It appears that the function is not correctly identifying the column at which the comments should be indented, especially after a dedent.

The problem arises from the fact that the function is not correctly resetting the `current_column` when encountering a new line or wait_for_nl is True. This results in incorrect indentation calculations, especially for cases where tabs are involved.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly reset the `current_column` when encountering a new line or when wait_for_nl is True, and also properly handle the indentation based on tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.expandtabs().strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation and comments correctly, especially when using tabs. It correctly resets the `current_column` and handles the indentation based on tabs.
