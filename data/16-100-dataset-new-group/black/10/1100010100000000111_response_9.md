## Fixing the Bug

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the issue of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is likely involved in the process of consuming the prefix and handling the indentation.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the logic for handling indentation with spaces and tabs, as well as the handling of new lines and the condition for checking if the indent is finished.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The function's logic for consuming the prefix and managing the current line, column, and new lines is not properly handling tabulated comments, causing the incorrect indentation issue reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent, specifically ensuring that the correct indentation is maintained for comments at different depths within the code.

## Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent_level = 0  # track the current indent level
    indent_stack = [(0, False)]  # stack to keep track of the indent levels and whether the indent is from a tab

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            if indent_stack[-1][1]:  # if the indent is from a tab
                current_column += 3
                indent_stack[-1] = (current_column, False)  # update the indent level
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            indent_stack.append((current_column, True))  # push the new indent level to the stack
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            indent_stack = [(0, False)]  # reset the indent stack
        else:
            # indent is finished
            while indent_stack[-1][0] > current_column:
                indent_stack.pop()  # pop the indent levels until the correct level is reached
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we added a stack to keep track of the indent levels and whether the indent is from a tab. We then updated the logic to handle the indentation based on both spaces and tabs, and to maintain the correct indentation for comments at different depths within the code.
