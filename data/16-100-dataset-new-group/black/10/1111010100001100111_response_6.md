Based on the description of the GitHub issue and the runtime values of the variables provided, it seems that the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of tab characters and their impact on indentation levels. When encountering tab characters, the function is not adjusting the current column properly, leading to incorrect handling of the indentation and comments.

To fix the bug, I would suggest updating the function to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the current column based on the tab size. This would ensure that the function accurately determines the correct column for the given prefix and handles the comments and indentation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        tab_size = 4  # Assuming standard tab size is 4 spaces
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                spaces_to_add = tab_size - (current_column % tab_size)
                current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
                current_column += spaces_to_add
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated version of the function correctly handles tab characters by calculating the number of spaces needed to reach the next tab stop and adjusting the current column accordingly. This ensures that the function accurately determines the indentation levels for the given prefix and properly handles comments and indentation.

By making these changes, the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent should be resolved.
