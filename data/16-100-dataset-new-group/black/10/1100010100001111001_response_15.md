The issue with the provided function lies in the incomplete handling of the indentation and newline characters. The function is meant to consume a prefix string up to a given column value, splitting it into two parts. However, it fails to accurately calculate the indentation level and incorrectly handles newlines.

To fix this, the function needs to accurately track the indentation level and correctly handle newlines, spaces, and tabs according to the indentation level specified by the 'column' parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now accurately handle the indentation level and correctly split the prefix string into two parts.
