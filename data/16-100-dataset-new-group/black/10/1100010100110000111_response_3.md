## Strategy for fixing the bug:

The bug seems to be related to the handling of tabs and spaces during indentation. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation of the code, and the issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

The corrected version of the function should accurately determine the correct indentation level and apply it to the comments after a dedent, regardless of whether the input file uses tabs or spaces for indentation.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent_level = 0  # Track the current indentation level
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                indent_level = 0  # Reset the indentation level after a new line
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            if indent_level > 0:  # Adjust the current_column based on the indentation level
                current_column += (indent_level - 1)
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            if indent_level > 0:  # Adjust the current_column based on the indentation level
                current_column += (3 * (indent_level - 1))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            indent_level = 0  # Reset the indentation level after a new line
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == '#':
                indent_level = current_column  # Track the indentation level for comments

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now includes handling the `indent_level` to accurately track the indentation level for comments after a dedent regardless of whether the input file uses tabs or spaces. This approach should resolve the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
