The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to partially consume the prefix string based on a given column value. The function iterates through each character in the prefix string and updates the current line and column values accordingly.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect handling of newline characters.
2. Incorrect comparison of the current column with the specified column.

The cause of the bug is that the current logic does not properly handle the indentation when consuming the prefix string.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly track the indentation level and consume the prefix string based on the specified column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the prefix indentation correctly and pass the failing test.
