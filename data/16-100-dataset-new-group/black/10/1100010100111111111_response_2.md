The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior in terms of comment indentation. The function is responsible for partially consuming a prefix of a given string based on a column value. However, it fails to handle the indentation for comments correctly, especially when the input string uses tabs for indentation.

The cause of the bug lies in the logic for handling white spaces and tab characters, which leads to incorrect indentation calculation for comments.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic of handling white spaces and tabs, particularly when encountering comments, to ensure the correct calculation of indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles the indentation for comments, especially when the input string uses tabs for indentation. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
