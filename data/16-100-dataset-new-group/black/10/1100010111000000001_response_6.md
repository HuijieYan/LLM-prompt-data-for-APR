## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation level and waiting for a newline character, affecting the formatting of the code.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of indentation levels.
2. Incorrect detection of newline characters and empty lines.
3. Incomplete tracking of the consumed prefix.

## Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to consume the prefix incorrectly, leading to incorrect formatting of the code in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic to accurately track the indentation level.
2. Properly handle tabs, spaces, and newline characters.
3. Ensure that the consumed prefix is correctly tracked and returned.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                stripped_line = current_line.strip()
                if stripped_line and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_column += 1
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
