The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix of a text and return the consumed prefix along with the remaining text. The function has several conditional checks and logic for handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and new lines.

Upon analyzing the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it appears that the function is not correctly handling indentation and new lines, leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent, especially in cases where the input file uses tabs.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and new lines, as well as the condition for checking the column number with respect to the current line.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly maintaining the indentation level and handling new lines after a dedent, especially in cases where tabs are being used as the indentation character. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation and new lines when consuming the prefix. Specifically, the logic for tracking the current column and handling new lines needs to be adjusted to properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling tabs has been updated to increment the `current_column` by 4 spaces for each tab character. Additionally, the condition for handling new lines has been adjusted to correctly check the current column and return the consumed prefix along with the remaining text.

These modifications aim to address the issue described in the GitHub report and ensure that the function correctly handles tabulated comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.
