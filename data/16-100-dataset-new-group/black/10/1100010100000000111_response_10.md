Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The logic for handling tabs and spaces might be incorrect.
2. The handling of newlines and the indentation level might be faulty.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function is not correctly handling the indentation levels and the presence of tabs in the input code. This leads to incorrect reformatting of the comments after a dedent, as described in the GitHub issue.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the logic for handling tabs and spaces to ensure consistent indentation.
2. Adjust the logic for tracking the current column and lines to accurately represent the input code's structure.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, the logic for handling tabs and spaces, as well as the newlines and indentation level, has been revised to accurately track and maintain the input code's structure. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
