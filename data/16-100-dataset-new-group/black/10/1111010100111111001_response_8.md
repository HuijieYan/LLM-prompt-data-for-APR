The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it is not correctly detecting the lines and columns in the prefix string. The function is failing to keep track of indentation when encountering space characters or tabs, which causes it to incorrectly identify the end of lines and columns.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to keep track of the current column correctly, considering both spaces and tabs as well as new lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
            else:
                current_line += char
                if current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
