To fix the bug in the function _partially_consume_prefix, we need to address the incorrect handling of spaces and tabs in the input prefix. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix string up to a specified column, but it does not handle tab characters correctly, resulting in incorrect indentation.

After reviewing the failing test and the expected input/output values, it is clear that the function should correctly handle tab characters and maintain the correct indentation for comments.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of tab characters in the prefix string, leading to incorrect calculation of indentation and incorrect partial consumption of the prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle tab characters and calculate the indentation based on the tab width. We can accomplish this by replacing each tab character ('\t') with the equivalent number of spaces (assuming a standard tab width of 4 spaces), and then treating the resulting string as if it consists only of spaces.

Here is the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate the number of spaces needed to reach the next tab stop
                current_column += spaces_to_add
                current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add  # Replace tab with equivalent spaces
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    # unexpected empty line
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, it should now properly handle tab characters, calculate correct indentation, and consume the prefix string up to the specified column. This should address the indentation issue with tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.
