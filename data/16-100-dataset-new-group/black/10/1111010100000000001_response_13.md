## Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is trying to consume a prefix string up to a specified column and return the consumed prefix along with the remaining part of the prefix. However, there are potential error locations within the function:
1. The handling of newline characters is not correct.
2. The logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables seems to be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the function is caused by incorrect handling of newline characters and the logic for consuming the prefix up to a specified column. This leads to the incorrect extraction of the consumed prefix.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the newline characters and the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables. Additionally, we need to ensure that the consumed prefix is correctly extracted up to the specified column.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)  # Include the current line in the consumed prefix
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    current_column = 0
                    current_line = ""  # Reset the current line
                    wait_for_nl = False
        if not wait_for_nl:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)  # Include the current line in the consumed prefix
                current_line = ""  # Reset the current line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_line += char
    # Handle the case when the prefix is consumed completely
    if current_line and current_column < column:
        lines.append(current_line)  # Include the current line in the consumed prefix
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

In the corrected version, we have fixed the logic for handling newline characters, updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables, and ensured that the consumed prefix is correctly extracted up to the specified column.
