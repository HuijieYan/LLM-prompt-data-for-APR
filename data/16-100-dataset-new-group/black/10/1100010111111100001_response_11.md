The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it is not handling whitespace characters properly, resulting in incorrect indentation levels being detected for the lines.

The following steps need to be taken to fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the number of spaces and tabs and adjusts the column count accordingly.
2. Check for proper handling of newline characters and empty lines to accurately determine the current indentation level.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle whitespace characters and indentations properly, which will allow it to pass the failing test.
