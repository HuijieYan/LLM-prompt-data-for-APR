The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is caused by an incorrect handling of column indentation. The function is supposed to remove whitespace characters at the beginning of a prefix string, up to a specified column value.

However, the current implementation incorrectly handles the indentation by not considering the number of spaces or tabs, which leads to the incorrect removal of whitespace characters and the incorrect use of the wait_for_nl flag.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle indentation for spaces and tabs, and update the current column value based on the type of indentation characters encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    indent = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            indent += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            indent += 4
        else:
            current_line += " " * indent + char
            current_column += indent
            indent = 0
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected implementation correctly handles the indentation of spaces and tabs, updates the current column value, and correctly appends lines based on the column value. It should now pass the failing test cases provided.
