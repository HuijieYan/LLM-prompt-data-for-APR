The buggy function is supposed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. However, it fails to reset the current_line and current_column variables correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

The issue occurs when the wait_for_nl flag is set to True, and the function encounters a newline character. In this case, the function should reset the current_line and current_column, but it fails to do so, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the current_line and current_column variables are properly reset when a newline character is encountered and the wait_for_nl flag is True.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
