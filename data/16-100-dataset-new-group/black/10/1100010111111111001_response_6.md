The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error that causes it to incorrectly handle lines with leading whitespace, resulting in mismatched outputs and failing the test case `test_comment_indentation`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the prefix string when it contains multiple lines and indentation characters. The function `wait_for_nl` flag is not appropriately handled, leading to the incorrect accumulation of characters in the `current_line` variable.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the cases where the prefix contains multiple lines and varying levels of indentation. We can achieve this by revising the logic of how characters are processed and stored in the `current_line` and `lines` variables.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            # End of indentation, save current line and reset
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False

        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Newline encountered, reset column count
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # Non-whitespace characters
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` and satisfy the expected input/output values.
