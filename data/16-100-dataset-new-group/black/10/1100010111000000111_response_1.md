The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent. This is causing the test function `test_comment_indentation` to fail and is also the reason behind the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent".

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly keeping track of the current column while iterating through the input prefix string. When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function is not properly handling the indentation, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle indentation and comments after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # increment current_column by the number of spaces until the next tab stop
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent and pass the failing test. Additionally, it should also resolve the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent".
