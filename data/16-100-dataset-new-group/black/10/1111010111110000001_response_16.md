The issue in the `Driver` class method `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it doesn't handle the indentation correctly when converting tabs to spaces. This causes the failing test to produce a mismatch between the expected and actual output, resulting in an `AssertionError`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the conversion of tabs to spaces and ensure that the indentation is preserved in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                spaces_remaining = 4 - (len(current_line) - current_column % 4)
                current_line += " " * spaces_remaining
                current_column += spaces_remaining
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
                
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the conversion of tabs to spaces and preserve the indentation, ensuring that the failing test passes successfully.
