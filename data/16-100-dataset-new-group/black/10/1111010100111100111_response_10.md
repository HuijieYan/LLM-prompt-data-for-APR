The issue with the buggy function is that it fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to handle the indentation and consume the prefix based on the given column. However, it doesn't properly handle the indentation of comments, leading to incorrect results.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the logic related to handling indentation and consuming the prefix based on the column.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. It fails to maintain the proper alignment of comments when dedenting, causing the formatting issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle the indentation of comments and preserve the alignment when dedenting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:  # char is '\t'
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I've updated the logic to properly handle spaces and tabs for indentation. Additionally, I've added a case to correctly handle newline characters and preserve the alignment of comments when dedenting. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix based on the given column.
