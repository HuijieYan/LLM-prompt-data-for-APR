The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect behavior in the indentation of comments after a dedent. The function is not properly handling the indentation and newline characters, leading to incorrect formatting of the comments.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the logic for updating the current line, column, and waiting for a newline.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly track the column position and handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect formatting of the comments, as observed in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the column position and handle the indentation for comments based on the input prefix and column values. It should properly handle spaces, tabs, and newlines while updating the current line and column position.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and newline characters, producing the expected output for the failing test cases. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.
