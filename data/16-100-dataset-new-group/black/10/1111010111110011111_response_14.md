To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. We will also take into account the use of tabs in the input file.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4
            elif char == '#':  # Handle comments
                if current_column < column:  # Check if comment is at the expected column
                    wait_for_nl = True
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True  # Assume it's the start of new code

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The changes made include handling tab indentation and checking the position of comments relative to the expected column. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.

With these changes, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue.
