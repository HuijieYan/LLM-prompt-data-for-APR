The bug in this function lies in the condition for checking if the current line being constructed ends with a newline character. If it does, the function should then check if the current column is less than the specified column and consume the prefix accordingly, but it doesn't happen as expected in some cases.

The cause of the bug is that when a tab character is encountered, it is incorrectly adding 4 to the current column count.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly handle tab characters such that they are counted as only 1 column, not 4, and also ensure that the correct conditions are checked to consume the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Count tab as only 1 column
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
