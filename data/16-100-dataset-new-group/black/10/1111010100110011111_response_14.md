To fix the bug in the given function, we need to address the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The function _partially_consume_prefix is responsible for handling the prefix of the input text, and it needs to correctly handle the indentation of comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation of comments when there is a dedent. This is evident from the failing test case, where the comments are not properly aligned after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the _partially_consume_prefix function to correctly handle the indentation of comments, especially after a dedent. We should ensure that the indentation of comments is maintained correctly based on the input indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char in [' ', '\t']:
                current_column += 4 if char == '\t' else 1
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments, ensuring that they are aligned properly after a dedent. The function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrectly changing the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
