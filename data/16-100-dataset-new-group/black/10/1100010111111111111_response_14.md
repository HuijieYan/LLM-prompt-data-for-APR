Based on the provided information, the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the indentation level for comments after a dedent in the input prefix. This causes the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to produce incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't properly track the column position when encountering a comment after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately update the column position when encountering a comment and handle the indentation level correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for index, char in enumerate(prefix):
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if index < len(prefix) - 1:
                next_char = prefix[index + 1]
                if next_char == '\t':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_column = 0
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
            else:
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles the indentations properly, ensuring that comments are correctly aligned based on the column input.

After applying the fix, the function should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it handles various edge cases correctly and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
