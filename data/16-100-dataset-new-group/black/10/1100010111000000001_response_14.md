The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to how it handles whitespace and newlines. The function is used to consume whitespace in a prefix string up to a specified column. The bug may be causing incorrect handling of newlines or incorrect indentation detection.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect handling of newlines and whitespace
2. Incorrect calculation of indentation levels

The cause of the bug may be that the function is not properly detecting and handling the indentation levels in the prefix string, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the indentation levels, handle newlines and whitespace correctly, and ensure that the prefix is partially consumed up to the specified column.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                # consume the whitespace and carry over the current line
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # increment column until a newline or indentation
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
