## Correction:

The cause of the bug is that when the function encounters a newline character, it resets the current_column to 0, regardless of whether there is an indentation level or not.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current_column is only reset to 0 if there is no indent before the newline character.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # reset current_column only if there is no indent
                if current_line.strip() == '':
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation level when encountering newline characters and the failing tests should pass.
