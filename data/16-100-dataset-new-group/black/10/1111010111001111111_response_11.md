The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation correctly when there are tab characters and comments in the input. This is causing the reformatting issue described in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling tab characters and their effect on the column count. When encountering a tab character, the function should increment the `current_column` by 4, but it is currently only incrementing it by 1.

To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of tab characters to properly increment the `current_column` by 4 and adjust the logic around indentation and comments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle tab characters and comments properly, and the failing test should pass. This will also resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
