The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value and return the consumed part as well as the remaining prefix. However, there are several issues in the current implementation:

1. The logic for tracking the newline characters and handling indentation seems to be incorrect, as evidenced by the failing test case for comment indentation.

2. The function does not handle cases where the prefix string is completely consumed, and it should return the consumed prefix as well as an empty string for the remaining prefix.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the indentation level and newline characters in the prefix string and also ensure that it returns the correct consumed part and remaining prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for i, char in enumerate(prefix):
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[i + 1:]  # Return the consumed part and the remaining prefix
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset the current column count and start looking for the next indentation level
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line  # Return the consumed part and the remaining prefix
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test case for comment indentation and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
