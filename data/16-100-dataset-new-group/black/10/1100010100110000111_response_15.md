## Analysis
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is used to handle the indentation in the Python code, and it seems to be misbehaving when dealing with tab characters and comment lines.

## Potential Error Locations
The buggy function seems to have issues with handling tab characters, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. It also fails to correctly handle the indentation of comment lines after a dedent.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle tab characters and comment lines correctly. This leads to incorrect indentation when there is a comment line after a dedent in the input file using tabs.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab characters and comment lines.
2. Verify the function against a test case that involves tab characters and comment lines to ensure the indentation is maintained correctly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    last_char = ''
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if last_char in ['\t', ' ']:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
        last_char = char

    res = ''.join(lines)
    if res and prefix.startswith(res):
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return '', prefix
