The root cause of the bug is that the conditional for checking the indentation level is not being triggered correctly. This leads to incorrect behavior when the function encounters a comment line, resulting in inconsistent indentation levels in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to carefully track the current column position, and correctly identify when an indent is finished or when a new line has started. We also need to properly handle the case when the function encounters a comment line.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and comment line cases, resulting in consistent behavior and passing the failing test.
