The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing an assertion error in the failing test case. The function is used to partially consume a prefix and return the consumed part of the prefix along with the remaining part.

The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments in the input `prefix`. This is evident from the assertion error message which shows a mismatch in the indentation of comments.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for comments and updates the variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` based on the character being processed from the `prefix`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the indentation and comments properly, and it should pass the failing test case.
