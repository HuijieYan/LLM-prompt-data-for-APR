In the provided buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, the issue lies in how the function handles and processes the input `prefix`. The function is intended to partially consume and return a prefix, but it is not properly handling various cases involving indentation and newline characters.

The bugs in the function are related to how it handles white spaces, tab characters, and newline characters when determining the appropriate indentation level and current column count.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` likely exposes these bugs, causing the function to return incorrect results for some input cases. The error message indicates that the expected result does not match the actual result for some test cases. Specifically, the comment indentation is not being handled correctly, leading to the mismatch between the expected and actual result.

To fix the bug, you can review the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to ensure it correctly handles white spaces, tab characters, and newline characters, and properly maintains the indentation level based on the specified column. Debugging the function with a variety of inputs and visualizing the intermediate state of variables may help in identifying and resolving the issues.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust the tab width based on the requirements
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column == column:
                break
            current_column += 1
    
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the handling of white spaces, tab characters, and newline characters to correctly calculate the indentation level and column count. It should now pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and satisfy the expected input/output values.
