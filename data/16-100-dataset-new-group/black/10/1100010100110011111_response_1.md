Based on the provided error message and the expected input/output values, it seems that the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the tab indentation correctly when processing comments. This is causing the incorrect reformatting of the comments after a dedent.

The issue on GitHub also confirms that the problem occurs when the input file uses tabs for indentation.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the handling of tab characters and the calculation of the `current_column` variable.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly account for tab characters when calculating the column position, causing incorrect handling of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the column position accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_space = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += tab_space
            current_line += ' ' * tab_space
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle tab characters properly and calculate the column position correctly, ensuring that comments are indented correctly after a dedent.

This should address the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
