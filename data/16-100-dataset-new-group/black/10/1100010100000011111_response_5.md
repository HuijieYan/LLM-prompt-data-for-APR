## Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a given prefix string, splitting it into two parts based on a specified indentation level. However, there are issues in the logic of the function that result in incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The logic for handling `wait_for_nl` and the condition for determining when to split the prefix into parts may not be correct.
2. The handling of different types of indentation characters (`' '`, `'\t'`) may not be properly accounted for.

## Cause of the Bug
The buggy function does not correctly handle the indentation levels when processing the prefix string, causing incorrect splitting of the prefix and affecting the indentation of comments after a dedent. This is the cause of the issue reported on GitHub.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the different types of indentation characters (`' '`, `'\t'`) and adjust the logic for splitting the prefix based on the specified column level.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab, adjust as needed
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the condition for handling `'\n'` characters have been adjusted to properly reset the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags. Additionally, the handling of `'\t'` characters has been updated to add the appropriate number of spaces to the `current_column`.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
