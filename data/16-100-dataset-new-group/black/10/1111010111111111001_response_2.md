The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the logic for handling indents and newlines is incorrect, leading to incorrect line splitting when prefixing with white spaces and tab characters.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling indentation, whitespace, and newline characters in the prefix string. Specifically, we need to correctly track the current column position and handle cases where indentation changes occur.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char != ' ' and char != '\t' and char != '\n':
                    # indentation is finished
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # regular character
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            
            if current_column >= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test cases and accurately handle prefix strings with indentation, whitespace, and newline characters.
