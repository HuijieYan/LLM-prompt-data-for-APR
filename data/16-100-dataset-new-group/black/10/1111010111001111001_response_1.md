The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error in its implementation. Specifically, the function incorrectly handles the indentation levels and the number of spaces or tabs in the input `prefix`. The issue arises when computing the `current_column` based on different types of whitespace characters, and when checking if the `wait_for_nl` condition is met. Based on the failing test, the function fails to properly identify the correct level of indentation and to accumulate the lines before the comment.

To fix the bug, the function should properly parse the prefix, considering each whitespace character differently and accurately tracking the indentation level. Additionally, the function should correctly handle the presence of comments and newlines in the prefix.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the indentation levels and whitespace characters, ensuring that the prefix is correctly processed to fulfill the expected output.
