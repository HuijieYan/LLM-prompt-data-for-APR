After analyzing the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` and its relationship with the `Driver` class and the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the potential error locations within the function are related to how it processes the input prefix.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment in the input prefix, leading to incorrect indentation in the output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the current column and handle the indentation level based on tab and space characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should handle the indentation level accurately and pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
