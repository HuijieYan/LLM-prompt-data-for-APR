The cause of the bug is that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not handle the indentation properly for comments. It incorrectly consumes the prefix and does not preserve the correct column indentation for comments. This results in incorrect indentation after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation for comments and preserve the correct column indentation. We can achieve this by tracking the column indentation and ensuring that the comments are properly aligned with the code.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_line.strip().startswith("#"):
                current_column = 0  # Reset column for comments
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should properly handle the indentation for comments and preserve the correct column indentation, ultimately resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
