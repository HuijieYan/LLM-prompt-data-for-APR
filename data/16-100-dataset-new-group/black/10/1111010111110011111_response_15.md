To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, we need to make sure that the handling of whitespace and newline characters is correctly updating the current_column and wait_for_nl variables. We also need to ensure that the lines list is properly updated when encountering a '\n' character.

In the buggy function, there are a few potential error locations. One key area to investigate is the handling of indentation and newline characters. Additionally, there might be issues with how the current_line variable is being updated and whether the wait_for_nl flag is being set/reset appropriately.

The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of indentation and newline characters. This results in the current_column and wait_for_nl variables not being updated correctly, leading to incorrect output when formatting the input code. This is consistent with the error message indicating a discrepancy in the expected and actual output for the test cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the _partially_consume_prefix function to correctly update the current_column and wait_for_nl variables based on the encountered characters. We also need to update the lines list when a newline character is encountered. By doing so, we can ensure that the function handles indentation and newline characters properly, resolving the formatting issue.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should properly handle the indentation and newline characters, resulting in the expected output for the failing test cases. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug, ensuring that the code formatting behaves consistently for input files using tabs.
