The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing unexpected behavior due to the mishandling of the wait_for_nl variable. The function is not properly resetting the current_line and current_column variables when encountering a newline character (\n), and it is not checking the column value correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling newline characters and properly update the wait_for_nl, current_line, and current_column variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                        wait_for_nl = True
                else:
                    if char == ' ':
                        current_column += 1
                    elif char == '\t':
                        current_column += 4
                    else:
                        wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles the newline characters and updates the current_line and current_column variables according to the specified column value. It also fixes the logic for resetting the wait_for_nl variable. This should now satisfy all the expected test cases.
