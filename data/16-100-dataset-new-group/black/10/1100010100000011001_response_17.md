The bug in the function is that it is not properly handling the case where the wait_for_nl flag is set to True. 

When wait_for_nl is True, the function is not properly handling the case when the character is a newline. The expected behavior should be to reset the current_line and current_column, and append the line to the lines list. 

To fix the bug, we can update the code inside the `if wait_for_nl:` block to properly handle the reset of current_line and current_column, and append the line to the lines list when a newline character is encountered.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
            lines.append('\n')
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
