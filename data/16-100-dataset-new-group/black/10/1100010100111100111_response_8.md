The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect behavior when handling tabulated comments after a dedent. The function doesn't properly handle the indentation level of comments, resulting in incorrect formatting.

The bug is caused by the function not properly considering the column parameter when processing the prefix. This leads to incorrect handling of the comment indentation, especially when using tabs instead of spaces.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the indentation level based on the column parameter and adjust the prefix accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            current_column = len(current_line.expandtabs())
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles the indentation level using both spaces and tabs, making sure to adjust the prefix based on the column parameter. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and resolve the failing test as well.
