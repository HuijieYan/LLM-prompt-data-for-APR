The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class and is responsible for processing a prefix string and handling the indentation based on a given column.

Upon analyzing the function and its relationship with the failing tests and GitHub issue, it seems that the issue is related to incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent. The function fails to correctly adjust the indentation for comments, especially when the input file uses tabs.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for handling indentation, especially the `wait_for_nl` condition and the calculation of `current_column`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect formatting of the code. This is reflected in the failing tests and the GitHub issue report, where the comment indentation is being changed incorrectly after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation and comments needs to be revisited. Specifically, the code needs to correctly handle the indentation level when encountering comments and adjust it based on the column value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char in [' ', '\t']:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, the logic for handling indentation and comments has been improved. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing tests pass successfully.
