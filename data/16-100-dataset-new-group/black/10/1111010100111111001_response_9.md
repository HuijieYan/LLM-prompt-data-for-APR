The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case where the indentation is followed by a comment at the same level of indentation as the line. This causes the comment to be considered as part of the indentation and to not be stripped.

To fix this, we can modify the logic to properly handle comments at the same level of indentation as the line. We should only consider the indentation level when encountering whitespace characters, not when waiting for a new line or when a new line character is encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                    current_line += char
    
    lines.append(current_line)
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle comments at the same level of indentation as the line, and the failing tests should pass.
