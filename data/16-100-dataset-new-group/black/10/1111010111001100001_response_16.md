The cause of the bug lies in the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is intended to consume a given prefix until a certain column limit, and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, the function is not handling the case where the column limit is reached on a newline character, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the column limit when encountering newline characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:  # Check if the column limit is reached
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Check if current line is not empty and column limit is reached
                if current_line.strip():
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this fix, the updated `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test.
