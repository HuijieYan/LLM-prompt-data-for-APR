The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from how it handles the indentation level before a comment in the `prefix` string. When encountering a comment, it incorrectly keeps the current line and adds the comment to it, resulting in the incorrect indentation.

To fix this bug, we can update the function to correctly handle the indentation level before a comment and ensure that the comment is added at the correct indent level.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version ensures that the indentation level before a comment is correctly handled. It correctly tracks the current column and appends the comment at the correct indentation level, which should resolve the failing test case.
