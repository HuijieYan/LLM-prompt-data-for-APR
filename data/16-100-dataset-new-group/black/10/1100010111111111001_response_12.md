The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect logic for handling the indentation level of the prefix. When checking for whitespace characters, the function incorrectly adds the whitespace count to the current column, even if the whitespace is within a prefix line. This leads to an incorrect indentation count and mishandles prefix lines.

To fix this bug, the function should only increment the column count when the indentation is finished.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # only add non-empty lines
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
