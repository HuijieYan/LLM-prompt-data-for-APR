The root cause of the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it doesn't correctly handle the indentation level for comments in the input code. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

The buggy function incorrectly identifies the position of the comment's indentation, leading to incorrect results. This is evident from the runtime input/output values provided in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for comments and accurately identifies the position of the comment's indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # assuming a tab width of 4 spaces
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += tab_width
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_column = 0
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, I've made the following changes:
1. Added a `tab_width` variable to handle tab indentation correctly.
2. Updated the conditions to handle tabs and spaces correctly for incrementing the `current_column`.
3. Adjusted the logic for handling the newline condition.

With these changes, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the indentation for comments correctly and pass the failing test cases.
