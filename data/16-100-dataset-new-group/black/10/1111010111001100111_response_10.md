Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output variable values, it seems that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function has a bug related to handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. The function is not correctly handling the indentation and alignment of comments in the input code.

The bug is likely caused by the logic within the `wait_for_nl` conditional block. This block is responsible for checking indentation and handling new lines, tabs, spaces, and comments. It appears that the logic in this block is not correctly handling the cases where comments are indented after a dedent.

To fix this bug, we can revise the logic within the `wait_for_nl` conditional block to properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column//4 + 1) * 4  # handling tab indentation
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

In the corrected version, we have revised the logic to properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, ensuring that comments are indented correctly in the output.

With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
