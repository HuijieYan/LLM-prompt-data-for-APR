Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function and the failing test error message, it is clear that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the prefix text and the column indentation.

The buggy function is not correctly updating the `current_line` and `lines` variables, which causes the incorrect behavior. It fails to properly identify and store lines with comments that should be skipped and not included in the return value.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle cases where comments are present within the prefix text and handle the indentation and newline characters according to the specified column positions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
    return '\n'.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

The corrected version of the function now properly handles the prefix, column indentation, and newlines. It updates the `lines` list with the correctly indented lines from the prefix and skips the comment lines based on the specified column.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
