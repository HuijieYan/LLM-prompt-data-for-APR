The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` and it seems to be manipulating the prefix string in some way based on the current indentation column. The function is designed to consume part of the prefix string based on the indentation level.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be related to the logic for handling indentation levels, specifically when encountering spaces, tabs, and newlines.

The failing test function `test_comment_indentation` is checking whether the `contents_tab` and `contents_spc` are being formatted correctly. The function checks both tab and space indentation contents. 

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of the indentation in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, causing the incorrect formatting of the contents and leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to ensure that it correctly handles indentation levels and consumes the prefix string based on the indentation columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    tabs_to_spaces = 4  # assuming tab is equal to 4 spaces

    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == '\t':
            num_spaces = tabs_to_spaces - (current_column % tabs_to_spaces)
            if current_column + num_spaces <= column:
                current_line += " " * num_spaces
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test.
