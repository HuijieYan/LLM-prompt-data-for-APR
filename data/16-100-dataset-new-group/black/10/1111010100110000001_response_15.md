The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely responsible for the failing test. The purpose of this function is to consume a prefix string up to a specified column number. However, the function does not seem to handle tab characters correctly, resulting in incorrect indentation.

The potential error locations within the function include the tab character and the logic for handling indentation levels.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the mishandling of tab characters, which causes the incorrect identification of the current column. This leads to incorrect line generation and ultimately the function returns the wrong result.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly handle tab characters by updating the logic for calculating the current column when encountering a tab.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_width = 4
            padding = tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            current_line += ' ' * padding
            current_column += padding
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles tab characters correctly, calculates the correct column position, and generates the lines accordingly. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
