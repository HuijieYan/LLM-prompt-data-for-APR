## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Change from 4 to 8 for consistent tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add the current line to the lines list
            current_line = ""  # Reset current_line
            current_column = 0  # Reset current column
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]  # Fix the return value to include the remaining prefix
```

The cause of the bug:
1. The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of tab characters. In the original function, when encountering a tab character, the current_column is incremented by 4, which assumes a tab width of 4 spaces. However, the actual tab width is 8 spaces.
2. Additionally, the logic for handling newlines and adding the current line to the lines list is incorrect.

To fix the bug:
1. Change the increment for tab characters from 4 to 8 to match the actual tab width.
2. Fix the logic for handling newlines and adding the current line to the lines list.

The corrected version of the function addresses both of these issues and is expected to pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
