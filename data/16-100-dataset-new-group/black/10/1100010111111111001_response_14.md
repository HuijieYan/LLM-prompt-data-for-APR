## Buggy function analysis
Based on the failing test and error message, the `assertFormatEqual` method is producing an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual output. The failing test is related to formatting indentation, and the error message shows the specific differences between the expected and actual outputs.

The `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation of comments within the prefix string, resulting in incorrect formatting and causing the failing test.

## Bug in the function
The bug lies in how the function handles the indentation and newlines within the `prefix` string. When encountering a comment indentation, the function does not correctly handle the whitespace and ends up producing an incorrect new prefix string, leading to the failing test.

The failing test specifically checks the comment indentation output, so it is essential to ensure that the function correctly handles the whitespace and comment positioning.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately consume the prefix string, taking into account the indentation and newlines when encountering comments. It should ensure that the resulting prefix string preserves the correct formatting, including the comments and their respective indentations.

A potential strategy would be to track the indentation levels and handle comments as special cases, ensuring that the resulting prefix string maintains the correct formatting and indentation for comments.

## Corrected function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
The corrected function includes handling newline characters properly and maintains the correct formatting for comments and their indentations in the resulting prefix string. By fixing the indentation tracking and newline handling, the function should now produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
