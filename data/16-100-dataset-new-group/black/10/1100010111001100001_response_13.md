The bug in the provided function seems to be the logic for handling indentation levels and line breaks. It is not correctly identifying the line and column number for a given input string.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to properly track the line number and column number while processing the input string. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function handles cases for empty strings and correctly identifies the end of the input string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = ['']
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
            
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
        
        if current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            if res.strip():
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
