## Potential Errors:
1. The variable `lines` is being used inside the loop, but it is not being reset after the loop completes.
2. The condition for checking if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column is incorrect.
3. The function does not handle the case where the last line of the prefix is not empty.

## Cause of the bug:
The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a specified column and return the consumed portion along with the remaining string. However, there are several logic errors within the function that prevent it from working correctly. 

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reset the `lines` variable after the loop completes.
2. Adjust the condition for checking the current line and column.
3. Handle the case where the last line of the prefix is not empty.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
