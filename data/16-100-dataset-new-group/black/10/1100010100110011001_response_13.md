The bug in the function is causing an indentation error in the output. The function is incorrectly handling the indentation and newline characters in the input prefix. This is resulting in incorrect indentation in the output, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly identify the indentation level and newlines in the input prefix and handle them accordingly. It should also properly update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables to ensure correct handling of the input prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = True  # Set to True to handle initial indentation correctly
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char in [' ', '\t']:  # Skip leading whitespace
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif wait_for_nl and char == '\n':  # Handle newline and reset indentation
            lines.append(current_line + char)  # Add current line to lines
            current_line = ""  # Reset current_line
            current_column = 0  # Reset current_column
        else:
            current_line += char  # Add character to current_line
            wait_for_nl = False  # Set to False so subsequent leading whitespace is not skipped

    # Add the remaining content to lines
    lines.append(current_line)

    # Build the result string by joining the lines
    res = ''.join(lines)

    # Return the result and the remaining prefix
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output values should be satisfied.
