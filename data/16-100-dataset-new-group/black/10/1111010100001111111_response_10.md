To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The issue on GitHub indicates that the indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent when using the Black library on a codebase that uses tabs.

The problem in the buggy function is that the logic for handling tabulated comments after a dedent is flawed. We can see this by the incorrect handling of the tab characters and new lines, resulting in incorrect indentation levels for comments.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling tab characters and new lines within the `prefix`. Specifically, we should ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is correctly set and reset when encountering specific characters such as tab, space, or new line. Additionally, we need to update the `current_column` and `lines` variables appropriately to maintain the correct indentation for comments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the logic for handling tab characters by adjusting the `current_column` based on the existing column value. This ensures that the correct level of indentation is maintained for tabulated comments after a dedent.

By making these changes, we address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
