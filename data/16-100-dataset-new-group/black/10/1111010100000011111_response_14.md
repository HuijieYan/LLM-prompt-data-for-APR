The bug in the provided function seems to be related to handling the indentation level of comments after a dedent. The function appears to be incorrectly updating the current column and not properly handling tab characters, resulting in incorrectly formatted comments. The bug likely causes the comments to be improperly adjusted after dedent, leading to the issue reported in the GitHub post.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the indentation and tab characters when processing the prefix input.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += ' '
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += '\t'
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the indentation and tab characters, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
