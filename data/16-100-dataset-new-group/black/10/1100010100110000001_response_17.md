The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation levels and newline characters. The error message points to a comparison failure where the actual output does not match the expected output for the given input.

It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level when encountering a comment in the input prefix.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to rework the logic for tracking the current column and handling the indentation after encountering a comment in the input prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1  # Increment the column count for characters in the line after a comment
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version considers handling the indentation level after encountering a comment character in the prefix, ensuring that the column count is correctly updated. This should address the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
