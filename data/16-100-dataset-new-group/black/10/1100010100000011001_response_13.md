The buggy function has several issues, including incorrect handling of the 'wait_for_nl' flag, incorrect conditions for checking characters, and improper appending of lines.

The main cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the 'wait_for_nl' flag, which leads to incorrect line separation.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the function to properly handle the 'wait_for_nl' flag and character conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line+char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
