The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class seems to be causing an issue with the indentation of comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue. Upon analysis, it appears that the function is not handling the indentation correctly, which is causing the incorrect behavior when reformatting the code.

The potential error locations within the function include the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and new lines, as well as the condition for checking if the comment should be indented the same as the next line.

The cause of the bug is that the `wait_for_nl` variable is not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect handling of the comment indentation after a dedent. This is resulting in the incorrect reformatting of the code, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` condition needs to be revisited, and the handling of indentation for comments after a dedent should be adjusted to ensure the correct behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Fixed: set wait_for_nl to False here
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the corrected function should handle the comment indentation after a dedent correctly and pass the failing test 'test_comment_indentation' provided.
