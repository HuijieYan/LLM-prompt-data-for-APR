The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix string and return the consumed portion along with the remaining portion. However, it has a bug that causes it to not handle indentation and comment correctly, which is causing the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation when encountering a comment. This causes the function to consume the entire indentation before the comment, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual results in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to properly handle the indentation and comments, ensuring that it consumes the prefix string correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and comment in the prefix string, and the failing test should pass.
