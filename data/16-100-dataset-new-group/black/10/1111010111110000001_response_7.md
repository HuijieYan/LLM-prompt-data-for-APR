The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is not handling the indentation correctly, causing the failing test to produce an AssertionError. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the expected and actual output of the test.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the indentation level properly when processing the prefix string, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation level in the input prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    # unexpected empty line
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should handle the indentation properly and generate the expected output, passing the failing tests.
