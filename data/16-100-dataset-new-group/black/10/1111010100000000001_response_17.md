The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix within the Driver class has several potential error locations. The function is designed to partially consume the prefix and return the consumed part and the remaining part. However, there are issues with handling newlines and calculating the current column.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle newlines and their impact on the current column. Also, there is a logic flaw in updating the current line and column when encountering whitespace characters.

To fix the bug, we can revise the logic for handling newlines and whitespace characters, as well as correctly updating the current line and column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
This corrected version addresses the issues with handling newlines, whitespace characters, and updating the current line and column, ensuring that the function correctly partially consumes the prefix.
