The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a given prefix string and a specified column number, and then return the consumed prefix up to the specified column, along with the remaining unprocessed portion.

After analyzing the failing test and the runtime input/output variable values, it is evident that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and spacing characters, resulting in incorrect output. The function is failing to properly consume the prefix based on the specified column.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly tracking the indentation level and processing the characters within the prefix. The function incorrectly calculates the `current_column` for indentation and does not handle newline characters properly, leading to inconsistencies in the consumed prefix and the remaining unprocessed portion.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the indentation level, handle space and tab characters, and correctly identify and process newline characters to identify the end of lines.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming a tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now accurately consume the prefix based on the specified column, and the failing test should pass, satisfying all expected input/output values.
