The bug in the current function is that it does not properly handle the case where the comment is not aligned with the specified column. It fails to remove the extra spaces or tabs before the comment.

The function should track the column position and remove any extra spaces or tabs before the comment to ensure that it is properly aligned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, (prefix[len(res):]).lstrip()  # Remove any leading spaces or tabs
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue  # Skip rest of the loop
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add the current line to lines
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            continue  # Skip rest of the loop
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle the indentation and alignment of comments with respect to the specified column. After each line is added to `lines`, any leading spaces or tabs before the comment are removed before returning the result.
