## Analysis:

The issue reported on GitHub is related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation and processing characters line by line.

## Potential Error Locations:

1. `if wait_for_nl` condition might not be handled correctly.
2. Handling of tabs and spaces for `current_column`.

## Cause of the Bug:

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces when processing the input code with indentation and comments. The function fails to maintain the correct level of indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

1. Pay close attention to the handling of tabs and spaces for the `current_column`.
2. Ensure that comments are correctly indented based on the original indentation level.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += next_tab_stop
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I have modified the handling of tabs to ensure that the `current_column` is updated correctly. Additionally, I have added a condition to handle the newline character correctly and re-initialized `current_line` and `current_column` when a newline is encountered. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs as input.
