The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is that it incorrectly handles the indentation and parsing of the prefix string, resulting in incorrect splitting and incomplete consumption of the prefix.

One potential cause of the bug is the mishandling of tabs and spaces when calculating the current column position, leading to incorrect indentation detection. Another potential cause is the incorrect handling of newline characters, leading to an unexpected empty line when not properly handled.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that tabs and spaces are correctly counted when calculating the current column position, and that newline characters are appropriately handled to reset the column position.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now properly handle tabs and spaces, as well as newline characters to correctly split and consume the prefix string.
