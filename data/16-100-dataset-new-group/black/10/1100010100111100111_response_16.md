The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the indentation for tabulated comments to be incorrect after a dedent. This issue is related to how the function handles tabulated comments and indentation levels.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect handling of tabulated comments when encountering a dedent.
2. Inaccurate tracking of the current column position.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles tabulated comments after a dedent, leading to the incorrect indentation in the output. This is evident from the failing test case where the comments are not properly aligned after a dedent.

To fix this bug, the function should properly handle tabulated comments when encountering a dedent and accurately track the current column position to ensure correct indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle tabulated comments and accurately track the current column position, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
