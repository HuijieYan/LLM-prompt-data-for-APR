The buggy function is supposed to partially consume a prefix string up to a specified column. However, there appears to be an issue with how it handles line breaks and indentation.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Handling of indentation and line breaks
2. Logic for determining when to wait for a new line

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle line breaks and indentation correctly when waiting for a new line. This can result in incorrect consumption of the prefix string.

To fix the bug, we can adjust the logic for handling line breaks and indentation, as well as the conditions for waiting for a new line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_column < column:
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have adjusted the logic for handling line breaks and indentation. Additionally, we have modified the conditions for waiting for a new line based on the current column position. This should address the issue with consuming the prefix string up to the specified column.
