The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle cases where the current column is greater than the given column. This results in an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function checks if the current column is greater than or equal to the given column, and if so, returns the result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column >= column:  # Fixed condition
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_column >= column:  # Fixed condition
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the provided cases.
