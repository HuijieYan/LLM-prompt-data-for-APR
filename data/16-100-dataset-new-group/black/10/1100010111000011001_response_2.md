The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix`. It is designed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column number. It iterates over the characters in the prefix, updating several variables as it goes.

The potential error locations within the function are when updating `current_column` with tabs and spaces, determining when to wait for a new line, and appending lines to the `lines` list.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle multi-line comments correctly. It fails to properly consume character strings from tabs and spaces when encountering comments, resulting in a failure to accurately calculate the `current_column` and appending the lines in the wrong way.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle multi-line comments by accurately updating the `current_column` and properly appending lines. This may involve updating how tabs and spaces are handled, checking for multi-line comments, and updating the `wait_for_nl` flag.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False  # flag to indicate if multi-line comment is being processed
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif in_comment:  # check for multi-line comment
            if len(lines) == 0:  # start appending to lines
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            in_comment = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':  # start of comment
            in_comment = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
