The potential error locations within the buggy function are identified as the logic for handling the tab characters and the indentation after a dedent.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation does not correctly handle the indentation after a dedent with tab characters, which results in incorrect formatting of comments.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for handling tab characters and indentation after a dedent in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the indentation for comments is preserved correctly, especially when using tab characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version takes into account the correct handling of tab characters and indentation after a dedent, ensuring that the formatting of comments is maintained accurately.

With this corrected version, the failing test for the indentation of comments should pass, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
