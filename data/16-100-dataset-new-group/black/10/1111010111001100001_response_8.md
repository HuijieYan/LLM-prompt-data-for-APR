The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be occurring because it incorrectly identifies the indentation column for comments, leading to the failure of the test cases. 

The potential error locations within the function include:
1. Incorrect tracking of the current column for comment lines.
2. Unnecessary wait for newline when encountering a space or tab.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comment lines. It fails to account for the spaces or tabs before the comment when evaluating the indentation level for comments.

To fix the bug, the function logic needs to be altered to accurately track the indentation level for comments and handle newline characters, spaces, and tabs appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now accurately handle the indentation levels for comments and resolve the bug.
