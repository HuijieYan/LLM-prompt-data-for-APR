### Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix input string, removing leading whitespace, and updating the column number. The issue arises when the input string contains tabs, and the comment indentation changes incorrectly after a dedent.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The handling of spaces and tabs when updating the column number.
2. Conditions for checking and updating the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handles the indentation after a dedent. This results in incorrect comment indentation for tabulated inputs, as explained in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy to fix the bug is to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation for both spaces and tabs, ensuring that comments are correctly aligned after a dedent. This may involve updating the conditions for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':  # Update column count for tabulation
                current_column = (current_column + 4) // 4 * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version, the handling of tabs is modified to properly update the `current_column`. This ensures that tabulated inputs are correctly processed for dedent and comment indentation.
