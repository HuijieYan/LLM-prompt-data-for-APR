The potential error locations in the buggy function are within the logic for handling whitespace and newlines, specifically in the elif char == '\n' condition.

The cause of the bug is that the function _partially_consume_prefix is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. This is causing the failing test test_comment_indentation to produce the error message stating that the expected and actual output are not equal.

To fix the bug, the logic within the buggy function should be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
       
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                wait_for_nl = True
            
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent and pass the failing test. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
