The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is caused by incorrectly counting the column value and not correctly updating the current line and wait_for_nl variables in some cases, especially when encountering a newline character. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column value is reached, but it fails to do so in some cases due to the improper handling of whitespace and newline characters.

To fix the bug, the function should properly update the current_line and wait_for_nl variables when encountering whitespace and newline characters. Additionally, the column value should be accurately updated based on the type of whitespace encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if current_column < column:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            break
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

The corrected version properly tracks the current column value, updates the current line based on the column value, and handles the newline character to reset the column value. With these corrections, the function should now pass all the failing test cases.
