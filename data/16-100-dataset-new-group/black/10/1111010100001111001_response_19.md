The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error that causes it to incorrectly consume characters from the input `prefix` string. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix up to a specified `column` while preserving the remaining unprocessed prefix. However, it fails to handle certain cases of indentation and newlines, resulting in incorrect output.

The cause of the bug stems from the mishandling of whitespace characters and newline characters when updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags. In particular, the function does not properly handle cases where indentation ends and newlines occur.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to refactor the function to correctly handle and account for different types of whitespace (spaces and tabs) and newlines, properly updating the variables `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`, `lines`, and `current_line` as needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming 4 spaces per tab
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles different types of whitespace and newlines, updates the variables according to their intended behavior, and ensures that the function accurately returns the partially consumed prefix and the remaining unprocessed prefix based on the specified `column`.
