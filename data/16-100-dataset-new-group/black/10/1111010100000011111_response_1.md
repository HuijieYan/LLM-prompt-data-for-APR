To fix the bug in the given function, we need to update the logic to properly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. The issue described in the GitHub post indicates that when the input file uses tabs, the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent.

Based on the provided GitHub issue and the expected input/output values, it is clear that the buggy function is not handling tabulated comments correctly after a dedent. This causes the incorrect reformatting of the indentation for comments.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent. This may involve adjusting the logic for handling tab characters ('\t') and their impact on the current column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, the handling of tab characters ('\t') has been updated to adjust the current column properly. Additionally, the logic for processing the characters and handling the current line and column has been adjusted to ensure that tabulated comments after a dedent are handled correctly.

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent, addressing the issue described in the GitHub post and satisfying the expected input/output values for different test cases.
