The buggy function '_partially_consume_prefix' is a method of the 'Driver' class. This function is intended to consume a prefix string until a specific column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining part of the original prefix.

The potential error in this function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation level when consuming the prefix. This causes issues when handling tab characters and indentation levels.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect tracking of the current_column and the logic for handling whitespace characters, tab characters, and newlines.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the current indentation level and handle different types of whitespace characters properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function tracks the current indentation level accurately and handles different types of whitespace characters properly, ensuring that it consumes the prefix up to the specified column.

Testing with the provided failing test should now pass after applying this correction.
