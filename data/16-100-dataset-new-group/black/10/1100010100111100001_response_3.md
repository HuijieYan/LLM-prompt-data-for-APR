The function is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a specified column and current line. It iterates through each character of the prefix and accumulates characters to form a current line, keeping track of the current column. It then determines whether to consume the line based on the current column and a newline character or whitespace.

The bug occurs when the function incorrectly captures the prefix lines and does not correctly handle the indentation. This leads to incorrect comparisons in the failing tests, causing assertion errors.

To fix the bug, we need to track the current column and indentation level accurately while building the prefix lines. Additionally, we need to ensure we correctly handle the white spaces and tabs to calculate the indentation level.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic for handling indentation and newline characters. Specifically, we need to adjust the accumulation of characters into the current line and the evaluation of the current column and indentation level.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        
        if current_column >= column:
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the changes outlined above, the corrected function should now accurately capture and consume the prefix lines based on the specified column. This should address the bug and ensure that the failing tests pass.
