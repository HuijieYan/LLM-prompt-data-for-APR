The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing it to return incorrect results by not properly handling the indentation and the column position within the prefix string.

The bug is caused by the logic that is not correctly keeping track of the indentation and column position, leading to incorrect results being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the indentation and column position tracking within the prefix string. We should also check for the case when the prefix is shorter than the specified column and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
            if current_column == column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly keeps track of the indentation and column position within the prefix string and handles the cases when the prefix is shorter than the specified column.
