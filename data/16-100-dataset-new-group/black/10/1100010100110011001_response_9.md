The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indentation in the prefix text. The function is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column parameter, but it is not correctly handling the indentation and comments within the prefix.

The expected behavior is that the function should correctly split the prefix into consumed and unconsumed parts, based on the column parameter. However, in the failing test case, the function fails to handle comments and indentation properly, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle whitespace, including spaces, tabs, and newline characters. It should also properly identify when to wait for a new line. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the failing test case should pass, and the function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
