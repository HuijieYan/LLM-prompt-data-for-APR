The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix`, and it is designed to consume the input prefix and store it in the `lines` list up to the specified `column`. The issue seems to be with the indentation handling and the if conditions when encountering different characters.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` has a specific case that's failing, where the indentation of a comment in a string is not correctly processed and results in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output for `fs(contents_tab)`. The content is related to indentation and comments.

Given the analysis of the failing tests and the runtime values, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of spaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the logic for keeping track of the current column position.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling spaces, tabs, newlines, and indentation levels needs to be revised. Additionally, the handling of comments within the input prefix should be reviewed to ensure they are properly accounted for.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for a tab
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, there are a few modifications to handle the parsing of spaces and tabs. It is important to ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained.

This revised version should address the issue with the failing test and accurately consume the input prefix based on the given column.
