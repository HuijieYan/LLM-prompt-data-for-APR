To fix the bug, we need to change the current logic because it doesn't handle the indentation correctly, which causes the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = prefix.splitlines(True)
    consumed = []
    remaining = []
    current_column = 0

    # Iterate through each line in the prefix
    for line in lines:
        if line.strip():
            # Check the whitespace at the beginning of the line to adjust the indentation level
            leading_spaces = len(line) - len(line.lstrip())
            whitespace_size = leading_spaces - (current_column % 4)
            
            if whitespace_size > 0:
                # Append the relevant part to the consumed part
                consumed.append(line[:whitespace_size])
                remaining.append(line[whitespace_size:])
            else:
                remaining.append(line)
            
            current_column = 0
        else:
            remaining.append(line)
        
    # Return the consumed part and the remaining prefix
    return ''.join(consumed), ''.join(remaining)
```

This revised version should pass the failing test by correctly updating the consumed and remaining parts of the input prefix.

Please note that the code provided is only for the _partially_consume_prefix function, and it should be integrated back into the original class.
