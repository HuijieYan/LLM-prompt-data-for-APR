The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent. The function is not correctly handling the indentation when a comment follows a dedent. The bug is identified in the `wait_for_nl` condition block and the `if char == '\n':` block.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly reset the `current_line` and `current_column` after encountering a newline character. This results in incorrect handling of the indentation when a comment follows a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function should reset the `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character after dedent. Additionally, the function should handle the wait_for_nl condition correctly to ensure the proper handling of the indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset current_line and current_column after encountering a newline character
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character after a dedent, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
