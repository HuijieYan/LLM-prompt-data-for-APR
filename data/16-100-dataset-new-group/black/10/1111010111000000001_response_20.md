The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation and new lines. It appears to be incorrectly counting the current line and column, leading to incorrect handling of indentation and new line characters.

One potential cause of the bug could be the mishandling of indentation characters such as spaces and tabs. Another issue could be related to the logic for detecting new line characters and tracking the current column.

To fix the bug, we need to review and revise the logic for handling indentation and new lines in the `prefix` string.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        
        if current_column >= column:  # Check if the current column exceeds the specified column
            break
    
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(res):]
    return res, remaining_prefix
```

In this corrected version, I have adjusted the logic for handling new lines and column tracking. The function now correctly checks if the current column exceeds the specified column and breaks the loop if necessary. The remaining prefix is then correctly calculated and returned.

This corrected version should address the bug and allow the test function to pass successfully.
