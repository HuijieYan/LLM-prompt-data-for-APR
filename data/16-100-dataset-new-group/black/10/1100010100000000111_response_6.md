Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for tracking the current column does not seem to handle tab characters properly and may be causing the incorrect indentation.
2. The logic for checking and handling newline characters may also be incorrect. 

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of tab characters and newline characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. This results in incorrect indentation when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to correctly track the column.
2. Verify the logic for handling newline characters to ensure that it accurately resets the current column and handles unexpected empty lines.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Update the current column by adding 4
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version, the function now properly handles tab characters by incrementing the current column by 4. Additionally, the logic for handling newline characters has been modified to reset the current column when encountering a newline. This should resolve the issue related to incorrect indentation when using tabs in the input file.
