The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly consuming the input prefix string based on the given column value. The logic for updating the current column and waiting for a newline character is incorrect, which leads to incorrect outputs for the given input parameters. 

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for updating the current column and waiting for a newline character. We also need to handle the case where the prefix string is empty. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column += 1 if char != '\t' else 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = char
            current_column = 1 if char != '\t' else 4

    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ''
```
