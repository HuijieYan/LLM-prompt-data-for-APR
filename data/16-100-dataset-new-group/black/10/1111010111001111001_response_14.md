The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is failing because it does not correctly handle the indentation when an empty line is encountered. This causes inconsistencies in the output for the given input, resulting in the failing test cases.

The function is intended to consume a prefix string up to a given column value, splitting the prefix into two parts. It should handle indentation, spaces, and newlines according to the specified column value.

The bug occurs when the function encounters an empty line. In this case, it fails to properly reset the `current_column` value to 0, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the `current_column` is correctly reset to 0 when an empty line is encountered, and that the function handles all other indentation and character types properly according to the specified column value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0  # Reset column to 0 for empty line
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column to 0 for newline
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above corrected function, all the failing test cases should pass, and the function should produce the expected output for the given input values.
