The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior in the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs. 

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of tab characters and spaces when calculating the current column. The function adds 4 to the `current_column` for each tab character, but it should only add 1. Additionally, when processing a newline character, the `current_column` should be reset to 0, but it is not being handled correctly in the code.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle tab characters by adding 1 to the `current_column` for each tab encountered. When a newline character is encountered, the `current_column` should be reset to 0. Furthermore, the logic for handling and updating the `current_column` and the `wait_for_nl` flag needs to be adjusted to ensure correct processing of the input prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        else:
            current_column += 1  # add 1 for non-tab characters
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # reset current_column to 0 on newline
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that tab characters are correctly handled by adding 1 to the `current_column` for each tab encountered. It also resets the `current_column` to 0 when a newline character is encountered. Additionally, it adjusts the logic for updating `current_column` and the `wait_for_nl` flag to ensure correct processing of the input prefix.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.
