The issue with the current implementation is that it fails to correctly parse and separate the lines in the given input text. This leads to incorrect indentation behavior when comparing the expected and actual results.

To fix this issue, we need to make changes to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the different types of indentation (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) and account for comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the indentation and comments properly, resulting in correct behavior when comparing expected and actual results. This should address the failing test case for the comment indentation.
