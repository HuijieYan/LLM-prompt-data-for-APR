The issue with the _partially_consume_prefix function is that it is not properly handling the wait_for_nl condition, which is causing incorrect results. The function is supposed to partially consume the prefix and return the consumed part along with the remaining part. It checks for newlines and then updates the current line and column. However, it fails to handle the case where the indentation should end, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the elif current == '#' condition and also add a condition to reset wait_for_nl to False when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                lines.append(current_line)  # append the current line
                current_line = ""  # reset current line
                current_column = 0  # reset current column
            elif char == '#':
                # consume the rest of the line as a comment
                current_line += prefix[prefix.index('\n', prefix.index(char)):]  # consume the rest of the line
                lines.append(current_line)  # add current line to lines
                current_line = ""  # reset current line
                current_column = 0  # reset current column
                wait_for_nl = False  # reset wait_for_nl
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
