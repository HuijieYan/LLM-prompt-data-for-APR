The potential error in the _partially_consume_prefix function could be in the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a new line. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level and is not properly preserving the original formatting when a comment is encountered after a dedent.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not accurately tracking the current column and is not correctly handling the indentation level when encountering a comment.

One strategy for fixing the bug could be to re-evaluate the logic for handling indentation and comments within the _partially_consume_prefix function. The function should correctly track the column and handle the indentation level when encountering a comment after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should correctly handle the indentation and comments after a dedent, resolving the issue posted on GitHub and passing the failing test.
