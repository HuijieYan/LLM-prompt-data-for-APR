6. The bug is caused by incorrect handling of indentation in the function _partially_consume_prefix. It incorrectly manages the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, which is the issue reported in GitHub.

7. To fix the bug, the function _partially_consume_prefix needs to be modified to correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent and ensure that the indentation is maintained.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Change the indentation handling for tabs
            if current_column > column:  # Adjust the current column if it exceeds the specified column
                current_column = column
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
