The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be in the logic that handles the indentation. Specifically, the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being properly reset when a new line is encountered, and the logic for handling indentation with spaces and tabs is incorrect, causing incorrect tracking of the current column.

To fix this, we should reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` when a new line is encountered, and adjust the logic for handling indentation with spaces and tabs to correctly increment the `current_column` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming a tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column when a new line is encountered
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # Set wait_for_nl to True when a non-space/tab character is encountered

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle indentation and new lines, and the provided test cases should return the expected results.
