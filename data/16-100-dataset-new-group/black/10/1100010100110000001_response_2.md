The bug in the function _partially_consume_prefix is causing the failing test in the test_comment_indentation method of the BlackTestCase class.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments. When parsing the prefix, it is not properly taking into account the indentation level of the code and the position of the comments.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling comments and indentation levels needs to be adjusted to ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char in {' ', '\t'}:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the indentation and comments, and should pass the failing test.
