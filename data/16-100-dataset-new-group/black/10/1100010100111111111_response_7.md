The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is causing incorrect behavior when indenting comments after a dedent, particularly when the input file uses tabs. The function is incorrectly handling the indentation of comments, leading to failing test cases. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the function to properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

The issue reported on GitHub titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent" provides a clear description of the problem, highlighting that Black reformats the indentation of comments incorrectly after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.

To resolve the bug, we need to update the logic within the _partially_consume_prefix function to accurately handle the indentation for comments, ensuring that it aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the updated logic in the function, it should now accurately handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs. This correction will address the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
