The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation properly based on spaces and tabs. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` indicates that the function's output is not matching the expected output. It seems like the function is not preserving the indentation properly, causing the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying and handling the spaces and tabs at the beginning of each line in the given input prefix. This is leading to incorrect output when the test is comparing the expected and actual results.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation, spaces, and tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            elif current_column >= column:
                wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line:
        lines.append(current_line)
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the prefix indentation properly, addressing the bug and causing the failing test to pass.
