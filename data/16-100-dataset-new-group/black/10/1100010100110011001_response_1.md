The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the assertFormatEqual test to fail. There are several issues in the function that need to be addressed:

1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset to `False` after a newline character is encountered, leading to incorrect indentation.
2. The `current_line` variable is being reset before adding the lines when a newline character is encountered.
3. The function does not correctly handle the indentation of the comment line.

To fix the bug, the `wait_for_nl` flag should be reset to `False` after encountering a newline character. Additionally, the `current_line` variable should be appended to the `lines` list when a newline character is encountered, and the indentation of the comment line should be handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl flag
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    if current_line:
        lines.append(current_line)
        
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
