The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely causing incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function is not properly handling the indentation of comments, leading to the incorrect reformatting of the code.

The root cause of the bug seems to be the mishandling of tab characters and the conditional logic for detecting when to wait for a newline. This mishandling leads to incorrect tracking of the current column and results in incorrect formatting.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are properly accounted for in tracking the current column position and in determining when to wait for a newline. Additionally, we need to verify the logic for appending lines and handling the return value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Adjust current_column for tab character
            current_column = (current_column + 4) // 4 * 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, we have adjusted the handling of tab characters by appropriately updating the `current_column`. We have also fixed the logic for appending lines and handling the return value to ensure proper tracking of the prefix and correct formatting.

This corrected version should resolve the GitHub issue and pass the failing test case.
