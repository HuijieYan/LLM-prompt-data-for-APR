Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The logic for handling tab characters and calculating the column is incorrect.
2. The condition for checking if the column is less than the specified column is not implemented correctly.

The cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test, the GitHub Issue information:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used for handling the indentation and formatting of the input code. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` specifically checks for incorrect behavior in formatting comments after a dedent. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the indentation for comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent, especially when using tabs in the input file.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters and calculating the column to ensure correct indentation behavior.
2. Fix the condition for checking if the column is less than the specified column to accurately determine the indentation level.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Update to handle tab characters
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
