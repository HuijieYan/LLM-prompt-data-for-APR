The buggy function has multiple issues:

1. The `wait_for_nl` variable is not correctly toggled based on the condition and will result in the incorrect behavior.
2. The logic to check for the indentation level and substring does not handle all cases properly.

To fix these issues, we need to update the logic within the function to correctly handle the indentation levels and manage the `wait_for_nl` flag.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += ' '
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += '\t'
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should handle the given expected input/output variable values.
