## Potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The `wait_for_nl` flag may not be properly reset after encountering a new line character.
2. The calculation of `current_column` may not be correctly taking into account the tab character.
3. The logic for checking if a comment needs to be indented or not may be flawed.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is causing the comment indentation to be incorrectly changed after a dedent. This is due to the flawed logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, which is not handling tab characters properly and not resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag as expected. This results in incorrect indentation for the comments.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the tab characters, reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a new line, and adjust the logic for checking comment indentation.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Once the corrected version is implemented, it should be tested with the failing test case to ensure that the issue raised in the GitHub report is resolved.
