Potential error location:
The `current_column` variable may not be correctly updating the column position.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the `current_column` not correctly updating the column position. This causes the indentation to be incorrectly changed.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` variable correctly tracks the column position for tabs and spaces indentation.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # update the column position based on the number of spaces for a tab
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version, we have updated the `current_column` variable to correctly track the column position for tabs and spaces indentation. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
