The buggy function is failing to correctly handle the indentation of comments in the input code. It is not properly accounting for the column number when encountering a newline character.

The main issue is with the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables. The function fails to correctly identify and handle situations where the comment indentation is not aligned with the provided column number.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables should be adjusted to properly track the current column and handle newline characters. Additionally, the function should accurately determine the prefix and remaining suffix based on the indentations of the input code.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:
                # update current_line and wait_for_nl
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # current_line exceeds column, determine prefix and suffix
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, it should properly handle the indentation of comments and return the expected prefix and remaining suffix based on the specified column number.
