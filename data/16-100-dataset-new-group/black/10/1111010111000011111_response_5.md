This corrected version of the buggy function addresses the issue with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. It correctly handles the indentation of comments and the use of tabs, ensuring that the comments are formatted as expected.

The cause of the bug in the original function was that it did not properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs, leading to incorrect reformatting of the comments. The corrected function ensures that the indentation is correctly maintained for tabulated comments after a dedent.

By incorporating the specific logic to handle tabulated comments and their indentation after a dedent, the corrected function now passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output values. This resolves the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
