## Analysis:
The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix is intended to process a prefix string and consume it partially based on the specified column. However, there are several potential error locations within this function, including the handling of newlines, spaces, and tabs.

## Potential Errors:
1. The condition for checking if the current line is non-empty and the column is less than the specified column is incorrect.
2. The logic for handling newlines, spaces, and tabs may not be accurate.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the consumption of the prefix string based on the specified column. This results in incorrect processing of newlines, spaces, and tabs, leading to an incorrect output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Revise the logic for handling newlines, spaces, and tabs to accurately track the position within the prefix string.
2. Update the condition for checking if the current line is non-empty and the column is less than the specified column.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    # the corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
The corrected version of the function includes revised logic for handling newlines, spaces, and tabs, as well as an updated condition for checking the consumption of the prefix string based on the specified column.
