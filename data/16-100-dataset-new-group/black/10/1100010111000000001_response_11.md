The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation correctly. It is failing to consume the correct prefix, leading to incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying and consuming the indentation, leading to the incorrect prefix being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the indentation characters (tabs and spaces) and correctly consume the prefix based on the provided column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    is_indentation_finished = False

    for char in prefix:
        if is_indentation_finished:
            current_line += char
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                is_indentation_finished = True
                current_line += char

        if is_indentation_finished:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the given column. This should make the failing test `test_comment_indentation` pass.
