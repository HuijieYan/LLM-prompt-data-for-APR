The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior in the Black library when formatting code with tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is not properly handling the indentation for comments after a dedents, resulting in incorrect code formatting.

The potential error locations are in the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a newline character.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly tracking the current column and waiting for the next newline character to properly handle the indentation for comments.

To fix the bug, we can revise the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for the newline character. We need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the indentation level and handles the comments after dedents.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust current_column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes proper handling of the current column, adjustment for tabs, and waiting for the newline character. It should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report related to incorrect code formatting for tabulated comments after a dedent.
