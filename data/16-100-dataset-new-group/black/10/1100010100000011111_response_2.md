The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string by partially consuming it up to a certain column. However, the function is not handling the indentation and new line characters correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when processing tabulated comments after a dedent.

The main cause of the bug is the mishandling of indentation and new line characters within the prefix string. Specifically, the function does not properly reset the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when encountering a new line after indentation. As a result, the function fails to correctly handle multi-line tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix this bug, the function needs to accurately track the current column and reset the necessary variables when encountering new lines after indentation. Additionally, it needs to handle tab characters (\t) properly to maintain consistent indentation levels.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)  # Append the current line
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)  # Append the current line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)  # Append the current line
                current_line = char
                current_column = 1
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)  # Append the current line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                if len(lines) > 0 and lines[-1].strip() == "":
                    lines.pop(-1)
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    lines.append(current_line)  # Append the current line
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

In this corrected version, the function accurately resets the variables `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` when encountering new lines after indentation. It also correctly handles tab characters to maintain consistent indentation. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
