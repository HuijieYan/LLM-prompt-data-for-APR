The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function fails the test `test_comment_indentation` in the file `tests/test_black.py`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle tabulated comments after a dedent correctly. It fails to properly process the indentation and waiting for a new line after the dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent and ensure that the indentation is maintained as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column//4 + 1) * 4  # handling tabulation
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # handling non-empty line
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
