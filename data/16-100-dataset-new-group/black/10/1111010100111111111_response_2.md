## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the original function, there was a bug related to the handling of tabs as part of the indentation. The bug prevented the correct handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, particularly when the input file used tabs.

The bug was caused by the incorrect calculation of the indentation level when encountering tabs. The initial version of the function assumed that each tab character added 4 to the current column, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function adjusts the calculation of the current column when encountering a tab character. The corrected calculation allows for proper handling of indentation levels when using tabs.

Please replace the original buggy function with the corrected version provided above. The corrected function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
