The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function seems to be related to how it handles indentation and tab characters in the input prefix. This bug is causing incorrect output in the failing test, which results in the assertion error.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle tab characters when calculating the current_column. It treats each tab character as if it adds only one to the column, while in reality, it should add four.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling tab characters in the prefix. When encountering a tab character, the function should increment the current_column by four instead of just one.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle tab characters correctly and produce the expected output for the failing test. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
