The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is likely causing the indentation issue described in the GitHub issue. The function is designed to consume a prefix of text up to a specified column, while maintaining the lines and columns correctly. The bug is likely causing incorrect line and column tracking, which in turn leads to incorrect indentation in the output.

The bug appears to be related to the handling of indentation levels and newline characters within the prefix. In particular, the conditions for updating the current_line and current_column variables are not correctly handling tabs and spaces.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle tabs and spaces, and to update the line tracking when encountering newline characters. Additionally, the logic for when to consider a line as finished and update the current_line and current_column should be reviewed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming 4 spaces for a tab
            current_line += ' ' * 4  # replace tab with spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

        if current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles newline characters, tabs, and spaces properly, and updates the line and column tracking accordingly. It should resolve the indentation issue reported in the GitHub issue.
