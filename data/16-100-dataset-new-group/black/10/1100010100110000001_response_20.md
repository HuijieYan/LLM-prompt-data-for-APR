The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation of the comment correctly, which is causing the failing test. The error message indicates that the comment indentation is not being properly handled.

The bug is likely occurring because the function does not properly handle the indentation when encountering a comment.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation of the comment so that it aligns with the rest of the code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):  # check if it's a comment line
                        return res + current_line, prefix[len(res) + len(current_line):]
                    else:
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, the comment indentation will now be handled correctly, and the failing test should pass.
