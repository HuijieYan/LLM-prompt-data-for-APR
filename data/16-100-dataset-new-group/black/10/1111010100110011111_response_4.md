## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        indented_lines = [line[:column] + line.lstrip() for line in lines]
                        res = ''.join(indented_lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after dedent. The current implementation does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs. This results in the incorrect indentation of comments as reported in the GitHub issue.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the indentation and line breaks to ensure that comments are correctly indented after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

The corrected version of the function addresses the bug by modifying the logic to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. It uses the list comprehension to adjust the indentation of each line in the `indented_lines` list and then joins them to form the `res` result. This should fix the reported issue with incorrect comment indentation.
