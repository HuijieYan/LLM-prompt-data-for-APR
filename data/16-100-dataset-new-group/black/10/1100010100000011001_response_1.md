The buggy function has several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly according to the expected input/output values. The problems include:
1. Incorrect logic for handling indentation and newlines.
2. Incorrect variable initialization and assignment.
3. The lack of a successful return statement.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be corrected to handle indentation and newlines properly, initialize and assign variables correctly, and also add a successful return statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
