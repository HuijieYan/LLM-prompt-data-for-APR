The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the logic to handle tab indentation is incorrect, resulting in comments being incorrectly indented after a dedent. This bug is related to the GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The bug causes the comments to be indented incorrectly, especially when the input file uses tabs, as demonstrated in the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling tab indentation and comments after a dedent needs to be corrected.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8  # Use 8 instead of 4 for tab indentation
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the code now correctly handles tab indentation by increasing `current_column` by 8 for each tab character encountered. This updated logic ensures that comments are properly indented after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and address the issue reported on GitHub where tabulated comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent.
