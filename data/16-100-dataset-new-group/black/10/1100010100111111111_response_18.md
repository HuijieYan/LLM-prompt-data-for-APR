Based on the error message and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the function "_partially_consume_prefix" is not handling the indentations and comments correctly. As a result, it is not formatting the input properly, leading to a failed test.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation and comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect formatting. The logic for tracking the current line, column, and waiting for a new line is not properly handling the indentation and comments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation and comments after a dedent. Specifically, the logic for tracking the current line and column needs to account for the indentation levels and handle comments properly. Additionally, the function should properly handle the wait for a new line and adjust the formatting accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should handle the indentation and comments properly and pass the failing test. It will ensure that the formatting of the input is handled correctly, addressing the issue reported in GitHub.
