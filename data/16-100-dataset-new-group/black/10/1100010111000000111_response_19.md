The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent. This is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to fail, as observed in the GitHub issue "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    last_indent = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and (current_column < column or last_indent < column):
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                last_indent = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            last_indent += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            last_indent += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            last_indent = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
