The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect reformatting of the code, especially when the input file uses tabs.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the logic for handling the characters in the prefix string, specifically the conditions for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation and comments after a dedent needs to be reviewed and updated to ensure that the correct behavior is applied when consuming the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the in-code comments and their corresponding indentation are handled correctly, especially after a dedent. This change resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This should also fix the failing test case provided.
