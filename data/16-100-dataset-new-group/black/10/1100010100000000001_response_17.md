## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. It reads each character of the prefix string and checks for whitespace characters (' ', '\t', '\n') to keep track of the current line and column position.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The logic for updating the current line and column position might be incorrect.
2. The handling of the wait_for_nl flag and checking for the end of indentation seems inconsistent.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the function lies in the incorrect updating of the current line and column positions, as well as the inconsistent handling of the wait_for_nl flag. This leads to incorrect intermediate results and outputs when partially consuming the prefix string.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The strategy for fixing the bug involves:
1. Ensuring proper tracking of the current line and column positions.
2. Consistent handling of the wait_for_nl flag and the end of indentation.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the bug by properly updating the current line and column positions, as well as ensuring consistent handling of the wait_for_nl flag.
