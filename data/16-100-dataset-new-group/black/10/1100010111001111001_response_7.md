The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function lies in the condition for checking the current column value. When the function encounters a newline character, it resets the current_column value to 0, regardless of whether it is expected or not. This causes the wait_for_nl flag to be set to False, prematurely ending the indentation processing.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if the current column is less than the expected column value before resetting it to 0 when encountering a newline character. Additionally, we need to reset the wait_for_nl flag to False only when the current character is neither a space nor a tab.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:  # Check if the current column is less than the expected column
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
