## Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume part of a given prefix string and return the consumed portion and the remaining portion. By analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables right before the function's return, it can be observed that multiple cases are failing due to incorrect handling of the prefix string. In some cases, the consumed portion is not correctly identified, and in others, the remaining portion is not computed accurately.

## Bugs
1. The function does not correctly handle the condition to determine whether a line should be added to the `lines` list. This results in incorrect handling of the consumed and remaining portions of the prefix string.
2. In some cases, the `current_line` and `wait_for_nl` variables are not correctly updated, leading to incorrect values being returned from the function.

## Fix
To fix the function, the condition to add a line to the `lines` list should be re-evaluated, and the `current_line` and `wait_for_nl` variables should be managed more accurately.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the condition to add a line to the `lines` list and accurately managing the `current_line` and `wait_for_nl` variables, the corrected version of the function should now handle the prefix string correctly and pass the failing test.
