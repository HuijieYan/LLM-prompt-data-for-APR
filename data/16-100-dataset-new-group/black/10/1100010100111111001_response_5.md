## Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a given column, while keeping track of the lines and columns encountered. It essentially processes the input prefix character by character, updating the current line and column accordingly.

### Identified Issues
1. The condition for checking if the current column is less than the target column is incorrect, leading to incorrect line processing and output.
2. The handling of whitespace characters and line breaks is not aligning with the desired behavior of the function, resulting in incorrect line formation and output.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect update of the current column and line, as well as the incorrect logic for handling whitespace and line breaks. This leads to incorrect line tracking and output generation.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic for updating the current line, column, and line tracking needs to be revised. Additionally, the handling of different whitespace characters and line breaks needs to be corrected to ensure the function processes the prefix correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_column += 1
        
        if current_column >= column:
            break
    
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
