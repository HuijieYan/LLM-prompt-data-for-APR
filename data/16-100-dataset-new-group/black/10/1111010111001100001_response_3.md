To fix the bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function, we can make the following changes:

1. After concatenating each character to the current line, we need to check if the length of the current line exceeds the column. If it does, we add the current line to the lines list and reset the current line and current column.

2. We also need to handle the case where the prefix ends and there are still characters remaining in the current line. In this case, we should add the current line to the lines list.

3. After processing each character, we should reset the wait_for_nl variable to False.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        current_column += 1
        if current_column >= column:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        if char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
    lines.append(current_line)
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function should now pass the failing test.
