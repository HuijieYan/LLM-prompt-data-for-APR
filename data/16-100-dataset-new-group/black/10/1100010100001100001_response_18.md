The bug in the function seems to be related to the logic for handling the indentation of the prefix string. The function is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables, which are leading to incorrect behavior. 

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the logic for handling the indentation and line breaks in the prefix string. This can be achieved by properly updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables based on the characters encountered in the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should handle the indentation and line breaks in the prefix string correctly and address the issues identified in the runtime input/output variable values.
