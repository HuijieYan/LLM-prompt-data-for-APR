## Correction

The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. The conditional check for `current_column < column` is incorrect and does not accurately determine if the comment should be included in the result.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. This can be achieved by adjusting the conditional checks and updating the logic to correctly include the comments in the result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # adjust current_column for tabs
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the indentation of comments after a dedent correctly and should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
