The buggy function "_partially_consume_prefix" is supposed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column, and return the consumed string and the remaining prefix. It seems to have issues with correctly handling the newline character and updating the current column count.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Handling of the newline character and updating the current column count.
2. Handling of the indentation (space and tab characters) and updating the current column count.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that it does not reset the current column count properly when encountering a newline character, and it does not handle the indentation correctly, resulting in incorrect consumption of the prefix string.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to correctly handle the newline character and update the current column count when encountering it. Additionally, proper handling of the indentation (space and tab characters) is necessary to update the current column count accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                if current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_column += 1
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we properly handle the newline character to reset the current column count and correctly update the current column count for space and tab characters. This should fix the bug and ensure that the prefix string is consumed up to the specified column.
