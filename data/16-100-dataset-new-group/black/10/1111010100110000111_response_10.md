The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be causing an issue with the indentation of comments after a dedent. The error message indicates that the comment indentation is being changed incorrectly after a dedent.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the logic related to handling tab characters, spaces, and newlines.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly preserving the original indentation level of comments when there is a dedent. This results in incorrect formatting of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling tab characters and spaces needs to be adjusted to correctly preserve the original indentation level when a dedent occurs. It's important to ensure that comments are indented according to the surrounding code.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if char == '\n':
                    if not current_line.strip() or current_column >= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    else:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
