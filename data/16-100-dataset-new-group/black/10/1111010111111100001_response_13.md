Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles indentation and checks for newline characters. The function is responsible for consuming characters up to a specified column in a given prefix.

The bug is caused by incorrect tracking and handling of the current column and indentation. It leads to incorrect calculations within the loop, ultimately resulting in incorrect line splitting.

To fix the bug, the function should properly track and update the current column based on whitespace characters, account for different indentation widths, and correctly split the lines based on the specified column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = char
                current_column = 1 if char != '\n' else 0
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab as increasing the column by 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
        lines.append(current_line)
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

Using this corrected function should resolve the issues identified in the failing test cases.
