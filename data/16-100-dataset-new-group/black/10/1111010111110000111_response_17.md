### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line += char
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

### Explanation:
The provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` had a bug where it incorrectly handled the indentation of comments after dedent. This was causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to produce the error message due to incorrect indentation of comments.

The bug was identified in the logic of handling the indentation and newline characters. The code did not correctly update the `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character and did not handle the indentation based on spaces and tabs accurately.

The GitHub issue reported a similar problem related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This helped in understanding the root cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating `current_line` and `current_column` was corrected, and the handling of different types of indentation characters (spaces, tabs) was improved.

The corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation correctly and pass the failing test as well as resolve the GitHub issue related to the incorrect indentation of comments.

Please note that the corrected version of the function is provided based on the information available. It is important to thoroughly test the function to ensure its correctness in the intended use case.
