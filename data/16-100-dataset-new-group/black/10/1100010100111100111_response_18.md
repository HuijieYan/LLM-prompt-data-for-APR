The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior in the indentation of comments after a dedent. Based on the failing test and the runtime values, it seems that the function is incorrectly handling the indentation level of the comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly updating the `current_column` when encountering a new line or space character, leading to incorrect indentation calculation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is updated correctly for each character, and that the condition for checking the column before returning the result is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Changed the condition to <=
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, we ensure that the `current_column` is updated correctly for each character and the condition for checking the column before returning the result is accurate. This should fix the bug and ensure that the indentation of comments after a dedent is handled correctly.
