## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix string based on a given column value. The function then returns the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the indentation of comments and expects the correctly formatted output.

## Error Location
The bug is likely caused by incorrect tracking of the current column and indentation levels within the prefix string.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs when the function incorrectly handles the indentation levels for tabulated comments after a dedent. This causes the comments to be incorrectly reformatted, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to accurately track the current column and handle the indentation levels, especially when encountering tabulated comments after a dedent. This may involve modifying the logic for tracking indentation and updating the handling of tabs and spaces.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_column < column:
                        if current_line.strip():
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version of the function, the handling of tab characters ('\t') has been modified to accurately track the current column based on the indentation level. This should address the bug and ensure the correct formatting of comments, as reported in the GitHub issue.
