## The corrected version of the function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line = ""  # reset current_line for next line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The identified error is in the indentation handling and the return statement inside the `if` condition block. The error causes the function to iterate through the prefix string incorrectly, leading to errors in line spacing management and a fail to extract the remaining prefix.

To fix the error:
1. Modified the condition inside the `if wait_for_nl` block to only check if `current_column < column`.
2. Updated the else condition for handling the newline character to reset `current_line` and `current_column`.
3. Removed the `wait_for_nl` variable from the char conditional block and moved the assignment inside of the else block.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
