The main issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle the case where the prefix ends with a partially consumed line. This causes it to return incorrect results in cases where the prefix is not fully processed.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we handle the case where the prefix ends with a partially consumed line. We can do this by adding additional checks before the function returns, to correctly handle any remaining characters in the `prefix` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

This corrected version of the function will handle all cases where the prefix ends with a partially consumed line and return the correct results for all input scenarios.
