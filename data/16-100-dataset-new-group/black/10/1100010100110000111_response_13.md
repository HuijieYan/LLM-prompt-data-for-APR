## Analysis
The issue appears to be related to the `current_column` calculation within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It seems that the function is not correctly handling tab characters ('\t') and their corresponding indentation.

## Bug Cause
The `current_column` calculation is not correctly accounting for tab characters ('\t') which leads to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `current_column` calculation to correctly handle tab characters ('\t') and their corresponding indentation.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # adjust current_column based on tab size
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now correctly handles tab characters and adjusts the `current_column` accordingly. This should resolve the indentation issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
