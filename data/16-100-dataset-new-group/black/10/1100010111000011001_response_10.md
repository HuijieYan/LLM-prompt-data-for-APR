The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a few issues that cause it to fail the test. The main issue is in the logic for handling the indentation levels. It does not correctly track the current column when there are tabs or spaces in the input.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to re-implement the logic for tracking the current column and handling the different types of indentation characters (spaces, tabs, newlines).

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming each tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
