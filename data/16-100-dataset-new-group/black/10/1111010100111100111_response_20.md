The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. This causes incorrect reformatting of indentation.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the logic for determining the current column and lines based on the input prefix.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent. This is leading to incorrect reformatting of the indentation, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` flag and the computation of the current column and lines based on the input prefix needs to be revised to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif not wait_for_nl and char in [' ', '\t', '\n']:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
