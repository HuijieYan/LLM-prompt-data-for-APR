The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is failing to correctly handle indentation for the comment in the function `test_comment_indentation`. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling indents and newline characters, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify and handle different types of indentation characters and newline characters within the input prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Corrected the handling for tab character
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():  # Check for non-empty line before resetting
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle different types of indentation and newline characters correctly, leading to the passing of the failing test.
