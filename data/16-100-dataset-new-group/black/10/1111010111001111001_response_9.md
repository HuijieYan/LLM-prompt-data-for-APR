The cause of the bug is that the condition to check if the current line's indentation is less than the specified column is incorrect. This causes the function to return an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition inside the loop that handles the prefix to properly handle the indentation level and correctly consume the prefix. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.expandtabs().lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
