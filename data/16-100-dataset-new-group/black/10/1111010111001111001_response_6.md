The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function seems to be related to the handling of indentation and newline characters. The function is not correctly updating the line buffer and not handling the indentation count properly, which causes it to return incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling indentation and newlines within the prefix string. Specifically, we need to correctly update the current line, column count, and check for the wait_for_nl flag to properly determine in-progress lines and correctly separate them.

Additionally, we need to handle the case where the prefix string does not end with a newline or the column value is greater than the length of the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if wait_for_nl:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
                
                if current_column == column:
                    wait_for_nl = True

        if not prefix.endswith('\n'):
            lines.append(current_line)
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the indentation and newline characters correctly and produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
