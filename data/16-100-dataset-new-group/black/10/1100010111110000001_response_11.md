The `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be trying to handle indentation and newline characters in the `prefix` input. The error message from the failing test in `test_comment_indentation` suggests that the function is not correctly consuming the prefix.

One potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is the logic for `wait_for_nl` and checking the condition for returning the result.

The cause of the bug is likely that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters in the prefix, causing it to return an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be updated to correctly consume the prefix and handle the newline and indentation characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1  # Adjust the current column for other characters
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly consume the prefix and handle the newline and indentation characters, passing the failing test.
