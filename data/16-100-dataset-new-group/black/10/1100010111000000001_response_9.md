The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is expected to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached, and return the consumed prefix and the remaining unparsed prefix. However, the function is not correctly handling the situations where indentation or spaces are present, resulting in incorrect behavior when consuming the prefix.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for handling indentation, spaces, and newlines. Specifically, the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags seems to be causing the issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation and spaces within the prefix string, leading to incorrect consumption of the prefix and incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle spaces, tabs, and newlines, while keeping track of the current column position to ensure that the correct prefix is consumed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            wait_for_nl = False
        if not wait_for_nl:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n' or current_column + 1 > column:
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
                else:
                    current_line = ""
            else:
                current_column += 1 if char != '\t' else 4
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With the corrected function, it should now handle the indentation and spaces correctly and return the expected consumed prefix and the remaining unparsed prefix. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
