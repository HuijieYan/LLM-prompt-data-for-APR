To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. The issue seems to be related to how the function processes whitespace characters, tabs, and newlines.

Based on the failing test and the provided runtime input/output values, it seems that the function is not handling the indentation of comments correctly when there is a dedent. This results in the incorrect reformatting of the comments.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could include updating the logic for handling whitespace characters and tabs, and ensuring that the indentation of comments is preserved after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    # corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                if current_line.expandtabs().lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function updates the logic for handling whitespace characters and tabs, and ensures that the indentation of comments is preserved after a dedent. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the function pass the failing test.
