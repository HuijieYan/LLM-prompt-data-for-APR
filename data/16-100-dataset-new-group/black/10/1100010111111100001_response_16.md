The buggy function is _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column), which is designed to process a given prefix string, returning a tuple of two strings. The first string is a substring of the input prefix, and the second string is the remainder of the input prefix after the first non-whitespace character in a line starting at the specified column.

The primary cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the condition for `wait_for_nl` within the for loop. The code currently checks for a newline character before updating `wait_for_nl` and resetting `current_column`. This logic issue causes the function to return incorrect values for the prefix, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition check for `wait_for_nl` and properly handle the indentation logic. We should reset `current_column` only after finding the first non-whitespace character, and we should update `wait_for_nl` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif not char.isspace() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now process the prefix string correctly, leading to passing the failing tests.
