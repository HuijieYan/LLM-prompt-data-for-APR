Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent. It incorrectly assumes that the comment should have the same level of indentation as the next line, while it should be aligned with the code block it belongs to.

To fix the bug, we need to rework the logic of handling comments and their indentation. We should track the current level of indentation and use that to properly align the comments. Additionally, we need to handle different types of whitespace characters (tabs and spaces) properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_indent = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                # Determine the correct indentation for the comment
                comment_indent = "\t" * (current_indent // 4) + " " * (current_indent % 4)
                current_line += comment_indent
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_indent = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_indent += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_indent += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_indent = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly tracks the current indentation level and aligns the comments accordingly. It handles both tabs and spaces as indentation characters.

By using this corrected version of the function, the failing test case should pass, and the issue posted on GitHub regarding incorrect comment indentation after a dedent should be resolved.
