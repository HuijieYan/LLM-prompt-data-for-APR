The buggy code is incomplete and does not handle the logic to partially consume the prefix correctly, which results in incorrect indentation in the returned prefix.

The potential error locations in the code are:
1. The logic for `wait_for_nl` is inconsistent and does not fully capture the behavior of the function when encountering certain characters.
2. The conditional checks for `' '` and `'\t'` are not properly updating the `current_column`.
3. There is no handling of the trailing characters after consuming the prefix.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not accurately handle the indentation and partial consumption of the prefix. This results in incorrect formatting when the function is used in the failing test cases. The error message indicates that the indentation is incorrect, leading to the assertion failure.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be updated to correctly handle the indentation and partial consumption of the prefix.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column += 4  # assuming tab width of 4
                current_line += char
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
    
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    else:
        lines.append(current_line)
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, ''

```

After implementing these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and partial consumption of the prefix. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
