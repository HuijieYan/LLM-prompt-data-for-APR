The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of whitespace during the indentation process. The function is intended to consume the prefix and return the consumed lines along with the remaining prefix based on a given column value. However, it fails to handle tab characters and unexpected empty lines correctly. This results in incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the function should accurately count the number of spaces introduced by tab characters and handle empty lines appropriately. Additionally, it should track the total column value correctly to ensure the proper consumption of the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            space_count = 4 - (len(current_line) % 4)  # Calculate the number of spaces needed to reach the next multiple of 4
            current_line += " " * space_count
            current_column += space_count
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now handle tab characters correctly, maintain the correct column count, and handle empty lines as expected. This should address the indentation issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the failing test passes successfully.
