The buggy function has several issues that prevent it from working correctly. The main problems are with the `wait_for_nl` flag and handling of newlines and spaces.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to properly handle newlines, update the `wait_for_nl` condition, and ensure the correct tracking of lines, current_line, and current_column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char != '\n':  # ignore other characters
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
