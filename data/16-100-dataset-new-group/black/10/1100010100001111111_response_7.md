The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters and the `wait_for_nl` flag. When encountering a tab character, the function is not adjusting the `current_column` correctly, causing incorrect behavior when processing the prefix string.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the `current_column` based on the number of spaces represented by the tab.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate the number of spaces required to reach the next tab stop
            current_column += num_spaces
            current_line += ' ' * num_spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = bool(char.isspace())
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles tab characters correctly, adjusting the `current_column` based on the number of spaces represented by the tab. It also properly updates the `current_line` and the `wait_for_nl` flag based on the encountered characters.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
