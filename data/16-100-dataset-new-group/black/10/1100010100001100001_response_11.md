The bug in the provided function is related to the condition for returning the result. The function does not correctly consume the prefix characters to form the result string, resulting in incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the case when the current column is less than the specified column parameter. This causes the function to return an empty string as the result in certain cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for consuming the prefix characters and updating the result and current line properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version updates the result string and current line for each character of the prefix. It correctly handles the case when the current column is less than the specified column parameter, and ensures that the result is formed correctly.
