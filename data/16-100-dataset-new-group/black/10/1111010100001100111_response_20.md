The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the prefix of a string based on a given column value. The function is designed to iterate through the prefix string and accumulate characters into `current_line`, updating the `current_column` count based on different characters encountered and handling indentation. It then checks if the accumulated line should be returned based on the column value.

After analyzing the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it's evident that the function is not correctly handling the cases where there is tab indentation in the prefix string. The function's logic for counting column values and handling tab characters seems to be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not appropriately handle tab characters when counting the current column. This leads to incorrect identation handling, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the function to properly count the column based on tabs and spaces, and adjust the indentation handling accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
                current_column += spaces_to_add
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected version, we added a section to handle tab characters properly, updating the `current_column` count and appending the corresponding spaces to `current_line`. This ensures that the column count is accurately maintained regardless of tab characters. With this update, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and work as intended for cases with tab indentation, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
