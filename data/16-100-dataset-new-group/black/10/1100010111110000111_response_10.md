## Correction for the buggy function

The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it is not handling the indentation for comments correctly when dealing with tabs. This is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to produce a mismatch between the expected and actual output. The overall problem arises from handling tabs and spaces differently in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to change the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comments when using tabs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate current column accounting for tab width
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this fix, the function should now handle the indentation for comments correctly, resolving the issue posted in GitHub and passing the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
