The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix of text up to a specified column, and then return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. However, there are multiple issues with the function which causes it to produce incorrect results.

The bugs in the function include:
1. Incorrect handling of indentation with tabs and spaces. It incorrectly updates the `current_column` when encountering tabs and spaces.
2. Inconsistent handling of newlines. It doesn't properly reset the `current_column` when encountering a newline character.
3. Unclear logic for the `wait_for_nl` flag. It doesn't reset the flag after consuming the text up to the specified column.

To fix the issues, the function needs to accurately track the current column based on tab and space characters. It should also properly handle newlines and reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust for remaining spaces in the current tab stop
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version accurately tracks the current column based on tab and space characters, properly handles newlines, and resets the `wait_for_nl` flag when necessary. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the function.
