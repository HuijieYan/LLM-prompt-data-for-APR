## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by the incorrect handling of characters while iterating through the input `prefix`. Specifically, the logic for updating `current_line` and `current_column` is not consistent with the conditions for spaces, tabs, and new lines. This causes incorrect handling of indentation and leads to the failing test for indentation of comments.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `current_line` and `current_column` are updated correctly based on the character type encountered in the input prefix. Additionally, the logic for handling `wait_for_nl` needs to be adjusted to properly identify the end of the indent.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues by updating `current_line` and `current_column` based on the character type, and adjusting the logic for `wait_for_nl` to accurately identify the end of the indent.

By making these changes, the corrected function will appropriately handle the input prefix and correctly identify the end of the indent, resolving the issue with indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
