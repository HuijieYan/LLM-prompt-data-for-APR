To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to address the issue where the comments are not properly aligned after dedentations. The function should properly handle the indentation levels and preserve the correct formatting of comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level of the comments after a dedent. This leads to the incorrect formatting of the comments, as observed in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation levels and preserve the correct formatting of the comments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                if not wait_for_nl:  # handle the indentation of comments
                    current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                if not wait_for_nl:  # handle the indentation of comments
                    current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated version of the function includes changes to properly handle the indentation level of the comments after dedentations.

This corrected version of the function should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test cases.
