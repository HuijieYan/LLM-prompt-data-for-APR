The current function has multiple issues, including incorrect logic and missing updates for variables. Here's a breakdown of the bugs:

1. In the first conditional block starting with `if wait_for_nl`, the condition to check if `char` is a newline character is in the wrong place, causing it to be evaluated before updating `current_line`. This will cause issues when trying to consume the last line of the prefix.

2. The logic for handling tabs (`\t`) is incorrect. The current implementation adds 4 to `current_column` for each tab character, which is incorrect. Each tab character should increment `current_column` by enough spaces to reach the next multiple of 8.

To fix these issues, I would suggest the following strategy:
- Reorganize the conditional blocks to correctly handle character consumption and update variable values.
- Update the logic for handling tab characters to correctly update the `current_column` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column = ((current_column // 8) + 1) * 8
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
