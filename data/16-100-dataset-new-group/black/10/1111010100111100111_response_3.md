The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` which is a method of the `Driver` class. The function is designed to consume a prefix string until a specific column is reached, and then return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix string.

Upon analyzing the function and the error message, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments, resulting in incorrect output when compared to the expected output. This is also related to the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent".

The potential error locations within the function could lie in the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newline characters.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the indentation level when encountering a comment. This results in the comment being incorrectly aligned when the prefix is consumed.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and comments needs to be revised to ensure correct indentation alignment for comments. Specifically, the logic for tracking the current column and processing comments should be carefully reviewed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False

        if wait_for_nl:
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the indentation of comments and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
