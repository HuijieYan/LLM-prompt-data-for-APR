The bug seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming and processing the prefix string based on certain conditions, but it seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation logic.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly maintaining the indentation levels when processing the prefix string. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, a new logic needs to be implemented where the function should properly handle the indentation and tab characters to ensure that the comments are correctly indented after a dedent operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Update the column based on tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue and ensure that the comments are correctly indented after a dedent operation, as expected.
