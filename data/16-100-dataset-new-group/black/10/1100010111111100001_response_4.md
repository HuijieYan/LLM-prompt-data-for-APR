The cause of the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it incorrectly handles indentation and newline characters in the prefix string. This causes the function to return an incorrect result, leading to failed tests.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the logic for handling whitespace and newline characters in the prefix string. This can be achieved by iterating over each character in the prefix string and maintaining the current line, column, and waiting for a newline flag.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle whitespace and newline characters correctly, and it should pass the failing test cases.
