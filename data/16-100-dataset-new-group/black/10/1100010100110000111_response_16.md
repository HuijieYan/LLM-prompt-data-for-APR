## Fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the handling of comments during indentation. The provided code is not correctly handling comments and their indentation levels. This is causing the incorrect behavior when reformatting the code with tabs.

One potential issue is in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It does not handle the indentation level correctly when encountering comments, leading to incorrect formatting.

The error message from the failing test also indicates that the comment indentation is being changed incorrectly after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation level for comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming a tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # Adjust the indentation level for comments
            indent_spaces = column - current_column
            current_line = (' ' * indent_spaces) + current_line.lstrip()
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have added a condition to handle comments and adjust their indentation level based on the provided `column` value. This should resolve the incorrect comment indentation issue.

After applying this fix, the test that was failing should now pass, and the reported GitHub issue should be resolved.
