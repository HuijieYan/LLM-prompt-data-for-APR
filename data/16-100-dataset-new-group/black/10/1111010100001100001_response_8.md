The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle indentation levels. It fails to update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when encountering whitespace characters.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is updated based on the type of whitespace character encountered and that the `wait_for_nl` flag is set/reset accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab represents 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

I've added an additional check for indentation levels after encountering a newline character, and I've updated the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags accordingly based on the type of whitespace character encountered. This should fix the bug and handle different indentation scenarios correctly.
