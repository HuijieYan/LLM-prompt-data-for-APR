The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handling the indentation levels, resulting in incorrect output for strings with comments in different indentation levels.

The function fails to correctly update the `current_column` when encountering a newline character within the comments. This results in incorrect indentation levels being calculated when checking for column alignment.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is updated correctly when encountering a newline character within the comments. We should reset `current_column` to the beginning of a new line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current column to the beginning of a new line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now accurately handle the indentation levels and correctly output the expected strings with comments in different indentation levels.
