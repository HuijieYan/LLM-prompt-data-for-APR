Analysis:
- The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix is designed to process a prefix string and split it into lines based on a specified column width.
- The function tracks the current line, current column, and a flag for waiting for a new line.
- It processes each character in the prefix string and updates the current line and column accordingly.
- If a space, tab, or newline character is encountered, it adjusts the current column as per the corresponding indentation.
- The function is intended to return the consumed lines and the remaining prefix after consuming up to the specified column width.

Potential error locations:
- The logic for handling newlines and indentation seems to be incorrect.
- The condition for checking if the current line exceeds the specified column width may not be working as intended.
- The handling of newlines and column width adjustment needs to be reviewed.

Cause of the bug:
- The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of newlines and indentation, which leads to the function not properly consuming the prefix based on the specified column width.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for handling newlines and indentation.
2. Ensure that the current line is correctly updated and checked against the column width.
3. Verify that the function correctly consumes and returns the consumed lines and the remaining prefix.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
            if current_column > column:
                break
    res = ''.join(lines)
    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(res):]
    return res, remaining_prefix
```
