## A strategy for fixing the bug

The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the indentation when encountering a comment after a dedent. It is likely that the function is not correctly preserving the original indentation of the comments. To fix this, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used for indentation.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

The corrected version of the buggy function is provided below:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should correctly preserve the original indentation of comments, especially when tabs are used for indentation. It addresses the issue reported on GitHub and should pass the failing test cases.
