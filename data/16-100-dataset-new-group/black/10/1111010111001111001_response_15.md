There is an issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function which is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to fail. The function is failing to correctly handle indentation levels and comment positions within the input text.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly track the current column when encountering newlines and spaces. This results in incorrect splitting of the input text and the return value `res` cannot be obtained as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of spaces, tabs, and newlines in the input prefix and correctly track the current column during iteration.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                if wait_for_nl or current_column < column:
                    current_line += char
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    break
            elif char == '\t':
                if wait_for_nl or current_column < column:
                    current_line += char
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    break
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line += char
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    break

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should handle the input text correctly and pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`. The expected input/output values should also be satisfied.
