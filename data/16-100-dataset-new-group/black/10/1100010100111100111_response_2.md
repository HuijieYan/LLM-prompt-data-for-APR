The bug in the provided function is causing incorrect behavior when handling the indentation of comments after dedent. This is leading to failing tests and a reported issue on GitHub. 

The bug appears to be caused by the `wait_for_nl` flag not being reset after a new line character is encountered, resulting in incorrect behavior when handling the indentation of comments.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly reset after encountering a new line character.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the wait_for_nl flag
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the indentation of comments correctly and pass the failing tests, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
