The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it fails to correctly consume indentation, leading to incorrect output. There are several bugs in the function that need to be fixed.

The expected behavior is that the function should consume the correct amount of indentation characters (space and tab) when it encounters a comment in the prefix. It should then return the remaining prefix after consuming the indentation, and the consumed prefix.

To fix the bugs in the function, the following updates need to be made:
1. When encountering a space or tab, the current_column counter needs to be increased by 1 and 4 respectively.
2. When encountering a comment, the wait_for_nl variable needs to be set to True to indicate that the function should wait for a new line character to continue consuming indentation.
3. When encountering a new line, the function should reset the current_column counter to 0 if it's not expecting an empty line, and should also reset the wait_for_nl variable.
4. The function should return the consumed lines and the remaining prefix after consuming.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not wait_for_nl:
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these updates, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly consume the indentation and return the expected output for the failing test.
