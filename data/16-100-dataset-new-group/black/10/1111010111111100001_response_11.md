To fix the bug, the condition for checking whether to strip the current line should be updated within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Also, the lines should include the current line as well.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n' or current_column >= column:
                if current_line.strip():
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should pass the failing tests, as it fixes the condition that was incorrectly checking for the column value and handles the line correctly.
