The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` takes a prefix string and a column number as input, then iterates through the prefix while keeping track of the current line, current column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line (nl). The function expects to partially consume the prefix based on the column number and return the consumed prefix and the remaining unparsed prefix.

The bug in the function is that it incorrectly handles the current_line when waiting for a newline, resulting in inconsistent behavior when parsing the prefix. This leads to incorrect outputs for various input prefix and column values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current line handling is correct, especially when waiting for a new line character.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # Include the current line in the result
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function includes the current line in the result before continuing to parse the remaining prefix. This ensures that the function handles the prefix parsing correctly and consistently.
