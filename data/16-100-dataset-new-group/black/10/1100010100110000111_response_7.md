The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing an incorrect handling of indentation for comments. This is related to a GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent". The bug causes the indentation of comments to be changed incorrectly after a dedent in the presence of tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the indentation level and the wait for a new line. When encountering a tab or space, the function does not correctly update the current column, leading to incorrect indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly tracks the current column and properly handles the indentation when encountering tabs or spaces.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_column += 4  # Assuming 1 tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl flag
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, it should properly handle the indentation and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
