The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the incorrect reformatting of tabulated comments after a dedent. The test cases are failing because the function does not handle indentation correctly, leading to mismatched expected and actual output.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl`, as well as the logic for building the `res` variable.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect reformatting of the comments, as observed in the failing test cases. The function's logic for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` is causing the issue, leading to the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` needs to be revised. Additionally, the logic for building the `res` variable should be adjusted to ensure correct output.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    # Adjust current_line's indentation to match the specified column
                    current_line = " " * (column - 1) + current_line.lstrip()
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function handles the indentation correctly and should pass the failing test cases, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
