The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. However, based on the runtime values provided, it fails to correctly handle tabulated comments and results in incorrect indentation after a dedent.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it appears that the function is not effectively handling tabulated comments and their indentation levels. The `wait_for_nl` variable is not being properly triggered for tabulated comments, and the logic for managing the current column position is not accurately accounting for tab characters.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of tab characters and the failure to properly track and manage the current column position when encountering tabs. This results in incorrect processing of the prefix string, leading to incorrect indentation after a dedent.

To fix the bug, I would suggest introducing conditional logic to handle tab characters separately, updating the `current_column` value when encountering tabs, and adjusting the logic for managing the `wait_for_nl` variable to account for tabulated comments.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * tab_spaces
            current_column += tab_spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes conditional handling for tab characters and updates the `current_column` value accordingly. The logic for managing the `wait_for_nl` variable has also been adjusted to correctly handle tabulated comments. These changes should resolve the issue identified in the GitHub bug report.
