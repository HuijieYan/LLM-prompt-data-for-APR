It looks like the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the indentation when encountering '\t' characters, leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments. The function is not properly tracking the current column and is not handling the wait_for_nl flag correctly. This leads to incorrect indentation after a dedent, which is the issue reported in the GitHub post.

To fix this bug, I would suggest updating the logic for handling '\t' characters to correctly track the current column. Additionally, the wait_for_nl flag should be properly managed to ensure correct behavior when encountering newline characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                next_indentation = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_line += ' ' * next_indentation
                current_column += next_indentation
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should properly handle the indentation and newline characters, ensuring that the tabulated comments are correctly indented after a dedent.
