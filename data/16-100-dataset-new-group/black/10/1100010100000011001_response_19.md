The current implementation has several issues:
1. The `current_column` counter is not incremented properly for spaces and tabs.
2. The logic for handling newline characters and waiting for a new line is incorrect, which leads to incorrect placements of lines in the `lines` list.
3. The function does not handle the case where the input prefix is an empty string.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly increment `current_column` for spaces and tabs.
2. Adjust the logic for handling newline characters.
3. Ensure the function can handle an empty input prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Adjusted this line to include lines with column value equal to the given column
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values.
