## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if the comment should be appended to the lines list is not properly handled.
2. The condition for handling the indentation of the comment is not correctly implemented.

## Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments when the input file uses tabs. The function is not properly handling the condition for appending the comment to the lines list and handling the indentation of the comment after a dedent. This results in incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle the condition for appending the comment to the lines list based on the column.
2. Correctly handle the indentation of the comment after a dedent to ensure it is indented the same as the next line.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset the wait for newline flag and current_column
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if char != '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function includes handling the condition for when the comment should be appended to the lines list and correctly resetting the wait for newline flag and current column when encountering a newline character. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure the correct handling of indentation for comments after a dedent.
