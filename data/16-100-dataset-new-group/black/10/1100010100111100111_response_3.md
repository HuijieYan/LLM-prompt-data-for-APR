## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent. This results in incorrect formatting when the input file uses tabs instead of spaces, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function incorrectly handles the indentation level when encountering a comment after a dedent, leading to incorrect output and failing tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. This can be achieved by properly tracking the column and line information and adjusting the indentation as needed.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, resolving the issue reported in GitHub and passing the failing test.
