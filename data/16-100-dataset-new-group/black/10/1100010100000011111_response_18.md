The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the prefix string by updating the current line, current column, and other variables based on specific conditions. The function then returns the consumed lines and the remaining prefix. However, the function has several issues that fail to meet the expected input/output values and cause problems related to indentation and comments when using tabs.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrectly updating the `current_column` when encountering '\n'.
2. Incorrectly handling the `wait_for_nl` flag, leading to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the tab indentation correctly after dedent. It does not properly update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flag, leading to incorrect behavior when processing tabulated comments after a dedent. This is consistent with the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to update the logic for handling tab indentation and correctly tracking the current column. This will ensure that the function processes tabulated comments and indentation correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # reset current_column when encountering '\n'
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function properly tracks the tab indentation by using `len(current_line.expandtabs())` to calculate the length of the line including tab characters. Additionally, the `current_column` is reset when encountering a new line to handle the indentation correctly. These changes ensure that the function correctly handles the tabulated comments and indentation after a dedent.
