## The corrected version of the function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
1. In the original code, the condition for handling '\n' characters was inside the `wait_for_nl` block. This caused the code to incorrectly process the '\n' characters and resulted in incorrect indentation.
2. By moving the condition for handling '\n' characters outside of the `wait_for_nl` block, the function now correctly checks for the current column and processes the '\n' character accordingly.
3. This change ensures that the function correctly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
4. The function has been updated to handle '\n' characters and indentation levels accurately, ensuring that comments are correctly indented in the output.
5. With these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case and produce the expected output.
