## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Driver(object):

    # this is the corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding `wait_for_nl = False` after incrementing `current_column` for both spaces and tabs, we ensure that the function accurately tracks the indentation level and does not mistakenly wait for a new line when it encounters these characters. This resolves the issue with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
