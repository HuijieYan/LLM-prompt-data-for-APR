The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class has a logic issue where it fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments. The function is designed to partially consume the indentation prefix from the given input prefix based on the column width. However, it fails to handle the indentation for comments and returns incorrect results, causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation for comments and return the expected results for the given input prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        is_comment = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    is_comment = False
            elif char == ' ':
                if not is_comment:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                if not is_comment:
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                is_comment = False
            elif char == '#':
                is_comment = True

            if not is_comment:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now handle the indentation for comments correctly and return the expected results for the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
