The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is caused by an incorrect handling of the prefix and column parameters, which leads to an incorrect result in some cases. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the indentation changes, leading to mismatched results with the expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that checks for indentation changes and correctly update the `lines` and `current_line` variables. Additionally, we need to handle the `wait_for_nl` flag correctly to ensure that it captures the correct state of the input.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += '\n'
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these modifications, the function should correctly handle the input cases and produce the expected results, resolving the bug.
