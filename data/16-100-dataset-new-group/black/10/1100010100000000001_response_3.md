## Potential Error Locations
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being properly reset after processing a newline character.
2. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is not correctly handling the case where `current_column` is greater than `column`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the condition for checking the end of indentation. This causes the function to return incorrect results when processing the prefix string.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly reset and adjust the condition for checking the end of indentation to correctly handle the case where `current_column` is greater than `column`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Changed condition to include equal to
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_line = ""  # Reset current_line when encountering a newline character
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl flag when encountering a newline character
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```
