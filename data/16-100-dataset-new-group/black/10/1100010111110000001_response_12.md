The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic for handling the indentation of the code. It fails to properly handle the indentation of comments when there are spaces and tabs mixed. This causes the `assertFormatEqual` method to fail, resulting in an assertion error when running the `test_comment_indentation` test.

The current function is not correctly identifying whether a line of code is indented with spaces or tabs, which leads to incorrect processing and comparison of the code lines.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling line indentation and ensuring that the correct indentation is maintained for each line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ''
    spaces = 0
    tabs = 0
    
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            spaces += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            tabs += 1
        else:
            break
    
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if tabs > 0:
                raise ValueError('Inconsistent indentation (mixed spaces and tabs)')
            spaces += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if spaces > 0:
                raise ValueError('Inconsistent indentation (mixed spaces and tabs)')
            tabs += 1
        else:
            break
    
    indent = '\t' * tabs + ' ' * spaces
    
    for line in prefix.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith(indent):
            lines.append(line.replace(indent, '', 1))
    
    return '\n'.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

In the corrected version, the function first determines the type of indentation (spaces or tabs) used in the prefix. Then, it applies the indentation to each line of code and removes it to correctly extract and process the code lines.

With this corrected function in place, the `assertFormatEqual` method should execute successfully, and the `test_comment_indentation` should pass without assertion errors.
