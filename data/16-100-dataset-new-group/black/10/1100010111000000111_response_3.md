## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Change from 4 to 8 (assuming tab width is 8 spaces)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function was caused by incorrectly handling the tab character '\t', assuming it advances the column by 4 spaces, which does not align with the actual tab width. This resulted in incorrect behavior when handling indentation with tabs, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the corrected version adjusts the column count by 8 spaces for each tab character encountered, assuming a tab width of 8 spaces. This aligns the column count with the actual indentation, resolving the incorrect behavior reported in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle prefix consumption and indentation, passing the failing test and resolving the reported issue.
