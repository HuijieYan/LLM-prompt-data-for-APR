The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation of comments in the provided test case. The function is meant to consume the prefix of a string up to a certain column and then return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. However, it fails to handle the indentation of comments correctly, leading to the incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the indentation of comments when consuming the prefix. As a result, it fails to preserve the correct indentation of comments, leading to the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the indentation of comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, we need to make sure that the function correctly tracks and preserves the indentation of comments as it consumes the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust the column based on tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            if not wait_for_nl:  # Ignore extra newlines
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have added a logic to adjust the current_column based on tabs when encountering a '\t' character. This ensures that the indentation is properly handled, especially for the test case involving tabs.

With this corrected version, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments and pass the failing test case related to comment indentation.
