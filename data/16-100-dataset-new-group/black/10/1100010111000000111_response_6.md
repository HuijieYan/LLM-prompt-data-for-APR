The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation for the comments in the test case. The function is responsible for consuming the prefix of the input and determining the correct indentation level for the comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the indentation for the comments, especially after a dedent. This results in incorrect changes in the indentation level for tabulated comments after a dedent, which is the exact issue reported in the GitHub post.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. The function needs to accurately track the column number and check for tabulated comments to ensure the correct indentation level is maintained.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                indent_spaces = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip(' '))
                if indent_spaces < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the logic for tracking the column number and handling tabulated comments. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure the correct handling of comments after a dedent. With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
