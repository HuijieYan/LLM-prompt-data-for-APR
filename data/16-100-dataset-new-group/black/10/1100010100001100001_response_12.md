The bug in the provided function is due to the 'wait_for_nl' variable not being reset to False after it's set to True. This causes the function to incorrectly return the 'current_line' value as part of the result.

To fix the bug, we need to reset the 'wait_for_nl' variable to False after handling a newline character and append 'current_line' to the 'lines' list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
