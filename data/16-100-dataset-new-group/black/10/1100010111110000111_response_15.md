### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function appears to be responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent in the test case. The error message indicates that the formatting of comments is incorrect after a dedent, leading to the assertion failure in the test.

The GitHub issue also confirms this behavior, mentioning that the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent when using tabs.

### Bug Cause
The bug appears to be caused by the function not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are involved.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming 4 spaces for a tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The correction includes ensuring that the current column calculation accounts for both spaces and tabs correctly. Additionally, the condition for determining whether to return the result is adjusted to include cases where the current column matches the specified column.

With these modifications, the corrected function should handle the indentation of comments after a dedent properly, passing the failing test and resolving the issue.
