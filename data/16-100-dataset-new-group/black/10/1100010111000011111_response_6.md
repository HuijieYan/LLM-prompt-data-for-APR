The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic for updating current_column is not considering the possibility of a tab character, which should be counted as 4 spaces.
2. The logic for checking wait_for_nl and updating lines and current_line seems to be incorrect, resulting in inaccurate indentation tracking.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly tracking the current column and handling the indentation before comments. This results in incorrect formatting of tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle the indentation and track the current column when encountering spaces and tab characters. Additionally, the logic for handling wait_for_nl and updating lines and current_line should be revised to accurately track the indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the tracking of current_column and indentation, and it should pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug report related to tabulated comments after a dedent.
