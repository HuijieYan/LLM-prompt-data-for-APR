The cause of the bug is that the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the indentation levels and tracking the current line and column. This causes the function to return incorrect results, which leads to failing tests.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to review the logic of the function to properly handle the indentation, maintain the correct line and column positions, and keep track of the lines that have been consumed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    last_indentation = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            last_indentation = 0
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                last_indentation = current_column
        if current_column >= column and last_indentation <= column:
            break

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, current_line
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
