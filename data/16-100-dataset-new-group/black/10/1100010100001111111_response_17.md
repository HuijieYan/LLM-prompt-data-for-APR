The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a given prefix while keeping track of the indentation level. However, it fails to correctly handle tab characters and does not properly preserve the indentation level for comments.

The potential error locations within the function are in the handling of tab characters and the logic for preserving the correct indentation level.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly account for tab characters when calculating the current column, leading to incorrect indentation levels, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling tab characters to properly calculate the indentation level. We should also ensure that the correct indentation level is preserved for comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * tab_spaces
            current_column += tab_spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles tab characters and preserves the correct indentation level for comments, as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
