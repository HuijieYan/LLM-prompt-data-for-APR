The issue with the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it is not correctly handling the indentation level of comments in the code. This is causing indented comments to be removed incorrectly, leading to failing test cases when comparing the expected and actual outputs.

The problem can primarily be attributed to the conditions in the function that check for spaces, tabs, and newlines within the `prefix` string. These conditions are not correctly accounting for indentation levels and comments.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation level and positioning of comments within the `prefix` string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        in_multiline_comment = False
        for char in prefix:
            if in_multiline_comment:
                if char == '\n':
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    in_multiline_comment = False
                continue
            
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '#':
                in_multiline_comment = True
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This version includes additional logic to correctly handle multi-line comments and indentation levels, ensuring that comments are processed and preserved as expected within the `prefix` string.
