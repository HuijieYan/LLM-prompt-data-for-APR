To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to address the incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent. The issue is due to the `wait_for_nl` flag not being reset to `False` when a new line is encountered, causing the comment indentation to be incorrect.

We can fix the bug by adding an `else` block to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` when encountering a new line. This will ensure that the comment indentation is handled correctly after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this fix, the `wait_for_nl` flag is correctly reset to `False` when encountering a new line, ensuring that the comment indentation is handled properly. This should address the indentation issue reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test cases.
