The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling indentation and comments in the input prefix string. This is causing the incorrect behavior when comparing the two input strings `contents_tab` and `contents_spc` in the failing test.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Improper handling of spaces and tabs leading to incorrect column calculations.
2. Incorrect check for line breaks and comments.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly determining the indentation levels and failing to preserve the comments when consuming the prefix string, resulting in incorrect processing of the input.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling spaces and tabs to properly calculate the `current_column`.
2. Correctly handle line breaks and comments to ensure they are preserved during prefix consumption.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0  # Reset current column for new line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_column += 1  # Increment column for regular character
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of `_partially_consume_prefix` should now pass the failing test.
