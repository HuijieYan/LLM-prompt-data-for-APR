The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it incorrectly checks for the column after consuming a new line character. This causes the line to be processed before it is checked against the required column value. As a result, the function returns the wrong substring.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to rearrange the logic to properly handle the column check and line processing. Additionally, the condition for checking and appending the current line to the list of lines is incorrect. It should be based on whether the line is empty or if the current column exceeds the specified column value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function rearranges the logic to properly handle the column check and line processing. It also fixes the condition for checking and appending the current line to the list of lines.

After making these changes, the `test_comment_indentation` should pass without the assertion error.
