The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. However, there are several potential error locations within the function, such as:
1. The logic for updating `current_column` when encountering whitespace characters (space and tab) is incorrect, which can lead to incorrect counting of the column position.
2. The condition for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` is not properly placed, which may cause the function to miss updating the column position or entering the expected state.

The potential cause of the bug in the function is the incorrect handling of whitespace characters and newline characters. In particular, the logic for updating the `current_column` and determining when to wait for a newline character is flawed.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly update the `current_column` based on space and tab characters, and properly handle the logic for waiting for a newline character. Additionally, the function should accurately track the lines and columns up to the specified limit.

A corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_column += 1
                    if current_column == column:
                        wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the `current_column` is less than the specified column limit before appending the character to the `current_line`. The logic for updating `current_column` and determining when to wait for a newline character is properly handled within the loop. Finally, the result is formed by joining the lines and the remaining prefix string after consumption.
