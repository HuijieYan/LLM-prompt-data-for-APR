The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the indentation of comments is changing incorrectly after a dedent, particularly when the input file uses tabs. This aligns with the behavior observed in the buggy function where the indentation is not correctly handled.

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has several potential error locations, including the incorrect handling of indentation levels, the check for a newline character, and the management of the `wait_for_nl` flag.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of indentation levels and the `wait_for_nl` flag. When the function encounters tabs or spaces, it does not handle the indentation level properly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks and handles the indentation level as well as the presence of a new line. Additionally, the `wait_for_nl` flag needs to be managed properly to handle indentation changes effectively.

Based on the analysis of the issue and the buggy function, a strategy for fixing the bug includes:
1. Ensure that the function correctly updates the `current_column` when encountering spaces or tabs.
2. Properly manage the `wait_for_nl` flag to handle the end of indentation and the presence of a new line.
3. Update the logic to correctly handle the indentation level and preserve it during the processing of the prefix string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                if current_line.strip():
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_line.strip():
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues in handling indentation levels, the `wait_for_nl` flag, and the processing of the prefix string. It should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
