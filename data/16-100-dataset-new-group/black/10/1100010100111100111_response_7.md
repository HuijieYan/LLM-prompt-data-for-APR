The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect behavior in the indentation of comments in the presence of tabs. The function is not correctly handling the indentation and waiting for a new line after dedent. This is resulting in the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags when encountering tabs and newlines, which is leading to incorrect handling of the indentation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation levels and waiting for a new line after dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and waiting for a new line after a dedent, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.

The corrected function should pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior, addressing the reported indentation issue.
