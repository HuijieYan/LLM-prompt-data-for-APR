The bug in the provided function lies in the logic for determining the position of the column in the input prefix and the identification of lines within the prefix. The function fails to correctly determine the lines and handle the indentations.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves accurately tracking the lines and handling the indentation within the prefix while considering the column position. This can be done by adjusting the logic for handling space, tab, and newline characters, as well as maintaining the correct values for `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` according to the input prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version addresses the issues with determining lines and handling the indentations within the prefix by adjusting the logic for space, tab, and newline characters, as well as maintaining the correct values for `current_column` and `wait_for_nl`.
