The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function appears to be related to how it processes the input `prefix` in combination with the `column` parameter. It seems to not be handling the indentation and comment lines properly.

The function is expected to return a tuple containing two strings â€“ the first being consumed parts of the prefix that represent lines, and the second being the remaining unprocessed part of the prefix.

Based on the failing error message and the provided runtime input/output values, it is clear that the function is not properly handling the indentation and comments within the `prefix`.

A key issue seems to be that when encountering a newline character, the function is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `lines` variables. This leads to incorrect handling of the indentation and comment lines, causing the function to return unexpected results.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the indentation, newlines, and comment lines in the `prefix`. The logic for updating `current_column` and `lines` when encountering newline characters needs to be adjusted to correctly handle indentation and comments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_column += 1

        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the indentation and comment lines, addressing the issues observed in the failing tests.
