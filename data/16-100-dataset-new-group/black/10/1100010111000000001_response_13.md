The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the `test_comment_indentation` test to fail.

The potential error in the function seems to be related to the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables. It appears that the function is not correctly handling tab characters and not properly identifying the end of the indentation.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling tab characters ('\t') and is not correctly detecting the end of the indentation. This results in incorrect behavior when determining the indentation level.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the logic for handling tab characters and the detection of the end of the indentation to ensure that the function accurately tracks the current column and waits for the end of the indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # consider tab as 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should now accurately handle tab characters and correctly identify the end of the indentation, addressing the bug and causing the failing test to pass.
