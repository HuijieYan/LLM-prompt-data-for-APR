The bug in the given function is that it does not handle the case where a newline character appears in the prefix. When a newline character is encountered, the function should reset the `current_column` to 0, which it doesn't do.

The function should be modified to handle the case when a newline character is encountered by resetting the `current_column` to 0.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset the current column to 0
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should be able to handle cases with newline characters and correctly calculate the `current_column`. This should resolve the failing test.
