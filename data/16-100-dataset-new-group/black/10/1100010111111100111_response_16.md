The problem in the buggy function is that it incorrectly handles the indentation levels for comments when using tabs. This causes the failing test to produce an AssertionError, as the expected and actual output do not match. The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem and specifies that the issue occurs when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation levels for comments when using tabs as specified in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                current_column = len(current_line.expandtabs())
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function will handle the indentation levels correctly for comments when using tabs, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
