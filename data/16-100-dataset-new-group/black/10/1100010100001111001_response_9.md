The bug in the provided function is caused by incorrect handling of the indentation levels and new lines. The function is meant to consume part of a prefix string until a certain column is reached, but it fails to handle new lines and indentation characters accurately, resulting in incorrect output.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables based on different characters encountered in the prefix string, such as spaces, tabs, and new lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                if current_column < column and current_line.strip():
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all the provided test cases.
