The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is caused by the conditional logic inside the for loop. The function is not handling whitespace correctly and is prematurely returning a value, resulting in incomplete string processing.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the for loop to properly handle whitespace characters, keep track of the current column, and correctly determine when to return the result.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_column < column:
                while current_column < column:
                    current_line += ' '
                    current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version uses a more accurate approach to handling whitespace characters and tracking the current column. It ensures that the function keeps processing the prefix until the correct column is reached before returning the result.
