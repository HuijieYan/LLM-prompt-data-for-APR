The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error that causes it to return incorrect values. The 'wait_for_nl' condition is not properly handled, which leads to incorrect indentation tracking. This can be fixed by updating the logic for tracking line breaks and indentation in the function.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for tracking line breaks and indentation, and handle 'wait_for_nl' condition properly. Specifically, we should ensure that the 'current_line' and 'current_column' variables are updated correctly for each character processed, and that the 'lines' list is appended properly when a new line is encountered.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrections to the function, it should now handle indentation and line breaks properly, satisfying the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
