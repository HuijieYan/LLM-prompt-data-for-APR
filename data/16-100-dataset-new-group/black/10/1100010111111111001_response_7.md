The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation. It fails to correctly consume the prefix and return the residual string, which causes the failing test `test_comment_indentation`. The function incorrectly handles the indentation, skipping over spaces and tabs when it should count them to determine the correct column.

To fix the bug, a strategy to accurately handle the indentation and correctly consume the prefix would involve correctly counting the spaces and tabs to determine the current column. This can be achieved by modifying the logic for counting the spaces and tabs in the prefix and properly updating the `current_column` variable.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                 wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
