Based on the failing test and the error message, the problem seems to be that the function is trying to subtract a float from an array of integers, causing a `UFuncTypeError` during the execution of the `-=` operation due to the mixed data types.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the data type of the input array `x` is `float32` before performing any operations that involve floating-point numbers. We also need to make sure that the return value of the function is consistent with the expected behavior of the preprocessing steps.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Ensure x is of type float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
            
    return x
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that `x` is cast to float32 at the beginning of the function, and we also ensure that all the mean and std values are of type float32 when used for operations with `x`.

These changes should ensure that the function operates consistently with different data types and that the UFuncTypeError is avoided.
