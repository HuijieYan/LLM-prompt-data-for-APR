The potential error in the function is with the computation of the mean and standard deviation for the 'torch' mode and the 'else' mode.
The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the 'torch' mode for preprocessing the input array. It also has incorrect handling for the 'else' case in terms of computing the mean and standard deviation for different data formats.
One strategy for fixing the bug is to properly compute the mean and standard deviation for the 'torch' mode and the 'else' mode, taking into account the data format, and then apply the zero-centering and normalization operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel and normalize
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

In the corrected version, the mean and standard deviation are computed according to the data format and mode, and the zero-centering and normalization operations are performed in a consistent manner.
