The issue in the buggy function arises from the fact that when the 'mode' is 'torch', the mean and std variables are defined, but the code then continues to execute the code outside of the 'else' block, which should only be executed when 'mode' is not 'tf' or 'torch'. This leads to an attempt to manipulate the array 'x' in a way that conflicts with the pre-defined 'mean' and 'std' arrays when 'mode' is 'torch', resulting in a type error due to inconsistent data types.

To fix the bug, the code inside the 'else' block should be executed when 'mode' is not 'tf' or 'torch'. Additionally, the logic for 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' should be properly handled for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.
    
    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
    
    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
    
    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
    
    return x
```

With the above corrected function, it should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
