The issue with the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is that when the `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch', and the `data_format` is not 'channels_first', the function is not correctly handling the input.

The problem is that the function attempts to perform array arithmetic and assignment operations without explicitly typecasting the input array `x`. The error message `UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'` indicates that the input array `x` has a dtype of 'int32', and is being used with floating point arithmetic and assignments. This is causing a type mismatch and resulting in the error.

To fix this, we can explicitly cast the input array `x` to a floating point dtype at the beginning of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

```

By explicitly casting `x` to a float32 dtype at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all subsequent arithmetic and assignment operations are performed with floating point calculations. This should resolve the type mismatch issue and allow the function to handle the input correctly.
