The bug in the given function is that it does not properly handle the case when the mode is set to "torch". This leads to incorrect preprocessing of the input array 'x'.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to properly implement the preprocessing steps for the "torch" mode when the function is called with this mode.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

        # Zero-center and normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

        return x

    # Handle modes other than 'tf' and 'torch'
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[::-1, ...]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
    else:
        x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'

        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

    return x
```

In the corrected function, I added logic to properly handle the "torch" mode, which was previously missing. The array 'x' is now properly zero-centered and normalized for the "torch" mode, as per the ImageNet dataset.
