The `preprocess_input` function is intended to preprocess a numpy array encoding a batch of images, according to the specified data format and mode. The error message indicates a problem with the data type casting when subtracting the mean values. The error occurs when the data format is 'channels_last' and the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

The cause of the bug is that when the data format is 'channels_last' and the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function attempts to subtract the mean values directly from the input array `x`, which leads to a data type mismatch error.

To fix the bug, in the case when the data format is 'channels_last' and the mode is neither 'tf' nor 'torch', the mean values should be broadcasted to match the shape of the input array `x`, and then subtracted from `x`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x -= mean  # Subtract the mean directly
        x /= std   # Divide by std
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    std = None

    # Broadcast mean and subtract
    x -= np.array(mean)
    if std is not None:
        x /= np.array(std)
    return x
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the error related to the data type mismatch will be resolved.
