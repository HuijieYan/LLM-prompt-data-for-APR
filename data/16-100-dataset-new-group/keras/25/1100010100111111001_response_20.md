The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that the code does not correctly handle the case when the `mode` is set to `'torch'`. The implementation only computes the `mean` and `std` values for this mode, but it does not use them to preprocess the input array `x`. Instead, it follows the default preprocessing logic and operates on `x` with the `orange` variable, resulting in a UFuncTypeError when trying to subtract a float64 from an int32 value.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `mean` and `std` values when the `mode` is set to `'torch'`. We can then update the input array `x` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
