The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function can be identified by the error message and the input/output variable values. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError`, which suggests an issue with a numeric operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.) between two arrays or an array and a scalar.

Analyzing the runtime input/output values and types of variables, it is observed that the function is operating with floating-point values, but the original input `x` is of type `int32`. This inconsistency is causing the error when the function tries to perform operations (division, subtraction) on the input.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input `x` is converted to a floating-point array before any mathematical operations are performed, to prevent type inconsistencies.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float32 to ensure consistent type
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```

By explicitly converting the input `x` to a floating-point array using `x.astype('float32')`, we ensure that all subsequent operations will use consistent numeric types, thus resolving the UFuncTypeError.
