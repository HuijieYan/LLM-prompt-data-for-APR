The issue in the buggy code is with the data type mismatch when doing arithmetic operations in the `else` block for `mode` other than 'tf' or 'torch'. The error message indicates that there is a `UFuncTypeError` due to the inability to cast the output of a subtraction operation from floating point to integer data type.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the data types are consistent throughout the calculations and operations, especially when the input `x` is of integer type. We can do this by explicitly casting or converting `mean` and `std` to the same data type as `x` before performing the operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.  # perform the operations in one step
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)  # make sure to use the same dtype as x
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)  # make sure to use the same dtype as x
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)  # make sure to use the same dtype as x
            std = None

    if mean is not None:  # Check if mean is set
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x -= mean[:, None, None]  # Subtract mean for each color channel
            if std is not None:
                x /= std[:, None, None]  # Normalize by std for each color channel
        else:
            x -= mean
            if std is not None:
                x /= std
    
    return x
```

In this corrected version:
1. We perform the operations in one step for the 'tf' mode to avoid any data type conflicts.
2. When calculating the `mean` and `std` for the 'torch' mode, we explicitly cast them to the same data type as `x` to ensure consistency.
3. We also ensure that the subtraction and division operations are consistent with the data type of `x` in the other branches of the function.
