The bug occurs because the function is directly manipulating the input array `x` without considering its input type and making sure it is converted to the appropriate type before manipulation. In the failing test cases, the input array `x` is of type `int32`, but the function is performing calculations that require floating point values without ensuring `x` is converted to a float type. This results in an error when trying to subtract a float value from an int32 value.

To fix the bug, the function should check the input type of `x` and cast it to a float type if it is not already in that format before performing any calculations.

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
