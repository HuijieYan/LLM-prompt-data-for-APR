In the given error message, the failing test is trying to assert that `utils.preprocess_input(xint).shape == xint.shape`. However, the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is throwing an error at line 82 where it is trying to do the subtraction `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`. The error is a `UFuncTypeError` and the message states that it cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'. This suggests that there is an issue with data types being incompatible for subtraction.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the data types are compatible when performing operations like subtraction. Based on the error message, it seems that the data type of `x` is float64, while the mean array is attempting to perform subtraction as an int32. To solve this, the mean array should be the same data type as input `x` before performing the subtraction operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

By updating the mean and std arrays to have the same data type as input array `x`, the correction ensures that the operations involving subtraction are done with compatible data types. This should resolve the UFuncTypeError and allow the function to work correctly with the given test cases.
