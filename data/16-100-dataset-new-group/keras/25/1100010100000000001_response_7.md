Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- Incorrect calculations for mean and standard deviation for 'tf' and 'torch' modes.
- Incorrect dimension handling for the input array 'x'.

Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises from incorrect calculations and dimension handling within the function. The function is not correctly preprocessing the input Numpy array based on the specified mode and data format, leading to incorrect results when using the function.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the calculations for mean and standard deviation based on the specified mode.
2. Ensure correct dimension handling for the input array based on the data format.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
