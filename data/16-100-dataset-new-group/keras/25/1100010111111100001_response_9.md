The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is due to the incorrect data type of the input array `x` after the operation, particularly when `mode` is set to 'caffe' or 'torch'. The function returns a float array, but when the input `x` is of type `int32`, this leads to a mismatch and causes the test to fail with a UFuncTypeError.

The current implementation of the function is not handling the `mode` correctly, especially when dealing with integer arrays and converting them to float arrays. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a float array when necessary, based on the `mode` and its scale factors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if mode in ['caffe', 'torch']:
        # Zero-center by mean pixel
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly convert the input array `x` to `float32` when necessary before performing any operations related to the `mode` such as division and subtraction. This should ensure that the array `x` always has the appropriate data type and handle the scaling required for different modes.
