The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by an inconsistency in the preprocessing calculations when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'. When the `mode` is 'caffe' and the `data_format` is either 'channels_first' or 'channels_last', the function fails to correctly apply the preprocessing steps, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the preprocessing steps are correctly applied based on the `mode` and `data_format` values.

Here is a corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = np.flip(x, axis=0)
            else:
                x = np.flip(x, axis=1)
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = np.flip(x, axis=-1)
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
    return x
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly preprocess the input arrays based on the provided mode and data format, satisfying the expected input/output values for all the provided cases.
