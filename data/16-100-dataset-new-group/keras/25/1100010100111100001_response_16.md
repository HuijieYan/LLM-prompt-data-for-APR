The issue in the buggy function is that when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', the calculation to preprocess the input `x` is not properly handled and leads to a UFuncTypeError, because the input `x` could be an integer array and the calculation tries to subtract or divide by a float value from the list `mean` and `std`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input `x` is converted to a float array before processing. This can be done using the `astype` function to convert `x` to a float array before the preprocessing operations are performed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float array
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
    
    return x

```

This corrected version converts the input `x` to a float array at the beginning of the function using `astype('float32')`. This ensures that all subsequent operations, such as subtraction and division, are performed with float values, avoiding the UFuncTypeError.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
