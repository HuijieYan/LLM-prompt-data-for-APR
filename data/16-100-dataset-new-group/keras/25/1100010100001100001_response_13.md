The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function seems to be related to the calculation of mean and standard deviation values for different modes and data formats. Given the runtime input and output values, it is observed that the function is not correctly preprocessing the input array according to the specified mode. Specifically, the condition for mode 'tf' is not being handled correctly, and the mean and standard deviation values are not applied properly for the other modes and data formats. Also, the data format validation for 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the following corrections can be made in the function:
1. Add a condition for handling mode 'tf' specifically.
2. Correct the calculation of mean and standard deviation values for different modes and data formats.
3. Adjust the data format validation for 'channels_first' and 'channels_last'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:  # mode == 'caffe'
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
    return x
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly handles the different modes and data formats, applying the mean and standard deviation values as per the specified mode. Additionally, the data format validation is adjusted to correctly handle both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' formats.
