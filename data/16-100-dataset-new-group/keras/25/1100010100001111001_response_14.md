The issue with the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is that the calculations for 'mean' and 'std' are not being applied correctly when `mode` is 'torch' or if `data_format` is 'channels_first'. The calculations for adjusting the color channels are incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function needs to apply the correct operations for normalization and zero-centering according to the different modes and data formats.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] -= mean[0]
                x[1] -= mean[1]
                x[2] -= mean[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
            
            if std is not None:
                x[0] /= std[0]
                x[1] /= std[1]
                x[2] /= std[2]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values for all the given test cases.
