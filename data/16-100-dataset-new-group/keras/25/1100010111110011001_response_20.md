        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

In the code above, I made the following changes:
1. Changed the division and subtraction operations for 'tf' mode to use the float division and subtraction, as the input array type is `float`.
2. Changed the `mode` condition from using an `if` structure to using `if-elif-else` structure to ensure that only one block of code executes based on the `mode`.
3. Updated the index slicing for 'BGR' conversion to correct the order of the color channels.
4. Moved the subtraction and division operations outside the conditional blocks to apply them universally after the color channel conversion (if necessary).

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output for the given input values.
