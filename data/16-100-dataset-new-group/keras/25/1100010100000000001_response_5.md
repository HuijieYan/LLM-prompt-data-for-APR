## Potential Errors and Explanation of the Bug
1. The function does not handle the 'caffe' mode, which is expected based on the function's description.
2. The function is missing a conditional check for the 'caffe' mode.
3. The bug causes the function to fail in handling the 'caffe' mode, leading to incorrect preprocessing for this mode.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Add a conditional check for the 'caffe' mode and implement the preprocessing steps as described in the function's description.
2. Ensure that all modes are properly handled and return the preprocessed Numpy array.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
