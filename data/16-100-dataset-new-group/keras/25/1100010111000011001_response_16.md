The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is in the logic for handling the 'torch' mode. When `mode` is set to 'torch', the function correctly scales the input pixels between 0 and 1 but fails to normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset. The `mean` and `std` values are not utilized in the normalization process.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for the 'torch' mode to include the normalization step using the `mean` and `std` values specified in the function. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
