The error message indicates a "UFuncTypeError" that suggests an issue with the data types (dtype) of the input arrays. The error is specifically occurring at line 82, where an arithmetic operation is being performed on the input array "x" with data type int32 and the variable "mean" which may have a different data type.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the data type conversions properly. When input "x" has dtype int32, the subsequent calculations result in a mismatch of data types, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, a strategy is required to ensure that the input array and the variables used for arithmetic operations have compatible data types. One approach would be to cast the mean variable to the same data type as the input array "x" before performing the calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        mean = np.array(mean, dtype=x.dtype)  # Ensure mean has the same dtype as x
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        std = np.array(std, dtype=x.dtype)  # Ensure std has the same dtype as x
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        mean = np.array(mean, dtype=x.dtype)  # Ensure mean has the same dtype as x
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
    return x
```

In this corrected version, the mean and std lists are first converted to numpy arrays with the same data type as the input array "x" to ensure compatibility. Then, the calculations are performed accordingly. Additionally, I have also replaced the division operation with the equivalent numpy `/` operator to ensure that type conversion is handled correctly.
