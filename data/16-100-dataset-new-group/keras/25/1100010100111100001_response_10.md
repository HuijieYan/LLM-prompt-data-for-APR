The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function seems to be related to the different data types being used for the input arrays `x`.

The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'`. This suggests that the function is trying to perform an operation that results in a mismatch of data types. This aligns with the inconsistency observed in the runtime values of the input and output arrays.

The most likely cause of the bug is converting `x` to a float array in some conditions, but in others, it remains an array of type 'int32', leading to type casting errors.

To fix the bug, the function should ensure that the `x` array is consistently cast to a float array before performing any operations on it. This can be achieved by using `x = x.astype('float32')` within the function, guaranteeing that `x` is always of type float.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
