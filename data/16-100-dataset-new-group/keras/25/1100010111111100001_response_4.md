The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is causing a `UFuncTypeError` because it is trying to perform operations on arrays of different data types. Specifically, the bug is occurring when trying to subtract the mean pixel values from the input array `x` that has been converted to a floating-point array, but the mean pixel values are stored in a list and not converted to the same data type as the input. This leads to the `UFuncTypeError` when trying to subtract the mean from the input array.

To fix this bug, the mean and standard deviation values should be converted to the same data type as the input array `x` before performing operations on it. The corrected version of the function should also ensure that the mean and standard deviation values are broadcasted appropriately when subtracting and dividing the input array.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float32
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float32')  # Convert mean to float32
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float32')   # Convert std to float32
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float32
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')  # Convert mean to float32
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean  # Subtract mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std  # Divide by std
    return x
```

With these corrections, the function should now be able to handle input arrays of different data types without causing a `UFuncTypeError` and pass the failing test.
