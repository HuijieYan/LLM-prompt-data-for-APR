The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it does not correctly handle the input for the 'caffe' mode when the data_format is 'channels_last'. The function should convert the images from RGB to BGR, then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.

The bug is caused by the incorrect processing of the input array when the mode is 'caffe' and the data format is 'channels_last'. When calculating the mean and subtracting it from the input array, the channels are not rearranged from RGB to BGR as required for the 'caffe' mode. This results in incorrect preprocessing for the 'caffe' mode with 'channels_last' data format.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly rearrange the channels from RGB to BGR when the input array is in 'channels_last' format and the mode is 'caffe'.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, :, :]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean[0]
        if std is not None:
            x /= std[0]
    else:
        x -= mean[0]
        if std is not None:
            x /= std[0]
    return x
```

This corrected code correctly handles the 'caffe' mode for both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats and should now pass the failing tests.
