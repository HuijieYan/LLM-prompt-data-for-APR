Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The calculation of the preprocessed array for the 'torch' mode does not include the normalization step using the mean and standard deviation values.
2. The array manipulation for 'channels_first' data format is not implemented correctly.

Cause of the bug:
The bug causes the function to return an incorrectly preprocessed array, especially for the 'torch' mode and 'channels_first' data format.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to ensure the correct preprocessing steps for all modes and data formats, including the mean and standard deviation normalization step for the 'torch' mode, and the array manipulation for 'channels_first' data format.

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
