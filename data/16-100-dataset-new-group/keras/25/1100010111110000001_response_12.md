The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it does not handle the case when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' correctly.

The cause of the bug is that when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function tries to subtract mean from the input array `x`. Because of this, the function is encountering a numpy type error when trying to subtract `mean[0]` from `x[..., 0]` because `mean` is of type float and `x` is of type int32.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the 'caffe' mode correctly by first converting the images from RGB to BGR, then zero-centering each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling, as specified in the mode.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
    x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
    data_format: Data format of the image array.
    mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                    then will zero-center each color channel with
                    respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                    without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
            sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
            will normalize each channel with respect to the
            ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
    Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            x -= [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]  # Zero-center by mean pixel
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            x -= [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]  # Zero-center by mean pixel
        return x
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the caffe mode correctly and the tests should pass without any errors.
