The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that when the `mode` variable is not 'tf' or 'torch', the mean and std variables are not executed properly. The bug also affects the `if` statement for the `data_format` variable, where the conversion from 'RGB' to 'BGR' is not handled correctly. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mean` and `std` variables are properly calculated for all modes, and the data format conversion is handled correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```
In this corrected version:
1. The conditions for 'tf' and 'torch' modes are properly handled, and the mean and std variables are calculated accordingly.
2. The data format conversion is handled correctly based on the conditions for different modes and data formats.

This corrected version should address the bug that was present in the original function.
