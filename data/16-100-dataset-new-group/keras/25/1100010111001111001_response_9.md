This buggy function is intended to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified mode and data format. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the preprocessed array, particularly when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement for handling the 'caffe' mode in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function does not properly transform the input array according to the specified data format. Additionally, the division by the mean and standard deviation values does not occur as intended in all cases.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be to restructure the conditional statements for handling the different modes and data formats, ensuring that the transformations and calculations occur correctly for each case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:  # 'caffe' mode
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, :]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

    return x
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now properly handle the different modes and data formats, allowing the failing test cases to pass and satisfying the expected input/output values.
