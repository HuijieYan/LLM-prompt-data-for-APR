The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is related to the conditional logic for the `mode` and `data_format` parameters. When the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', and the `data_format` is 'channels_first', the image array is not correctly preprocessed. This leads to incorrect value assignments while zero-centering and normalizing the input array, causing the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we should refactor the conditional logic to properly handle the preprocessing based on the given `mode` and `data_format` parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # fixed the indexing to correctly reverse the channels
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    std = None
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```

With this fix, the conditional logic is modified to correctly handle the preprocessing based on the provided `mode` and `data_format` parameters. Now the images will be correctly preprocessed according to the specified format and mode, and the failing tests should pass.
