To fix the buggy function, the discrepancies between the expected and actual returned values should be addressed. 

The bug is located in the _preprocess_numpy_input function. When mode is 'caffe' and data_format is 'channels_last', the mean value is not being subtracted from the input array x. 

To fix this bug, the mean value should be subtracted from the input array x when mode is 'caffe' and data_format is 'channels_last'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe' and data_format == 'channels_last':
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
        x -= mean
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
