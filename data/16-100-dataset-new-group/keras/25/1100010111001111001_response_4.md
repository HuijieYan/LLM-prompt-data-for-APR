The cause of the bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that the calculations for the `mean` and `std` values for the 'caffe' and 'torch' modes are only handled if the input `x` is not in the 'tf' mode. This means that for 'tf' mode, the mean and std values are not being computed and applied to the input, which results in incorrect preprocessing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean and std values are calculated and applied to the input for all three modes - 'caffe', 'tf', and 'torch'. We can also simplify the code by separating the preprocessing steps for each mode into their own sections and removing unnecessary nested conditionals.

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            x[..., i] /= std[i]
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
    else:
        x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'

    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        for i in range(3):
            x[:, i, :, :] -= mean[i]
    else:
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]

    return x
```

This corrected version of the function separates the preprocessing steps for each mode into their own sections and ensures that the mean and std values are correctly calculated and applied for all three modes. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
