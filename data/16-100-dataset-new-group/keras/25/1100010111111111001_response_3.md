The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function seems to be related to the datatype of the input array `x`. The function is performing operations that cause a change in datatype (from `int32` to `float32`), which is not handled properly for all modes and data formats.

The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError`, specifically a casting error when trying to subtract the mean from `x` with datatype `int32` in the last dimension (i.e., `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`).

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the datatype is consistent throughout the function and that the operations are handled properly for both integer and float arrays.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = np.array(x[..., ::-1], dtype=np.float32)
        else:
            x = np.array(x[:, :, ::-1], dtype=np.float32)
        
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```

By explicitly converting the input `x` to a float array and explicitly defining the mean and std arrays with the `np.array` method, we can ensure that the operations are consistent and handled correctly for both integer and float arrays. This should resolve the casting error and make the function work as expected for all input cases.
