## Analysis
The potential error locations within the buggy function are the 'if' conditions and the calculations that follow.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the 'mode' parameter. Specifically, the calculation for 'tf' and 'torch' modes is not properly separated. The code for handling the 'else' condition also seems to have some issues.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the 'if' conditions need to be properly separated and the calculations for each 'mode' should be separated into their respective blocks. Additionally, the 'else' condition needs to be reviewed and corrected to handle the scenario properly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        return ((x / 255) - 0.5) * 2

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            x[..., i] /= std[i]
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            if mode != 'tf':  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
        else:
            if mode != 'tf':  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        if mode != 'tf':  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
    
    if mode != 'tf':
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]

    return x
