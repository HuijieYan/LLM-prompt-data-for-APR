The bug occurs in the `mode == 'caffe'` condition, where the `mean` values are subtracted from the input array `x`. This causes the values to be incorrect.

The bug also affects the `data_format` conditions and the calculations of the mean and std values. The calculations of mean and std are incorrect for different modes and data formats.

To fix the bug, we need to update the calculations of the mean and std based on the `mode` and `data_format`, and perform the correct operations on the input array `x`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] -= 103.939
                x[1] -= 116.779
                x[2] -= 123.68
            else:
                x[:, 0] -= 103.939
                x[:, 1] -= 116.779
                x[:, 2] -= 123.68
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 103.939
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 123.68

    if std is not None:
        x /= std[0]

    return x
```
In this corrected version, the calculations of mean and std are appropriately handled based on the `mode` and `data_format`, and the operations on the input array `x` are consistent with the specified conditions.
