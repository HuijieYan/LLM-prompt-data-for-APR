The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it does not apply the specified preprocessing according to the 'mode' parameter. Additionally, there are issues with the dimensions and data format handling.

The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect handling of the 'mode' parameter and the data format when the 'mode' is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly apply the preprocessing based on the 'mode' parameter, and also properly handle the data format specified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)

    if mode == 'tf':
        x = (x / 127.5) - 1.0
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:  # mode is caffe
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

This corrected version takes into account the 'mode' parameter and applies the corresponding preprocessing. It also correctly handles the data format by checking the 'data_format' parameter and adjusting the input array accordingly.
