The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it is not handling the `mode` input correctly. When the `mode` is 'torch' or a format other than 'tf', it does not properly process the input array `x`.

The cause of the bug is in the handling of the `else` condition when `mode` is not 'tf'. The calculations for zero-centering by mean pixel are not correctly handling the data format and do not take into account the `mean` and `std` values. This causes a numpy error when trying to subtract and divide elements of the input array `x` using mean and std values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the zero-centering calculations for the `else` condition and make sure it properly handles the `mean` and `std` values according to the given `data_format`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
    return x
```

With this correction, the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should now handle the mean and std calculations correctly for the given `data_format` and `mode`.
