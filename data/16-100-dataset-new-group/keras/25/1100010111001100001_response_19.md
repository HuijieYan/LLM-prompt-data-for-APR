The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the conditional logic for mode 'torch'. The code has a conditional block that applies when mode is 'torch', but the pre-processing steps are not included within the if block. As a result, the function incorrectly processes the input for mode 'torch' and returns an incorrect preprocessed Numpy array.

The suggested fix is to include the preprocessing steps within the conditional block for mode 'torch', and add the corresponding processing logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        
        # Preprocessing steps for torch
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0] * 255
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1] * 255
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2] * 255
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0] * 255
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1] * 255
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2] * 255
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0] * 255
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1] * 255
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2] * 255
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0] * 255
                x[..., 1] /= std[1] * 255
                x[..., 2] /= std[2] * 255
        
        return x

    else:  # mode == 'caffe'
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        
        # Zero-center by mean pixel
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        return x
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
