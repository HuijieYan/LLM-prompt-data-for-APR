The bug in the function is that it does not correctly preprocess the input array `x` according to the specified `mode` and `data_format`. The `mode` argument is used to determine how the image preprocessing should occur, and the `data_format` argument is used to determine the color channel ordering. 

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the 'caffe' mode correctly when the data format is 'channels_last'. The function should convert the images from RGB to BGR and then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling.

To fix the bug, we need to add an `if` condition to handle the 'caffe' mode when `data_format` is 'channels_last'. Then we can apply the necessary operations on the input array `x` and return the preprocessed array.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

        Preprocessed Numpy array.

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly preprocess the input array based on the specified mode and data format, satisfying all the given test cases.
