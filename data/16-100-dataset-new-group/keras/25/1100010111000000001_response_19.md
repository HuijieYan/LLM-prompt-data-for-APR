First, let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test:
The failing test `test_preprocess_input()` is testing the `utils.preprocess_input()` function with image inputs and checking if the output shapes and values are as expected.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the condition checks for `mode` and `data_format`, and the calculations to preprocess the input array `x`.

The cause of the bug, given the failing test, is that the preprocessing of the input array `x` is not producing the expected output shapes and values for different `mode` and `data_format` parameters.

A strategy for fixing the bug could be to carefully review the preprocessing calculations in the `_preprocess_numpy_input()` function and make sure that they are computing the correct transformations for different modes and data formats.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input()` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format='channels_last', mode='caffe'):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.0
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:  # mode == 'caffe'
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        x -= mean

    return x
```
In the corrected version, I have fixed the condition checks for `mode` and the calculations to preprocess the input array `x` based on different modes and data formats. I also added default values for `data_format` and `mode` parameters to make them optional.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_preprocess_input()`.
