To fix the bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, we need to address the incorrect calculations and handling of mean and standard deviation for different data formats and modes.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly processes the input array x based on the mode and data_format. This results in the output not matching the expected preprocessed array. The function incorrectly calculates the mean and standard deviation, resulting in incorrect preprocessing.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional statements and calculations for each mode and data_format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...] if x.ndim == 4 else x[:, ::-1]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x -= np.array(mean)[:, None, None]  # subtract mean for each channel
        else:
            x -= mean
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

This corrected function should produce the expected preprocessed array for different modes and data_formats, and pass the failing test.
