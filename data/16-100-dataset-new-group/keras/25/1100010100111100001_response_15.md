The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function seems to be caused by the inconsistency between input data types (int32) and the operations being performed (often on float32 or float64 arrays). This is causing a UFuncTypeError when trying to subtract the mean values (which are of type float) from the input array (which is of type int32).

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to float before performing the arithmetic operations. We can do this using the `astype` method to cast `x` to float32 before performing operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # ... (further unchanged code)

    return x
``` 

With this correction, the function should now handle different input types and perform the necessary arithmetic operations without error. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
