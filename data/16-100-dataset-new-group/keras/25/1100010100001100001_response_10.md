The issue with the provided function is that the preprocessing step for the 'caffe' mode is not properly implemented in the cases where the data format is 'channels_first'. The mean and standard deviation adjustment is not applied correctly, resulting in incorrect preprocessing of the input array.

Given the runtime input/output values, it is clear that the bug occurs when the data format is 'channels_first' and the mode is 'caffe'.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to properly handle the mean and standard deviation adjustments for both 'channels_last' and 'channels_first' data formats when the mode is 'caffe'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
        
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x

    if mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            return x
        else:
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            return x
```

In the corrected version, we've added an additional condition specifically for the 'caffe' mode and included proper mean adjustment based on the data format. This should resolve the bug and ensure correct preprocessing for the given images.
