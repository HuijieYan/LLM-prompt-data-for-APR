The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect handling of the input array, specifically when the `mode` is not equal to 'tf' or 'torch'. The mean and std computations are not implemented correctly in these cases, leading to incorrect preprocessing.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly implement the mean subtraction and scaling based on the given `mode`, `data_format`, and input array `x`. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x -= mean
        x /= std
        return x
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= 103.939
            x[1, :, :] -= 116.779
            x[2, :, :] -= 123.68
            return x
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
            return x
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= 103.939
        x[..., 1] -= 116.779
        x[..., 2] -= 123.68
        return x
```

With this modification, the function now correctly handles the preprocessing based on the input mode and data format. The mean and standard deviation are subtracted and divided appropriately, ensuring that the output is correctly preprocessed based on the provided mode and data format.
