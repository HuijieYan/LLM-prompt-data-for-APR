The error is occurring in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, specifically when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the `data_format` is not 'channels_first'. It is trying to subtract an array of mean values from the input array `x` which is not aligned, leading to a casting error.

To fix the bug, we need to check the `data_format` before performing the subtraction operation, as well as correct the alignment of the input array.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_last':
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            mean = [123.68, 116.779, 103.939]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
  
    return x
```

In this corrected version, the input array `x` is aligned based on the `data_format` before performing the subtraction. This ensures that the array shapes are compatible and the subtraction operation can be performed without any casting error.
