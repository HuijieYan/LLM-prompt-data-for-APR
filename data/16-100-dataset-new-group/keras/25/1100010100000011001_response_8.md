The bug in the provided function is causing the incorrect preprocessing of the input array, leading to unexpected results. The bug occurs in the 'torch' mode, where the mean and standard deviation are not being properly applied to the input array.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the mean and standard deviation are applied correctly to the input array when the 'torch' mode is selected. Additionally, we should ensure that the data format is properly handled for both 'channels_first' and other formats. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0] * 255
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1] * 255
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2] * 255

            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= (std[0] * 255)
                x[1, :, :] /= (std[1] * 255)
                x[2, :, :] /= (std[2] * 255)
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0] * 255
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1] * 255
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2] * 255

            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= (std[0] * 255)
                x[..., 1] /= (std[1] * 255)
                x[..., 2] /= (std[2] * 255)

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```
With these updates, the function should now properly preprocess the input array according to the specified mode and data format, and satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test case.
