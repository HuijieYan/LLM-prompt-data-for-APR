The error occurs when the function `utils.preprocess_input(xint).shape` is called. The error message indicates that there is a "UFuncTypeError" related to a casting issue between 'float64' and 'int32' data types, specifically in the line `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`. This indicates that there is a mismatch between the data types, causing the subtraction operation to fail due to improper casting.

The bug is caused by performing arithmetic operations on arrays with different data types: subtracting an array of data type 'float64' from an array of data type 'int32'. This causes a casting error because the two arrays have different data types, preventing the subtraction operation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data types of arrays involved in arithmetic operations are compatible. We can accomplish this by explicitly converting the arrays to a consistent data type before performing the operation.

Therefore, the correct version of the function should ensure that arrays are converted to a consistent data type before arithmetic operations are performed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x.astype('float64')  # Convert to a consistent data type

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float64')  # Convert to a consistent data type
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x = x.astype('float64')  # Convert to a consistent data type
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float64')  # Convert to a consistent data type
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

With this corrected version, the function should now be able to handle arrays with different data types without causing a casting error.
