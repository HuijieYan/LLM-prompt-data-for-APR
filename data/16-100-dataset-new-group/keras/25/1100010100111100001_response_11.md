The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it does not handle the input array `x` properly for the `'caffe'` mode when the `data_format` is `'channels_first'`. This is causing a UFuncTypeError when trying to subtract the mean values from the input array.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for the different shape and indexing of the input array when `data_format` is `'channels_first'`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle the `'channels_first'` data format properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
                mean = None
                std = None
            else:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
                mean = None
                std = None
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the input array `x`, the `data_format`, and the `mode` properly, and it should pass the failing test.
