The issue with the buggy function is that the conditions for the 'tf' and 'torch' modes are not properly accounted for, resulting in incorrect preprocessing for the images.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditions for the 'tf' and 'torch' modes and ensure that the preprocessing is correctly applied for each mode.

Here is the fixed version of the function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x -= mean
        else:
            x -= mean
    return x
```
In this corrected version, we have changed the conditions for the 'tf' and 'torch' modes and updated the preprocessing steps within those conditions. Additionally, we have made the mean subtraction conditional on the number of dimensions of the input array.
