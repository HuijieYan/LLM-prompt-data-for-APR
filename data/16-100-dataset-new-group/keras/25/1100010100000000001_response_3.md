## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The `else` block is missing after `mode == 'torch'` block which might cause the function to execute the wrong block of code.
2. The function does not return the preprocessed array for the 'torch' mode.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function:

The bug occurs because the function is missing the `else` block after `mode == 'torch'` which could lead to improper preprocessing. Additionally, the function does not return the preprocessed array for the 'torch' mode.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Add the missing `else` block after the `mode == 'torch'` block to ensure proper conditional execution.
2. Add a return statement for the preprocessed array in the 'torch' mode.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
