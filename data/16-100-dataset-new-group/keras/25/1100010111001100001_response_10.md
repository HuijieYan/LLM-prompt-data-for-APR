The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function involves the incorrect calculation of the preprocessing steps for the 'tf' and 'torch' modes. After analyzing the failing tests and the runtime input/output values, it's clear that the bug causes incorrect preprocessing for these modes, leading to failing tests.

The bug is caused by the incorrect assignment of the mean and standard deviation values based on the mode, and also by the incorrect scaling and normalization operations. 

To fix the bug, the function should correctly calculate the preprocessing steps for the 'tf' and 'torch' modes and also handle the standard deviation values if they are not `None`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
            
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the preprocessing steps are correctly applied based on the mode and data format, and it will pass the failing test cases.
