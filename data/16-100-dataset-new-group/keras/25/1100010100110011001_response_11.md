The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is likely due to the data types of the input being inconsistent with the operations being performed, leading to a UFuncTypeError. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data types of the inputs and outputs are compatible with the operations being performed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float to avoid data type conflicts
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float32')
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float32')
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')
            std = None
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    return x
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly convert the input data to type 'float32' to support the division and subtraction operations without causing data type conflicts. Additionally, we use NumPy arrays for `mean` and `std` to ensure type consistency and avoid UFuncTypeError.
