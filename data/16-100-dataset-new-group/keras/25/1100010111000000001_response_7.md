The bug in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is that it doesn't handle the case when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' correctly. It skips the correct preprocessing steps and tries to apply them without proper conditions, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug:
- Add proper condition checks for 'caffe' mode and default case
- For 'caffe' mode, handle the conversion from RGB to BGR and zero-centering each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling
- For the default case, handle the RGB to BGR conversion and zero-centering based on the data format

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std  # Apply normalization
    else:  # 'caffe' or default case
        # Convert RGB to BGR
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean  # Zero-centering
        std = None

    # Normalize
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

The corrected function applies the proper preprocessing steps based on the `mode` and `data_format` conditions, and is expected to pass the failing test provided.
