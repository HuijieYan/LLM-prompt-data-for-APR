The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function seems to be related to the standardization and preprocessing of the input data according to different modes and data formats. The bug could be causing issues in the output of the function when used with different data formats and modes.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Missing calculation for standardization in the tf mode.
2. Incorrect handling of data format in the torch mode.
3. Possible indexing errors in the Zero-centering by mean pixel section.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of data standardization and data format conversion in different modes, as well as a potential error in the zero-centering calculation for different data formats.

A strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the standardization and preprocessing steps are correctly implemented according to the modes and data formats specified. Additionally, the zero-centering calculations should be modified to accommodate different data formats.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that the standardization and zero-centering calculations are performed correctly based on the specified mode and data format. This should address the issues and make the function work as intended.
