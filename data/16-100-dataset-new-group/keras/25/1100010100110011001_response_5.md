To fix the bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, we need to address the error message pertaining to the casting of 'float64' to 'int32'. This error occurs when the `mode` is set to 'torch', which incorrectly performs operations on the input array `x` as if it were an integer array.

We can fix this bug by ensuring that the input array `x` is treated as a float array if the `mode` is set to 'torch'. This will prevent any casting issues when performing arithmetic operations on the array.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float array
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

With this correction, the function will handle the input array appropriately based on the specified `mode`, and the corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
