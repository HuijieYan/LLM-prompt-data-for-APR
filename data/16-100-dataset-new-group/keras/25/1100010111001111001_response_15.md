The issue is with the calculation of the preprocessed Numpy array in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. Specifically, the issue lies in the if-else conditions for the `mode` and `data_format` parameters. 

The problem arises from the fact that the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation are performed without appropriately checking for the shape and data format of the input array. This causes incorrect preprocessing and results in failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that mean subtraction and division by standard deviation are performed in a way that accounts for the shape, data format, and mode of the input array.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])

        # Normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x

    # mode is 'caffe'
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]

    mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
    
    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean

    return x
```

This corrected version includes proper handling of the `mode`, `data_format`, and input array shape to ensure that the preprocessing is done correctly. You can test this corrected version with the failing test cases provided to verify that it passes all the tests.
