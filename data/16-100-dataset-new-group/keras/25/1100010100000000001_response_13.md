## Bug Analysis
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. In the 'if mode == 'torch'' block, the 'mean' and 'std' arrays are being defined, but they are not being used to modify the input 'x'.
2. In the 'else' block, the 'mean' and 'std' arrays are being defined for the 'data_format == 'channels_first'' condition, but they are not being used to modify the input 'x' in a consistent manner.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the 'mean' and 'std' values in the 'if mode == 'torch'' block, as well as the inconsistency in using the 'mean' and 'std' arrays in the 'else' block for different conditions of 'data_format'.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'mean' and 'std' values are correctly applied to the input 'x' based on the conditions specified in the function. Additionally, the usage of 'mean' and 'std' arrays should be consistent for different conditions of 'data_format'.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std  # Apply mean and std correction

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

        if std is not None:
            x /= std
        x -= mean  # Apply mean correction

    return x
