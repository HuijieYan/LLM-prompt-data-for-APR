The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function seems to be related to the computation of the mean and standard deviation values, as well as the manipulation of the input array `x` based on the `data_format` and `mode` parameters. 

The cause of the bug can be identified in the `if mode == 'torch':` block, where the computation of mean and standard deviation is not followed by any operations on the input array `x`. This is resulting in the incorrect preprocessed array when `mode` is set to 'torch'.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is modified appropriately within the `if mode == 'torch':` block based on the computed mean and standard deviation values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            for i in range(3):
                x[i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                x[i, :, :] /= std[i]
        else:
            for i in range(3):
                x[:, :, i] -= mean[i]
                x[:, :, i] /= std[i]

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

In this corrected version, when `mode` is set to 'torch', the input array `x` is normalized and then each channel is normalized with respect to the ImageNet dataset, based on the computed mean and standard deviation values. This modification ensures that the function will now return the correct preprocessed array for the given input cases.
