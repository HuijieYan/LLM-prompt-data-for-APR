Potential Error Locations:
1. The `if` statement for the 'torch' mode does not include any return statements, so the function will continue executing the code after that block even though it should return the preprocessed array.
2. There are potential issues in the calculations for mean and std in the 'torch' mode.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not return the preprocessed array when the mode is set to 'torch'. Additionally, the mean and std calculations in the 'torch' mode may not be correct.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a return statement after the 'torch' mode calculations to return the preprocessed array.
2. Verify the correctness of the mean and std calculations for the 'torch' mode.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
