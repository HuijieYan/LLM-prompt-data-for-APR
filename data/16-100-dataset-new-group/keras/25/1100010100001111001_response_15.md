The bug in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is causing incorrect preprocessing of the input array `x` based on the given 'mode' and 'data_format'. The bug is particularly seen introducing incorrect normalization and mean subtraction for the input array. This is violating the expected values for a specific 'mode' and 'data_format', leading to incorrect output for each input case.

The cause of this bug is primarily due to the way conditional statements are being used to check the value of 'mode' and perform operations based on it. For 'tf' and 'torch' modes, the normalization and mean subtraction operations are correctly performed. However, for the 'caffe' mode, the normalization and mean subtraction operations are not being correctly performed, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to specifically handle the 'caffe' mode to perform the correct normalization and mean subtraction operations based on the given 'data_format' as well.

Below is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[:, 0] -= 123.68
            x[:, 1] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2] -= 103.939
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 123.68
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 103.939
        return x
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid mode. Mode must be one of 'caffe', 'tf', or 'torch'.")
```
In the modified code, the 'caffe' mode is handled specifically for the given 'data_format' to correctly perform the normalization and mean subtraction operations, satisfying the expected output for each input case.
