The issue with the current _preprocess_numpy_input function is that it does not handle the 'torch' mode correctly. The 'torch' mode should scale the pixels between 0 and 1 and then normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset. However, the function does not implement this correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for the 'torch' mode.

To fix this bug, we need to implement the correct preprocessing steps for the 'torch' mode. Specifically, we need to scale the pixels between 0 and 1 and then normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset.

Below is the corrected version of the _preprocess_numpy_input function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch': 
        x /= 255.0 # Scale pixels between 0 and 1
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        return x

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged for other modes (e.g. 'caffe')

```

The corrections made in the function address the issue by correctly implementing the preprocessing steps for the 'torch' mode, satisfying the expected input/output values for the failing test.
