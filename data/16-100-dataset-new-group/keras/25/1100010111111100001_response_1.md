The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it is incorrectly handling the input `x` when the `mode` is set to 'torch' or the `data_format` is set to 'channels_first'. The bug is causing the function to fail when it tries to operate on the elements of `x` with `mean` and `std` values.

The bug is occurring because the function treats `x` as an integer array, but then it attempts to perform floating-point operations on it, leading to a type error. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `x` is converted to a floating-point array before being processed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

By converting the `x` array to a floating-point array at the beginning of the function, we avoid the type error that was occurring, and the function should now work as intended.
