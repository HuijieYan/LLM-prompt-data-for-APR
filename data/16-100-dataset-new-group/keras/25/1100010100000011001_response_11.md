The issue with the provided function is that the `if mode == 'torch'` block is not being properly handled, leading to incorrect preprocessing for the torch mode. In this case, the mean and standard deviation values are not being correctly applied to the input array.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the mean and standard deviation values are correctly applied when the mode is set to 'torch'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x -= mean # Zero-center by mean pixel
        x /= std # Normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        x = x[..., ::-1]
    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    std = None
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
``` 

This corrected version properly applies the mean and standard deviation values based on the mode specified, ensuring that the preprocessing is correctly handled for the torch mode as well as the other modes.
