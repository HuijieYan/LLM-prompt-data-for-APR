To fix the bug in the "_preprocess_numpy_input" function, we need to address the conditional logic based on the "mode" parameter. It seems that the conditional branch for "tf" mode is correctly implemented, but the branches for "torch" and other modes need to be corrected.

In the provided runtime and expected cases, the input parameter values and types, and the expected values and types of relevant variables are given. The main issue in the current implementation seems to be in the conditional logic for different modes. The "torch" mode is not handled correctly, and there are issues with "channels_first" and "channels_last" data formats.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve refining the conditional logic to properly handle all mode and data format combinations and ensure that the preprocessing is applied correctly based on the provided parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            for i in range(3):
                x[i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                x[i, :, :] /= std[i]
        else:
            for i in range(3):
                x[:, :, i] -= mean[i]
                x[:, :, i] /= std[i]
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        x = x[..., ::-1]
    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        for i in range(3):
            x[i, :, :] -= mean[i]
    else:
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
    return x
```

This corrected version should handle the different modes and data formats as specified and should pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
