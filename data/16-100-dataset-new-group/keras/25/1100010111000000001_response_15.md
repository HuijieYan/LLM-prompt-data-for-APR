The issue with the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function seems to be in the handling of different data formats and modes. The function is failing to correctly preprocess the input array based on the data format and mode specified.

The potential error location is in the conditional checks for the mode and the data format, as well as the calculations for mean and std.

The cause of the bug is likely that the calculations for mean and std are not being applied correctly based on the specified mode and data format. Additionally, the handling of channels_first and channels_last formats appears to be incorrect.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to properly handle the conditional checks for 'tf' and 'torch' modes, as well as for different data formats. Additionally, ensure that the mean and std adjustments are accurately applied based on the selected mode and data format.

Here's a corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1, sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x -= np.array(mean)[:, None, None]
            x /= np.array(std)[:, None, None]
        else:
            x -= np.array(mean)
            x /= np.array(std)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        if std is not None:
            x -= np.array(mean)
            x /= np.array(std)

    return x
```

This corrected version handles the different modes and data formats correctly, applying the mean and std adjustments based on the selected mode and format. The use of np.array ensures the proper application of adjustments across different axes.
