The buggy function is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the given data format and mode. It appears that the bug may be related to an incorrect implementation of the preprocessing steps based on the specified mode.

The issue is evident in the 'torch' mode, where the mean and std variables are calculated and applied incorrectly. Additionally, there are potential issues with handling the input array x based on the specified data format.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the preprocessing steps are correctly implemented for all modes, and the handling of the input array x is consistent with the specified data format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x

    # For mode 'caffe' or other modes not specified
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[::-1, ...]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
    else:
        x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
    x -= [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]  # Zero-center by mean pixel
    return x
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- For mode 'tf', the scaling and zero-centering operations are combined into a single step for clarity and consistency.
- For mode 'torch', the scaling and normalization operations are correctly applied based on the mean and std values.
- The handling of the input array x is adjusted to ensure consistency with the specified data format for 'caffe' or other unspecified modes.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
