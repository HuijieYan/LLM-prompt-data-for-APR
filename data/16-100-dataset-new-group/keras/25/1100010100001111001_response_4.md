The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function causes incorrect preprocessing when the mode is 'caffe'. The bug can be attributed to the incorrect calculation of the preprocessed values based on the mode.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves correctly implementing the preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' mode by subtracting the mean and reversing the channel order for the input array.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x
    if mode == 'caffe':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        return x
```

The corrected version now correctly handles the 'caffe' mode by subtracting the mean values and reversing the channel order as required. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function produces the expected output values for each case.
