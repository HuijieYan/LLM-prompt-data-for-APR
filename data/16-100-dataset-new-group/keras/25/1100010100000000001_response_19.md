The potential error in the provided code is in the 'if mode == 'torch'' block. The mean and std values are assigned, but the normalization of the input array 'x' is missing. This causes a bug that leads to incorrect preprocessing when the mode is set to 'torch'.

To fix the bug, the normalization of the input array 'x' needs to be included within the 'if mode == 'torch'' block.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
