The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it doesn't handle the input x when the mode is 'torch' correctly.
When the mode is 'torch', the function tries to normalize the input `x` using the `mean` and `std` arrays, which is correct. However, it doesn't properly handle the normalization for different data formats (`channels_first` or `channels_last`). This leads to a UFuncTypeError when trying to subtract the mean values from the input `x`.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly handle the normalization process based on the input shape and the `data_format`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0] -= mean[0]
            x[1] -= mean[1]
            x[2] -= mean[2]

            if std is not None:
                x[0] /= std[0]
                x[1] /= std[1]
                x[2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]

        return x

    else:
        # Handle 'caffe' mode as before
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] -= mean[0]
                x[1] -= mean[1]
                x[2] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[0] /= std[0]
                    x[1] /= std[1]
                    x[2] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        return x
