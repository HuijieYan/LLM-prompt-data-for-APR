The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is causing the failing test in `imagenet_utils_test.py`. The error message indicates a UFuncTypeError, specifically a casting issue related to the subtraction operation.

The bug appears to occur in the `else` condition of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'. The error stems from the fact that the function involves subtraction operations on the input array `x` with a mean array `mean`. Since `x` is of type `int32`, the subtraction with elements of type `float64` raises the UFuncTypeError.

To fix the bug, the mean array `mean` should be converted to the same data type as the input `x` before performing the subtraction operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32 before further operations
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32 before further operations
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= np.array(mean, dtype='float32')  # Convert mean to float32 before subtraction
    if std is not None:
        x /= np.array(std, dtype='float32')

    return x
```

By using the `astype('float32')` method to convert `x` and `mean` to float32, the bug causing the UFuncTypeError is resolved. This corrected function should now pass the failing test.
