The bug in the _preprocess_numpy_input function lies in the calculation and application of the mean and standard deviation values based on the mode and data format. The code currently does not handle the calculation and application of the mean and standard deviation values correctly. This results in the incorrect preprocessing of the input array 'x'.

The strategy for fixing the bug includes:
1. Applying the correct mean and standard deviation values based on the mode and data format specified.
2. Ensuring that the mean and standard deviation values are applied to the input array 'x' in a manner consistent with the specified data format (channels_first or channels_last).

Here's the corrected version of the _preprocess_numpy_input function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std  # Apply normalization
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = np.transpose(x, (0, 3, 1, 2))  # Convert to channels_first
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    return x
```

With the corrected version of the function, the mean and standard deviation values are correctly applied based on the mode and data format. This should ensure that the function passes the failing test cases.
