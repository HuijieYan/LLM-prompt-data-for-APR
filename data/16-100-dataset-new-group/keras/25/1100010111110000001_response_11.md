The issue is with the data type of the input `xint` in the failing test case. The `xint` array is of type `int32`, and when it is passed to the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, it results in a data type mismatch error when trying to perform arithmetic operations and array assignments based on floating-point numbers.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a floating-point type before any arithmetic operations are performed. This can be achieved using the `.astype('float32')` method on the input array `x` to ensure that it's treated as a floating-point array before the preprocessing operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# corrected function
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert input to float32 type

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

With this corrected version of `_preprocess_numpy_input`, the failing test case should pass without any data type mismatch errors.
