The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by the improper handling of data types and the inconsistent manipulation of the input array based on the data format and mode. This is evident from the error message that indicates a UFuncTypeError when trying to subtract the mean value from the input. Additionally, the function is expected to preprocess the input array according to a specific mode and data format, but it is not doing so correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is being manipulated consistently based on the specified data format and mode. Additionally, we need to handle the data types properly to prevent compatibility issues when performing operations on the input array.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.0
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        x = x - mean

    return x
```

This corrected version ensures that the input array `x` is consistently manipulated based on the specified data format and mode. Additionally, it handles the data types properly to avoid compatibility issues when performing operations on the input array.
