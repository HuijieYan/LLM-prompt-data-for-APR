The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` has a number of potential error sources. Here's a list of the potential issues:

1. In the 'torch' mode, the function multiplies `x` by `mean` and `std` without checking pixel value ranges.
2. In the 'tf' mode, the function divides `x` by 127.5 and then subtracts 1, but this process should occur on a pixel-wise basis.

The cause of the bug in the failing tests could be traced back to the incorrect preprocessing of input images. The failing tests indicate that there is an issue with correctly pre-processing the input images, specifically when using different data formats ('channels_first' or 'channels_last').

To fix the bug, it is important to correctly preprocess the input images according to the specified data format and mode.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format='channels_last', mode='tf'):
    """
    Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        if np.max(x) > 1.0:  # Check if the image values are already in the range [-1, 1]
            x /= 127.5
            x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = np.flip(x, axis=0)
            else:
                x = np.flip(x, axis=1)
        else:
            x = np.flip(x, axis=-1)

        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

In the corrected version, the input array `x` is properly preprocessed based on the 'data_format' and 'mode' parameters. Additionally, the function now checks the range of input pixel values to ensure that the preprocessing is performed correctly.
