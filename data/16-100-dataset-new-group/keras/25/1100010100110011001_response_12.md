The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function occurs when trying to subtract the `mean` values from the input array `x`. The bug is due to a type mismatch between the element types of `x` and `mean`, resulting in a `numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError`. This error occurs because the function is attempting to subtract `mean` (which is a list of floats) from `x` (which is an array of ints). This inconsistency causes the error as it tries to subtract float values from int values.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `mean` values are of the same type as the input array `x`. In this case, we need to convert the `mean` list to an array of the same type as `x` before performing the subtraction.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
