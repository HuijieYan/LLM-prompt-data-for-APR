## Buggy function
The `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is intended to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images. It takes input array `x`, data format of the image array, and mode as parameters. Based on the mode, it applies different preprocessing steps such as converting RGB to BGR, normalizing each color channel, and zero-centering with respect to the ImageNet dataset.

## Analysis
The bug occurs when the mode is set to 'caffe' and the data format is 'channels_last'. The function tries to perform operations on the input array `x` assuming it is a floating-point array, but in some cases, it is an integer array. This results in a `UFuncTypeError` due to type casting issues.

## Bug
The bug is caused by not converting the input array to float type before performing division and subtraction operations.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a float array before any division or subtraction operations are performed.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
