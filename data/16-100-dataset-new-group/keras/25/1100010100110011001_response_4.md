### The analysis of the buggy function and the failing test
The `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is intended to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters. The failing test indicates that there is a type error when the function tries to subtract the mean values from the input array `x` with dtype 'int32'. The failing test also provides the input values for the function parameters.

### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
1. In the 'torch' mode, the function tries to perform operations with the `mean` values on the input array `x`, which can lead to type errors.
2. There are potential issues with the data format handling, depending on the dimensionality of the input array.


### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to perform operations with mean values on an input array `x` of type 'int32', leading to type errors. Additionally, there are potential issues with handling the data format when processing the input array.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the operations with mean values are performed appropriately based on the input array type. Additionally, we need to handle the data format correctly to avoid potential issues, depending on the dimensionality of the input array.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = np.divide(x, 127.5)
        x -= 1
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = np.divide(x, 255.)
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std  # Normalize using mean and std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:  # Perform zero-centering and normalization
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:  # Only perform zero-centering
        x -= mean

    return x
```

In the corrected version, the function now uses NumPy operations to handle the input array `x` appropriately based on its type. Additionally, the handling of the data format has been adjusted to ensure correct processing for different scenarios.
