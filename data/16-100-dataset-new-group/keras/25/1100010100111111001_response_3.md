## Bug Fix
The bug is caused by the operation on the `x` array, leading to a `UFuncTypeError` due to incorrect type conversion. The expected output of the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is a preprocessed Numpy array according to the specified mode and data format.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the data type conversion properly for the `x` array in order to align with the mean and standard deviation values.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the pixel values in the `x` array are converted to the appropriate data type before applying any operations or modifications.

## Fixing the Bug
The following is a corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. It includes proper data type handling for the `x` array to avoid the UFuncTypeError when performing operations and modifications.

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert to float if not already

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.0
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        x /= 255.0
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```

With the corrected function, the pixel values are properly handled and the mean and standard deviation are applied accordingly, addressing the type conversion issue and ensuring that the function returns the expected preprocessed Numpy array.
