### Bug Identification
The bug occurs when the `mode` is not equal to 'tf' or 'torch'. In these cases, the function incorrectly calculates the mean and std values based on the `data_format`. The calculations of mean and std are incorrect, causing the output to deviate from the expected values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to fix the calculations of mean and std when `mode` is not equal to 'tf' or 'torch'. The correct mean and std values need to be applied based on the `data_format` in order to produce the correct output.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            mean = [123.68, 116.779, 103.939]
            std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x

```
In the corrected function, the mean and std are calculated based on the `data_format` when `mode` is not equal to 'tf' or 'torch'. Then, the values are properly applied to the input array `x`. This should produce the expected outputs for each case.
