The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that the if-else conditions are not handling all cases properly. Specifically, when `mode` is set to 'caffe' and the `data_format` is set to 'channels_last', the function should convert the images from RGB to BGR, then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling. However, the function does not perform these operations correctly, leading to incorrect preprocessed Numpy array values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `if mode == 'caffe'` condition to properly handle the specified data format and mode. In this case, it should convert the images from RGB to BGR and then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        # Normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset
        x -= mean
        x /= std
        return x

    if mode == 'caffe':
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            # Zero-center by mean pixel
            for i in range(3):
                x[:, i, :, :] -= mean[i]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            # Zero-center by mean pixel
            for i in range(3):
                x[..., i] -= mean[i]
        return x
```

With this corrected version of the function, the expected input/output values of the described test cases should be satisfied.
