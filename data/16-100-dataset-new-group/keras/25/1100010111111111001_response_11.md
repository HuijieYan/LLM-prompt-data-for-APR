The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function causes an error because when the `mode` is set to 'torch', it divides the input array `x` by 255, and then tries to subtract the `mean` array, which is of type `int`. This causes a type mismatch, leading to the error `UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all arithmetic operations in the function are performed on arrays of the same type. One approach is to convert the `mean` list to a numpy array of the same type as `x` before performing the subtraction.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly converts the `mean` and `std` arrays to the same type as the input `x` before performing any arithmetic operations.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases by satisfying the expected input/output values.
