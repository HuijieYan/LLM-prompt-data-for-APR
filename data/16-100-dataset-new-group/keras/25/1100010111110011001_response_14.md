The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is causing a `UFuncTypeError` during the failing test. The error is occurring due to incorrect data manipulation inside the function, given the specific `int32` input type.

The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the data manipulation is appropriate for the `int32` datatype. Additionally, the function should return the preprocessed Numpy array as expected given the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float32 to prevent UFuncTypeError
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # Reverse channel order
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]  # Reverse channel order
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # Reverse channel order
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean  # Zero-center
    if std is not None:
        x /= std  # Normalize

    return x
```

In the corrected version, the input array `x` is first converted to `float32` to prevent the `UFuncTypeError` when performing calculations. Then, the preprocessing steps are applied according to the specified `mode` and `data_format`.

With the corrected version of the function, it will now pass the failing test and produce the expected output values and types for the given input parameters.
