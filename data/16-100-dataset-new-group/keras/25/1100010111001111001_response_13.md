## The bug
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that the if condition for mode 'caffe' does not correctly implement the image preprocessing operations. These operations are intended to convert the images from RGB to BGR and then perform zero-centering relative to the ImageNet dataset without scaling. This process is not correctly implemented in the function.

## Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the mode is 'caffe' and then implement the specific preprocessing steps for this mode which include converting the images from RGB to BGR and then zero-centering each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling. 

## The corrected function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':  # Fixed the bug here
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid mode. Mode must be one of 'tf', 'torch', or 'caffe'.")

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
``` 

With the corrected function, the specified preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' mode are correctly implemented. The function should now pass the failing test cases and correctly preprocess the input images according to the mode specified.
