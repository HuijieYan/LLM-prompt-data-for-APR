The problem occurs when the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` attempts to perform operations on an integer array with mean and standard deviation values that are floats. The error message indicates that it cannot cast the ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the mean and standard deviation are cast to the same data type as the input array before performing the operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float64')  # convert input to float64
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float64')  # convert mean to float64
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float64')  # convert std to float64
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float64')  # convert mean to float64
        std = None

    # this part of the code remains unchanged

    return x
```

By casting the input to float64 and ensuring that mean and std are also of the same data type, we can address the issue of casting errors and the function should now pass the failing test.
