The issue in the provided code is due to the incorrect data type being used in the computation, resulting in a UFuncTypeError. When the input x is provided in integer format (e.g., xint = x.astype('int32')), the function fails to handle the data type conversion required for the operations performed.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that the input data type is handled properly based on the mode provided and perform the necessary data type conversions before the operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float for processing

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float32')
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float32')
    else:

            else:

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]

    return x
```

In the corrected version, the input data is first converted to float32 prior to the operations, and the mean and std arrays are set to float32 as well. This ensures that the correct data type is maintained during the computations.
