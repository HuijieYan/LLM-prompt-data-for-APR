The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is causing the failing tests because the function is not correctly handling the different data formats and modes, leading to incorrect preprocessing of the input array. The bug is mainly caused by the incorrect handling of the mean and std values and the channel ordering based on the data format.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles the different data formats, including 'channels_first' and 'channels_last'.
2. Update the preprocessing steps for the 'tf' and 'torch' modes to ensure that the input array is scaled and normalized as required.
3. Adjust the channel ordering and mean/std calculations based on the data format to ensure consistency in preprocessing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

With this corrected version, the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should now pass the failing tests and correctly preprocess the input array according to the specified mode and data format.
