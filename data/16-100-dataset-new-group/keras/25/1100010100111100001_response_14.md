The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is in the `else` branch for `mode != 'tf' and mode != 'torch'` because when `data_format` is `channels_last` and `mode` is 'caffe', the array `x` is being divided by the `mean` array, which causes a numpy UFuncTypeError due to the mismatch of data types (float64 vs. int32).

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `mean` is converted to the same data type as `x` before performing the subtraction operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    return x
```

By converting the `mean` array and `std` array to the same data type as `x` before using them for arithmetic operations, the function will now handle both integer and float input arrays, avoiding the UFuncTypeError that was occurring.
