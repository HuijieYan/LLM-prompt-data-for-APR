The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by the fact that the function is not handling the input in the correct format and is trying to apply calculations to an integer array as if it were a float array. This is leading to a 'UFuncTypeError' error, as it is not possible to cast the output from some operations to the integer type of the input array.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array is converted to a float array before any calculations are applied to it. Additionally, the conditional checks within the function need to account for the correct dimensionality of the input array and adjust the calculations accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # convert input array to float array
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first' and x.ndim == 4:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    
    return x
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle both integer and float input arrays, and the UFuncTypeError should be resolved. This should successfully pass the failing test cases.
