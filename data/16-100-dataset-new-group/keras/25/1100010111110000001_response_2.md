The bug in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is causing a `UFuncTypeError` when the input `xint` is passed with `mode='caffe'` and `data_format='channels_last'`. This error occurs because the function is trying to subtract a float value from an integer array, which results in a type casting error.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the array `x` is converted to the appropriate data type (`float32`) before performing any arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float32
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]

            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

After applying these changes, the corrected version of the function should not result in a `UFuncTypeError` and should pass the failing test.
