The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the input array `x` when the `mode` is 'torch'. The function tries to perform arithmetic operations on non-float data, causing a type error. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is cast to the appropriate data type before performing any arithmetic operations. We should also handle the case where the input is 3D and the data format is 'channels_first' correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Cast to float32 to allow arithmetic operations
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float32')  # Cast to float32
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float32')  # Cast to float32
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, :, :]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')  # Cast to float32
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    return x
```

The corrections made include:
- Casting the input array `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function to allow arithmetic operations.
- Using `np.array` to create `mean` and `std` arrays, specifying the data type as `float32` to ensure consistent data types for operations.

These corrections should fix the bug and make the function work as expected for all modes and data formats.
