To fix the bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, we need to address the issues related to the `tf` and `torch` modes and the handling of the input data based on `data_format`. The bug seems to be in the calculations and adjustments of the input array `x` based on the given `mode` and `data_format`.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of the `torch` mode, where the mean and standard deviation are not being used to preprocess the input `x`. Additionally, the data format is not being properly handled, leading to incorrect adjustments in pixel values.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to first categorize the input processing based on the `mode` and then handle the `data_format` accordingly, ensuring that the mean and standard deviation adjustments are applied correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 255.0
        x = (x - 0.5) / 0.5
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.0
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean

    return x
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments for the `tf` and `torch` modes are handled appropriately. Additionally, the `data_format` is considered when applying the adjustments. This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected input/output values.
