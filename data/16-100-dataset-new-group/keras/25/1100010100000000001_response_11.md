The potential error in the given function is that the calculations are not handled consistently for all conditions. When mode is 'torch', the mean and standard deviation are calculated, but the normalization calculations are missing. Additionally, the conditional block for handling the 'tf' mode is missing a portion that should scale the values between -1 and 1 sample-wise.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle all the modes consistently. In the 'torch' mode, the normalization steps are missing, and in the 'tf' mode, part of the scaling calculation is missing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all modes have consistent handling and that the normalization steps are included.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std  # Add normalization step for 'torch' mode
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    x -= mean

    return x
```

In the corrected version, the normalization step has been added for the 'torch' mode, and the conditional block has been adjusted to ensure consistent handling for all modes.
