The bug in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is the incorrect handling of the input array `x` when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'. Instead of performing the intended data preprocessing steps, the function is only updating the variable `x` based on the input mode without properly applying the mean and standard deviation adjustments.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to implement the correct preprocessing steps for the given mode and data format. Specifically, when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function should apply the mean subtraction and standard deviation division to the input array `x` based on the data format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
        
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
    return x
```

This corrected version includes the proper processing steps for each mode and data format combination while considering the mean and standard deviation adjustments. It should satisfy all the failing test cases mentioned.
