The cause of the bug is that the code does not properly handle the 'caffe' mode. When the mode is set to 'caffe', the function should convert the images from RGB to BGR and then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling. However, the current implementation does not include this case, which causes the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to add a conditional block for the 'caffe' mode and implement the required preprocessing steps for this mode.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid mode. Supported modes are 'caffe', 'tf', and 'torch'")

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles the 'caffe' mode and performs the required preprocessing steps, ensuring that it satisfies the expected input/output values for all cases.
