The bug in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is that the conditional blocks for 'torch' mode are implemented incorrectly. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the given input parameters for the 'caffe' mode.

The cause of the bug is that when `mode` is not equal to 'tf' or 'torch', the function incorrectly calculates the `mean` and `std` values. Instead, for the 'caffe' mode, it needs to convert the images from RGB to BGR, and then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.

To fix the bug, the 'caffe' mode should be handled correctly according to the provided description, and the 'torch' mode should be updated to correctly scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x -= mean
        x /= std
        return x
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean
        return x
```

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy all the provided test cases and produce the expected output.
