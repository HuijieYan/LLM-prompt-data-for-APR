The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it does not handle the case when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' properly. It calculates the `mean` and `std` values but does not use them to preprocess the input array `x`. 

To fix this bug, we need to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the input array `x` based on the `data_format` and use them to preprocess `x` when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = np.flip(x, axis=0)
            else:
                x = np.flip(x, axis=1)
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = np.flip(x, axis=-1)
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        # Zero-center by mean pixel and normalize
        if std is not None:
            x = (x - mean) / std
        else:
            x -= mean

    return x
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the `mean` and `std` and use them to preprocess the input array `x` when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', based on the `data_format`. We also use the `numpy` functions to perform the flipping and arithmetic operations on the input array `x`.
