The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is causing a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to subtract the mean value from the input array `x` of type `int32`. This occurs because the function is performing operations on the input without correctly adjusting the data type of the array, leading to the mixed data types within the calculations.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all operations are performed using the same data type as the input array `x`. This can be done by explicitly casting the mean and standard deviation arrays to the same data type as `x` before performing the operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function with the necessary changes:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)  # Cast mean to input data type
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)  # Cast std to input data type
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)  # Cast mean to input data type
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
