The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by the incorrect manipulation of the input array `x` when `mode` is set to either 'tf' or 'torch'. The function is dividing and subtracting from `x` which is not consistent with the expected behavior when `mode` is set to 'tf' or 'torch'.

To fix this bug, we should use the `np.asarray` method to ensure that the input `x` is treated as a NumPy array and then perform the data preprocessing based on the value of `mode`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = np.asarray(x)  # Ensure x is a NumPy array

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

This corrected version of the function uses `np.asarray` to ensure `x` is treated as a NumPy array. Then it performs the necessary preprocessing based on the value of `mode` and `data_format`.

By using `np.array` for the `mean` and `std`, we ensure consistent behavior regardless of the input type.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
