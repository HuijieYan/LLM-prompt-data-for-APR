The bug in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is caused by the incorrect application of the mean and standard deviation normalization for the 'caffe' mode.

The strategy to fix the bug is to correct the calculation of the mean and standard deviation normalization for the 'caffe' mode. Additionally, the implementation of the 'data_format' condition, as well as the rearrangement of the channel positions 'RGB' to 'BGR', should also be checked and corrected if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        x = x[..., ::-1]

    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    x -= mean
    return x
```

This corrected version ensures that the mean and standard deviation normalization is correctly applied for all modes and data formats, and the channel rearrangement is also handled properly.
