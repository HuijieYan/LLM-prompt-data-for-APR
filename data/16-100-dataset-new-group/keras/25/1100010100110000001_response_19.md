The error message indicates that there is a ufunc type error when trying to subtract a float from an integer. This is likely due to the fact that the input `xint` is of type 'int32', and the operation in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is performed in a way that leads to this type error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input `xint` is converted to a float before performing any division or subtraction.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # convert to float
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # convert to float
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # convert to float
        x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # convert to float
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

With these changes, the corrected function will convert the input to float when necessary, thereby avoiding type errors in the calculations. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
