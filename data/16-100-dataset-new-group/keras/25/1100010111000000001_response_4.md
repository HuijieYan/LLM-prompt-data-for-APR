The potential errors in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function are:
1. Not handling the case where `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch'
2. Incorrect calculation of the preprocessed Numpy array for the input shape and data format.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', and as a result, it does not preprocess the input correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch' and also calculate the preprocessed Numpy array correctly for the given input shape and data format.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array. Either 'channels_last' or 'channels_first'.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid mode. Mode must be one of 'tf' or 'torch'.")

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x = x.transpose(0, 3, 1, 2)
    else:
        x = x[..., ::-1]

    # Zero-center by mean pixel for the given data format
    for i in range(3):
        x[..., i] -= mean[i]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., i] /= std[i]

    return x
```

This corrected version handles the case when `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch' by raising a `ValueError`. It also correctly calculates the preprocessed Numpy array for the input shape and data format.
