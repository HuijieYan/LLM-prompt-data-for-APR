After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the runtime input/output values, a potential error location is identified in the conditional part where the mode is checked. The bug occurs when the input data format is 'channels_first' and the mode is other than 'tf' or 'torch'.

The cause of the bug is that when the data format is 'channels_first' and the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function does not perform the correct preprocessing steps on the input array, leading to incorrect output values.

To fix the bug, we need to add the preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' mode when the data format is 'channels_first' in the conditional block where the data format is checked. This includes converting RGB to BGR and zero-centering each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        
        # subtract mean and divide by std
        x = (x - mean) / std
        
    else:  # for 'caffe' mode
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        # Zero-center by mean pixel
        x -= mean
    
    return x
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by adding the necessary preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' mode when the data format is 'channels_first'. Now, the function will correctly perform the required preprocessing based on the input parameters.
