The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is related to the incorrect subtraction of an array element from a numpy array while handling the `torch` mode, which is not compatible with the specified data type. The bug is triggered in the `else` condition block when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the `data_format` is 'channels_last'. The error occurs because it tries to subtract a mean value from a numpy array, resulting in a type mismatch error.

To fix this bug, the correct strategy would be to handle the data type appropriately based on the selected conversion mode. Specifically, when `mode` is 'torch', ensure that the numpy array `x` is converted to a floating-point data type before normalization. This can be achieved using the `astype` method of the numpy array.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float to perform normalization
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

With this corrected version, the bug related to the type mismatch when subtracting mean values from the `x` array should be resolved, and the test case should pass without errors.
