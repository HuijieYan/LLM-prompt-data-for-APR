The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function seems to be related to the conditional blocks for the `mode` parameter, where the `tf` and `torch` modes modify the input array `x` differently than other modes. Additionally, there are separate blocks for handling `data_format` which might not be functioning as intended.

The cause of the bug may be that the conditional logic is not properly handling the different modes and data formats, leading to incorrect preprocessing of the input array `x`.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to carefully review the conditional blocks to ensure that the preprocessing for each mode and data format is applied correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, :, :]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if mode != 'tf':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    return x
```

In the corrected version:
- We have changed the second `if-else` block to `elif-else` to ensure that `tf` and `torch` modes are handled separately.
- The conditional checks for `data_format` have been adjusted to work in conjunction with the `mode` parameter.
- The last part of the function applies the zero-centering and normalization for all modes other than `tf`.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
