The bug in the function _preprocess_numpy_input is likely due to incompatible data types. In the else block of the function, there are calculations that result in float values being applied to an input array of type int32, which causes a UFuncTypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all calculations are performed with float values regardless of the input type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """
    Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """

    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Ensure x is of type float32
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.0
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.0
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:,::-1,...]  # Swap the order of color channels
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[...,::-1]  # Swap the order of color channels
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

This corrected version should resolve the type compatibility issue, ensuring that all calculations are performed using float values, and should pass the failing test.
