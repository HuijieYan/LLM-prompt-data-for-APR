The bug in the function arises from the improper handling of input array `x` with different data formats and modes - 'caffe', 'tf', or 'torch'. The function does not consistently preprocess the input array based on the specified mode and data format, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the preprocessing of the input array `x` is consistent with the specified mode and data format. This can be achieved by adjusting the calculations and transformations for each mode and data format conditionally.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean

    return x
```

In this corrected version, the preprocessing of the input array takes into account the specified mode and data format, ensuring consistent transformations based on the input conditions. This should resolve the inconsistencies and unexpected results seen in the original buggy function.
