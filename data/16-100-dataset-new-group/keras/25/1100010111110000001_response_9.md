The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is causing the test `test_preprocess_input` to fail with the error message `UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'`. 

The bug seems to stem from the fact that when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function tries to subtract the `mean` values from the input array `x` and encounters a data type casting issue, because the `mean` values are of type `float64` and the input array `x` is of type `int32` as shown in the failing test's error message.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `mean` values are converted to the same data type as the input array `x` before the subtraction operation is performed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x.astype('float32')
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x = x[..., ::-1]
        
    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    mean = np.array(mean, dtype=x.dtype)
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        std = np.array(std, dtype=x.dtype)
        x /= std

    return x
```

In the corrected version, we have added type conversion for the `mean` values to the same data type as the input array `x` and also explicitly converted the `x` array to float before performing any operations. This ensures that the operations are performed with the correct data types and should address the casting error.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
