## Problem Analysis
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `x` variable when the mode is set to 'caffe' and the data format is not 'tf' or 'torch'. This can be seen from the error message, which indicates a type error caused by subtracting mean values from `x` when its dtype is 'int32'.

## Bug Fix Strategy
We need to make sure that when the mode is 'caffe' and the data format is not 'tf' or 'torch', we convert the dtype of `x` to float before processing it. This will prevent the type error that is currently occurring.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
