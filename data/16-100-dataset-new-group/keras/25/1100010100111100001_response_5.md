The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is causing a `numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError` when trying to subtract the `mean` value from the input `x` in the case where `mode != 'tf' and mode != 'torch'`. The error occurs due to a mismatch between the `dtype` of the input `x` and the `dtype` of the `mean` values that the function is trying to subtract.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the input `x` is converted to the appropriate data type before performing any arithmetic operations. This can be achieved by explicitly converting `x` to a floating point data type when it is not in 'tf' mode.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.

        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]

    return x
```

By explicitly converting `x` to `float32` when necessary, we can avoid the error caused by a mismatch in the data types, and the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
