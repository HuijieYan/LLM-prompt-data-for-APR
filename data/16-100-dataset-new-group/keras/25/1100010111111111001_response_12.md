## The buggy function
The `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the data format and processing mode. The bug appears to be in the logic where the `mode` is 'torch'. It fails to correctly handle the input when `mode` is 'torch' and `data_format` is 'channels_last'.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the input array when `mode` is 'torch' and `data_format` is 'channels_last'. The code does not properly handle the dimensions of the input array and leads to a type error when trying to subtract the mean from the input.

### Fix Strategy
The code needs to be modified to correctly handle the dimensions and data format of the input array when `mode` is 'torch' and `data_format` is 'channels_last'. This will involve conditional statements to handle the different dimensions and formats of the input array.

## The corrected function

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0] -= mean[0]
            x[1] -= mean[1]
            x[2] -= mean[2]

            if std is not None:
                x[0] /= std[0]
                x[1] /= std[1]
                x[2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] -= mean[0]
                x[1] -= mean[1]
                x[2] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[0] /= std[0]
                    x[1] /= std[1]
                    x[2] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, :, 0] -= mean[0]
            x[:, :, 1] -= mean[1]
            x[:, :, 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, :, 0] /= std[0]
                x[:, :, 1] /= std[1]
                x[:, :, 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

This corrected function addresses the bug by properly handling the input array based on the `data_format` and `mode`. It also ensures that the dimensions of the input array are correctly considered, and any necessary operations are performed accordingly.
