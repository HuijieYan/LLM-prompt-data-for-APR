To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `mode` is 'caffe' and the `data_format` is 'channels_last'. In this case, the mean values need to be subtracted from the input array `x`, and then the order of the color channels should be reversed from RGB to BGR.

The bug occurs when trying to apply operations to the input array `x` without converting it to a `float` type, which leads to a type mismatch error. To fix this, we can convert the input array `x` to a `float` type before performing the operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
        x = x.astype('float')  # Convert to float type
    if std is not None:
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        x -= mean
    return x
```

This corrected version ensures that the input array `x` is properly handled depending on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters, and it should pass the failing test.
