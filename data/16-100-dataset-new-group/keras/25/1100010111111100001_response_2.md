The issue in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is due to the conversion of the input data type from `int32` to `float32` and the subsequent calculations causing UFuncTypeError, as the calculations between different data types are not directly supported in NumPy.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input data type is `float32` before performing any calculations. We can achieve this by adding a line to convert the input `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function to ensure all subsequent calculations are performed with the same data type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py

# corrected function
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
    x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
    data_format: Data format of the image array.
    mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
        - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
            then will zero-center each color channel with
            respect to the ImageNet dataset,
            without scaling.
        - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
            sample-wise.
        - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
            will normalize each channel with respect to the
            ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
    Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:

            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]

            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]

    return x
```

By explicitly converting the input `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all subsequent calculations use the same data type, effectively resolving the UFuncTypeError issue.
