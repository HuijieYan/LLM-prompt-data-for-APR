The potential error locations within the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function are as follows:
1. Incorrectly manipulating the input array `x` based on the `mode` and `data_format`.
2. Improperly applying the mean and standard deviation values for different data formats and modes.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly preprocessing the input array based on the given mode and data format, leading to shape and value inconsistencies in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to properly adjust the input array `x` based on the `mode` and `data_format` provided in the function, as well as ensure that the mean and standard deviation values are applied correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    import numpy as np
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    return x
```

This corrected version handles the data format and mode, applies the correct preprocessing based on the provided parameters, and should pass the failing test.
