The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it calculates the mean and standard deviation values regardless of the given mode, leading to unwanted calculations and incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should calculate the mean and standard deviation values only when the mode is 'torch'. Additionally, the calculations should always be performed using floating point numbers to avoid unexpected behavior with integer input. We will update the function to address these issues.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert the input to float32
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
            std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
            for i in range(3):
                x[i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                x[i, :, :] /= std[i]
        else:
            mean = [0.485 * 255, 0.456 * 255, 0.406 * 255]
            std = [0.229 * 255, 0.224 * 255, 0.225 * 255]
            for i in range(3):
                x[:, :, i] -= mean[i]
                x[:, :, i] /= std[i]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean

    return x
```

With these changes, the function should produce the correct preprocessed Numpy array for different modes and input formats. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
