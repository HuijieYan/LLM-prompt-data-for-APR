The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is causing the failing test. The bug is related to the incorrect application of mean subtraction and scaling to the input array based on the data format and mode.

To fix the bug, we need to properly apply the mean subtraction and scaling based on the data format and mode while ensuring the correct handling of the input array dimensions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x[..., 0] -= 103.939
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 123.68

    return x
```

The corrected version of the function includes proper application of mean subtraction and scaling based on the data format and mode. Additionally, numpy operations are used for more efficient computation.

With the corrected function, the failing test should pass without raising any errors.
