The potential error locations within the function include:
1. Incorrect calculation for mode 'tf'
2. Incorrect calculation for mode 'torch'
3. Improper handling of data format for channels_first vs. channels_last

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements for 'tf' and 'torch' modes are not implemented correctly, and there are issues with handling the data format.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve:
1. Correctly implementing the calculations for 'tf' and 'torch' modes
2. Handling the data format properly for both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last'

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
        else:
            x[:, :, 0, :] -= 103.939
            x[:, :, 1, :] -= 116.779
            x[:, :, 2, :] -= 123.68
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= 103.939
        x[..., 1] -= 116.779
        x[..., 2] -= 123.68
    
    return x
```

In the corrected version, the calculations for 'tf' and 'torch' modes have been implemented correctly, and the data format is handled properly for both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last'.
