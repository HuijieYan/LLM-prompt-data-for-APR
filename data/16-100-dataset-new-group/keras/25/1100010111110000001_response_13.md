The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that when `mode` is 'torch', the function didn't handle the case where `data_format` is 'channels_last' properly. This is causing a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to subtract a float value from an integer array.

To fix this bug, we need to check the `data_format` before performing the calculations when `mode` is 'torch'. If the data format is 'channels_last', we need to transpose the input array `x` so that the color channel is the first dimension, perform the calculations, and then transpose it back to the original shape.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

        if data_format == 'channels_last':
            x = np.transpose(x, (0, 3, 1, 2))
            mean = np.array(mean).reshape((3, 1, 1))
            std = np.array(std).reshape((3, 1, 1))

        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

        if data_format == 'channels_last':
            x = np.transpose(x, (0, 2, 3, 1))

        return x
    else:
        # ... (existing code for other modes)
```
With this correction, the function should handle the 'torch' mode correctly for both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats, and the failing test should pass without the `UFuncTypeError`.
