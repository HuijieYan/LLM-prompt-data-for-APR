## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `mode` variable is not being handled consistently and may cause unexpected behavior.
2. The calculation for `mode == 'torch'` is missing a return statement. 

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of the `mode` variable. In the case where `mode == 'torch'`, the function does not return the preprocessed Numpy array, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add a return statement for the `mode == 'torch'` case to ensure that the preprocessed Numpy array is correctly returned.
2. Use if-elif-else structure for handling the `mode` variable to ensure that only one mode is processed.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

In the corrected version, the `mode` variable is handled consistently using if-elif-else structure. The `mode == 'torch'` case now includes a return statement to ensure that the preprocessed Numpy array is correctly returned.
