The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` attempts to preprocess an image batch using different modes such as 'tf', 'torch', or others. The error message indicates a problem with the data types when the function tries to subtract the mean from the input in a specific line of code.

The cause of the error is that the function is trying to perform a subtraction operation between two arrays with different data types, specifically between a NumPy array with data type 'int32' (xint) and another array with data type 'float64' (mean). This is not allowed in NumPy, hence the error is raised.

To fix the bug, the function must ensure that the data types of the arrays are compatible before performing any arithmetic operations. This can be achieved by ensuring that the input array is converted to a suitable data type before processing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float before performing the operation
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float before performing the operation
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)  # Ensure the mean is of float type
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)  # Ensure the std is of float type
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float before performing the operation
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)  # Ensure the mean is of float type
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

This corrected function ensures that the input array `x` is converted to a suitable data type (float32) before any arithmetic operations are performed. Additionally, it explicitly defines the mean and std arrays as arrays of float type to ensure compatibility with the input array.
