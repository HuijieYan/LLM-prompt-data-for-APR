The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by incorrect handling of the input array based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters. The bug is more apparent in the cases where the data format is 'channels_first' and the mode is 'caffe'. In these cases, the function modifies the input array incorrectly, resulting in incorrect mean subtraction and channel-wise division by standard deviation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the different modes and data formats, ensuring that the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation are applied appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

By correcting the handling of the Mode and Data Format, the updated function should now pass the failing tests.
