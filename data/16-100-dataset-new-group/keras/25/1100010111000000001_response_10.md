The potential error in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function can be identified in the data format conversion and the mode-specific preprocessing operations.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the different modes ('tf', 'torch', 'caffe') for preprocessing the input array. This leads to incorrect preprocessing and shape manipulations when the function is used in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly preprocesses the input array based on the specified data format and mode.

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format='channels_last', mode='tf'):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x - mean[:, None, None]
            x = x / std[:, None, None]
        else:
            x = x - mean[None, None, :]
            x = x / std[None, None, :]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            x -= mean[:, None, None]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            x -= mean[None, None, :]
    return x
```

The corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function now correctly handles the different modes for preprocessing and also respects the data format. It ensures that the input array is preprocessed according to the specified mode and data format, which should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
