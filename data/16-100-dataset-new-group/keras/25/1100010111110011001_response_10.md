By analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can identify the following issues:
1. The function doesn't handle the case where mode is not 'tf' or 'torch' correctly. It should apply a transformation to the input x based on the provided mode, but it doesn't handle this properly.
2. The function doesn't handle the data_format argument correctly. It should reorder the dimensions of x based on data_format, but it doesn't handle this properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _preprocess_numpy_input function to handle the different modes and data formats correctly.

The corrected code is provided above, which should now satisfy all the test cases and return the expected output.
