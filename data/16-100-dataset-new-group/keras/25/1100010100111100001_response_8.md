The issue in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that for cases where `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the normalization and zero-centering operations are incorrectly performed, leading to a type error when the input is of type int32.

This bug is caused by incorrect indexing and broadcasting of the mean and standard deviation values, leading to a mismatch in types when performing operations. To fix this bug, we need to correctly perform the zero-centering and normalization operations based on the `data_format` and input dimensions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 103.939
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 123.68
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

With this corrected version, the bug related to the type error in the original uncorrected function should be fixed.
