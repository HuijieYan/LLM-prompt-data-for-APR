The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by an incorrect handling of the input parameters and mode-specific operations. When the `mode` is set to 'caffe', the function should perform certain operations on the input array `x` based on the `data_format`. However, due to missing and incorrect conditional checks, the function does not properly handle the 'caffe' mode, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the 'caffe' mode by performing the necessary operations based on the `data_format` and then returning the preprocessed array.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        # Standardize the channels
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    
    return x
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle the 'caffe' mode based on the `data_format` and return the preprocessed array. This correction should make the function pass the failing test cases.
