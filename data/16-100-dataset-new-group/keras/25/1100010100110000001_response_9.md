The error message indicates that there is an issue when subtracting the mean from the input array, resulting in a `UFuncTypeError`. This error occurs when attempting to subtract a float value from an array of type `int32`. This suggests that the input array `x` is of type `int32`, while the mean values are of type `float64`. The code is attempting to perform an operation that cannot be cast between different data types.

To fix this bug, we can ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a float type before performing the subtraction operation. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    # Convert input array to a floating point type
    x = x.astype('float32')

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x -= mean  # Subtract mean from the array
        if std is not None:
            x /= std  # Divide by standard deviation
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
        x -= mean  # Subtract mean from the array
        if std is not None:
            x /= std  # Divide by standard deviation

    return x
```

By converting the input array to a floating point type at the beginning of the function, we can ensure that the subsequent arithmetic operations will be performed as expected without type-casting issues.
