Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The bug seems to be in the `else` block where `x` is assigned a new value based on the `data_format`.
- The error message indicates that a ufunc 'subtract' output cannot be cast from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with the casting rule 'same_kind'.
- This suggests that the calculation to subtract the mean from the input `x` is producing float values, which cannot be stored in an array of type int32.

Cause of the bug:
When the function encounters the `else` block, it updates the input `x` based on the `data_format` provided. This update includes subtracting values from `x` that could produce floating-point numbers, even if the input was originally of type int32. This leads to a mismatch in data type when subtracting the mean from the input `x`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the code should ensure that the data type of the input `x` is preserved during the mean subtraction operation. One approach could be to convert `x` to a floating-point type before performing the subtraction, in order to avoid the mismatch in data types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
