The bug in the provided function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is that it does not correctly handle the 'caffe' mode when the data_format is 'channels_last'. The function only checks for the 'tf' and 'torch' modes, and the 'caffe' mode for 'channels_first', but does not cover the 'caffe' mode for 'channels_last'.

Here's an explanation of how the bug occurs in each case:
1. The first test case provides input in the 'channels_last' format and the 'caffe' mode, but the function fails to correctly preprocess the input according to the 'caffe' mode.
2. The second test case also provides input in the 'channels_last' format and the 'caffe' mode, resulting in incorrect preprocessing.
3. The third and fourth test cases provide input in the 'channels_first' format and the 'caffe' mode. The function handles the 'caffe' mode correctly in this case.
4. The fifth and sixth test cases provide input in the 'channels_last' format, and the function fails to correctly preprocess the input according to the 'caffe' mode.
5. The seventh and eighth test cases provide input in the 'channels_first' format and the 'caffe' mode, and the function fails to correctly preprocess the input according to the 'caffe' mode.

To fix the bug, we need to extend the function to properly handle the 'caffe' mode for both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:  # 'channels_last'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    if std is not None:  # Normalize
        x -= mean
        x = x / std
    else:  # Zero-center
        x -= mean
    return x
```

The corrected version of the function should handle the 'caffe' mode for both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats, ensuring that the input arrays are preprocessed correctly according to the specified mode and data format.
