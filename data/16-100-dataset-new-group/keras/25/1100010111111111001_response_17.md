To fix the bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, we need to address the issue of integer division causing the `UFuncTypeError` when the input array `x` is of type `int32`. Specifically, the bug is occurring when the function tries to perform operations on `x` using floating point values, creating the mismatch in data types.

To fix this bug, we can explicitly convert the input `x` to a float type before performing any divisions or arithmetic operations on it. This conversion will ensure that the arithmetic operations are consistent across different input data types, preventing the `UFuncTypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.
    (rest of the docstring remains unchanged)
    """
    x = np.array(x, dtype='float32')  # Convert x to float32 type
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float32')
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float32')
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')
        std = None

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By explicitly converting the input `x` to `float32` type at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all subsequent arithmetic operations are consistent and avoid the `UFuncTypeError` that was occurring with integer data types. This correction should resolve the issue observed in the failing test cases, and the corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
