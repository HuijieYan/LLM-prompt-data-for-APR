The bug in the given function is that it does not properly handle the 'torch' mode, and it has inconsistent handling of different axes for the 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats.

To fix the bug, we can introduce a separate handling for the 'torch' mode and adjust the mean and std normalization according to the data format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

With this corrected function, the 'torch' mode handling has been properly introduced, and the mean and std normalization is adjusted based on the data format. This should ensure that the function returns the expected output values and types for all the given cases.
