The cause of the bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that, when branch `mode == 'square'`, the function does not correctly handle the case where the input array `x` has dtype `int32`. The implementation is trying to perform element-wise operations on the input array `x` using floating point numbers, which results in a UFuncTypeError when trying to subtract a float64 dtype from an int32 dtype.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation to handle the case where the input array `x` has dtype `int32`. We can achieve this by converting the input array `x` to float64 before performing any arithmetic operations on it, ensuring that the resulting array maintains a consistent data type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function.

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:

        if x.ndim == 3:

```

In the corrected version, we added the `x = x.astype('float64')` statements for the `'tf'` and `'torch'` modes to convert the input array to float64 before performing any calculations, which resolves the UFuncTypeError.

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass.
