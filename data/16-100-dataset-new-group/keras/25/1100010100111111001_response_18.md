### Code Analysis
The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` when attempting to subtract `mean[0]` from `x[..., 0]`. This is likely due to a type mismatch between the float `mean[0]` and the integer array `x[..., 0]`. The function seems to incorrectly handle the data type conversion and array operations for different modes.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not properly handling the data type conversion and array operations for different modes. In this case, the function fails to properly handle the type conversion when `mode='caffe'` and causes the `UFuncTypeError`.

### Bug Fix
We need to ensure proper type conversion and array operations for different modes to fix the bug.

### Updated Function
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
