The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by the use of different data types for input arrays when performing arithmetic operations. Specifically, the function divides an input array of type `int32` by `float` values, and thus, the output array is expected to be of type `float32`. However, in some cases, the function mistakenly tries to subtract or divide array elements of type `int32` from arrays of type `float64`, leading to a `UFuncTypeError` error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed consistently using arrays of the same type. In particular, we should ensure that the data type of the input array `x` is preserved throughout the computations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5
        x = x - 1.0
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
        else:
            x[:, :, 0, :] -= 103.939
            x[:, :, 1, :] -= 116.779
            x[:, :, 2, :] -= 123.68
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= 103.939
        x[..., 1] -= 116.779
        x[..., 2] -= 123.68
    
    return x
```

With this corrected version, the function should consistently maintain the data type of the input array `x` throughout the preprocessing steps, eliminating the `UFuncTypeError` issue.
