The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it modifies the input `x` in place, which causes the function to fail when it tries to subtract the `mean` from `x` because they have different data types. To fix this, we need to create a new local variable `processed_x` and perform operations on this variable instead of directly modifying `x`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        processed_x = x / 127.5 - 1.
        return processed_x

    if mode == 'torch':
        processed_x = x / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        processed_x = x.copy()  # Create a copy of x to avoid modifying the input
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if processed_x.ndim == 3:
                processed_x = processed_x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                processed_x = processed_x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            processed_x = processed_x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        processed_x -= np.array(mean).reshape(1, -1, 1, 1)
        if std is not None:
            processed_x /= np.array(std).reshape(1, -1, 1, 1)
    else:
        processed_x -= np.array(mean)
        if std is not None:
            processed_x /= np.array(std)

    return processed_x
```
In the corrected version, we create a new variable `processed_x` to perform operations and modifications, and we return this variable at the end of the function. This ensures that the input `x` remains unchanged and prevents in-place modifications that could lead to type inconsistencies.
