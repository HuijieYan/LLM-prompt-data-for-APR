The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it does not properly handle the mode 'caffe' when `data_format` is 'channels_first'.

The cause of the bug is that when `mode` is 'caffe' and `data_format` is 'channels_first', the function should convert the images from RGB to BGR and then zero-center and normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset. However, the current implementation does not handle this case properly.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to add a conditional block for the case where `mode` is 'caffe' and `data_format` is 'channels_first', and implement the necessary operations to convert the images from RGB to BGR, zero-center, and normalize each channel.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # convert the images from RGB to BGR
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]  # ImageNet mean for BGR
            std = None
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]  # ImageNet mean for BGR
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:  # normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset
        x /= std

    return x
```

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test cases should now pass. The function properly handles the case where `mode` is 'caffe' and `data_format` is 'channels_first', converting the images from RGB to BGR and applying zero-centering and normalization.
