The bug is caused by the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is called when creating a date range with a custom business hour frequency. This method adjusts the datetime objects to align with the custom business hour rules, but it does not correctly handle the case when the resulting datetime array has a different length than the original one.

The error message "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH" indicates that the date range function is trying to validate the frequency of the resulting datetime array, but the frequency is not correctly inferred.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `apply` method correctly adjusts the datetime objects to align with the custom business hour rules and that the resulting datetime array has the correct length.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if other < self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)):
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = apply_index_wraps(self._prev_opening_time, self, other)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we removed the code that adjusts the datetime array by subtracting or adding days, as it is not needed and can cause incorrect results. We also added a check for the case when the datetime object is at the boundary of a business day, in which case we adjust it to the next opening time.

With this corrected version, the `apply` method should correctly adjust the datetime objects to align with the custom business hour rules and return a datetime array with the correct length.
