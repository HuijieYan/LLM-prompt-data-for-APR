I've analyzed the buggy function and identified the potential error locations. Here's the breakdown:

1. Error location: `other = self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))` in the `else` block of the `if n < 0` condition.
2. Cause of the bug: The issue is that `self._next_opening_time` is called with a negative offset, which can cause it to return a date that is not on the business day. This can lead to incorrect results.

Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Avoid calling `self._next_opening_time` with a negative offset. Instead, move the adjustment to the next business day or the previous business day before calling this function.
2. Correct the implementation of the `else` block to properly handle the case where `n < 0`.

Corrected version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            #...
            if n < 0:
                # Move to the previous business day
                other = self.next_bday - timedelta(days=1)
                # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            #...
```
I've removed the negative offset adjustment from the `else` block and instead moved it to the previous business day. This should fix the bug.

Note that this is a simplified fix, and you may need to further refine it depending on the specific requirements of the functionality.
