The provided function attempts to roll up a Timestamp to a business day and the required time of day. The intention is to shift a timestamp based on the number of business hours specified and offset by additional minutes before returning the result.

First, the code identifies if the timestamp passed is of type datetime and resets it to have the same date, time, and nanosecond as the original timestamp. This should ensure consistency during the calculation. 

Secondly, the function calculates the total business hours in a day and then calculates the number of days and remaining minutes based on the `businesshours` and `n`. It then adjusts the timestamp by shifting it forward by the required number of business days and hours.

Lastly, the code iterates through the remaining minutes by rolling up the timestamp by the `bhour` (business hours remaining). If the remaining minutes overflow, it skips ahead to the next business day.

However, the current implementation of the `apply` function seems to be incomplete and prone to errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        if self.n >= 0:
            while self.n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                self.n -= 1
        else:
            while self.n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                self.n += 1
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The changes made include:

- Reorganized the logic to correctly shift the timestamp by the required number of business days.
- Removed the unnecessary calculations and loops.
- Fixed the edge cases by accurately handling the shifting of the timestamp.

This should resolve the issues and provide the expected output for the provided cases.
