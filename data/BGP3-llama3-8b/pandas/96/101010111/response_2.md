I've analyzed the buggy function and identified the potential errors. After examining the expected values and types of variables, I determined that the main issues are with the logic of the time calculations and the handling of holiday dates.

To correct the bug, I suggest the following strategy:

1.  Improve Time Calculations:
    *   Enhance the logic for calculating the remaining time after adjusting for business hours and holidays.
    *   Use the `next_bday` function to correctly adjust the datetime objects for business days.
2.  Correct Holiday Date Handling:
    *   Ensure that the function correctly skips dates that are holidays, taking into account the business hours and day boundaries.
    *   Implement a more robust approach to handle holiday dates, considering the `holidays` parameter and the business hours.

By following these steps, we can create a corrected version of the buggy function that meets the expected cases and resolves the GitHub issue.

Here's a sample corrected function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Ensure the datetime object is in the correct business hour format
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd!= 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._prev_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain > bhour:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                break

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected function, the date_range functionality should work as expected, handling holiday dates and business hours accurately, and producing the correct output for periods calculations.
