The bug is in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This function is designed to handle the business hour offset and adjust the date accordingly. 

In particular, the issue arises when the BusinessDay calculated by the method `BusinessDay(n=3)` includes days that lie outside of the frequency range. In this case, the `_next_opening_time` method is not correctly handling the datetime.

For instance, if `self.n` is greater than 0, it calculates `_next_opening_time` by adding `BusinessDay` to the current date. This could lead to a situation where `_next_opening_time` becomes a date that is beyond the frequency's end.

Also, in the case where `n` is less than 0, it subtracts `BusinessDay` from the current date, which also results in a date beyond the frequency's start.

This causes the `apply` function to fail when computing the `_next_opening_time` and adjusting the date according to the frequency.

To fix this bug, we can add a check in the `apply` function to ensure that `_next_opening_time` stays within the frequency's range. Here is the corrected code:

```
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
   ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
       ...
        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while other < self.end[-1]:
                # rest of your code
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)  
        return other
```

With this modification, the `apply` function will correctly adjust the date based on the frequency, ensuring it always stays within the specified range.
