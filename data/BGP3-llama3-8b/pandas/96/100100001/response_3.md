After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the test code, I identified the potential error locations as follows:

1. The function `apply` expects `other` to be a `datetime` object, but in the failing test, `other` is a `Timestamp` object. This seems to be the root cause of the bug.
2. The function `apply` uses `datetime` methods such as `time()` and `replace` which are not available for `Timestamp` objects. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
3. The function `apply` also uses `getattr` to access the `nanosecond` attribute of `other`, which is not present in `Timestamp` objects.

To fix the bug, I suggest the following strategy:

1. Modify the function `apply` to handle `Timestamp` objects correctly.
2. Update the function `apply` to use methods that are available for `Timestamp` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, (datetime, date)):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)  # remove timezone info
        else:
            other = datetime.combine(other, datetime.min.time())  # combine with time

        #... (rest of the function remains the same)
```
I added a check to handle both `datetime` and `date` objects. For `datetime` objects, I use the `replace` method to remove the timezone information. For `date` objects, I combine them with a time object to create a `datetime` object.

With this correction, the function `apply` should now correctly handle `Timestamp` objects and pass the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
