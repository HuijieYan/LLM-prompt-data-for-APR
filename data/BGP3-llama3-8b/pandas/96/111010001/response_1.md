Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        if bd!= 0:
            other = self._adjust_by_business_days(other, bd)
        if r!= 0:
            other = self._adjust_by_business_hours(other, r)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Explanation of the fix:

The bug in the function was that when the `n` value was negative, it was not correctly adjusting for the previous business day. This was because the code was using `self._next_opening_time` to adjust for the previous business day, but `self._next_opening_time` assumes that the current datetime is not on a businessday. So, when `n` was negative and the current datetime was not on a business day, the code was not correctly adjusting for the previous business day.

I have added a new method `_adjust_by_business_days` to correctly adjust for the previous business day. I also added a new method `_adjust_by_business_hours` to correctly adjust for the remaining business hours.
