After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class and test code, I have identified a potential error location. The bug is likely due to the incorrect calculation of business hours and the subsequent application of the business hour to the datetime object.

The cause of the bug is that the `self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)` function returns the business hours in seconds, but the `apply` function assumes that it returns the business hours in minutes. This mismatch leads to an incorrect calculation of the business hours, resulting in a faulty application of the business hour to the datetime object.

Here is a suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

1.  Correct the calculation of business hours in the `self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)` function to return the business hours in minutes. This will ensure that the `apply` function correctly calculates the business hours.

2.  Review the logic in the `apply` function to ensure that it correctly handles the `n` variable, which represents the number of business hours to adjust. This adjustment should be done based on the total business hours and not the current time.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
       ...
        n = self.n
    
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
           ...
        else:
           ...
    
        # get total business hours in minutes
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_min(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
    
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
    
       ...
```

Note that this is just one possible fix, and there may be additional issues later in the function that will need to be addressed based on further analysis.

I hope this helps!
