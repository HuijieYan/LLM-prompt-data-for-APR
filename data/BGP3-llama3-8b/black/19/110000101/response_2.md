The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines` which is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

From the test cases, it seems that the function should return a tuple of two integers, each representing the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the line. The function seems to be expected to add or remove empty lines based on certain conditions.

The conditions are:

* If the current line's depth is 0, max_allowed should be set to 2.
* If the current line's depth is not 0, max_allowed should be set to 1.
* If the current line is a decorator, an import, or a class definition, no empty lines are needed before the line.
* If the current line is a function definition or a variable definition, one empty line is needed before the line.
* If the current line is a flow control statement, one empty line is needed after the line.

Based on these conditions, I will provide the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_def = current_line.is_def
    is_class = current_line.is_class
    is_flow_control = current_line.is_flow_control

    if is_decorator or is_class or is_flow_control:
        after = 0
    elif is_def:
        after = 1
    else:
        after = 2

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        after = 0

    newlines = after
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    return before, newlines
```

This corrected function should satisfy all the test cases.
