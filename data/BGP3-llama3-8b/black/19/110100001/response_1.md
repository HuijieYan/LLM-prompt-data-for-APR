Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = before * "\n"
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
        
        self.previous_line = current_line
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return before, newlines
```

The causes of the bugs were:

- In the original code, `first_leaf.prefix = ""` was used, which would not keep track of the newlines effectively.
- The `self.previous_line` was not updated correctly.
- The function was not considering the case where the previous line was a decorator correctly.

To fix the bugs, I changed `first_leaf.prefix = ""` to `first_leaf.prefix = before * "\n"` so that the newlines are Kept track of effectively.
I added `self.previous_line = current_line` to update the `self.previous_line` correctly.
I changed the return statement to `return before, newlines` to correctly return the number of newlines before and after the current line.
I removed the last `if` condition and the modification of `self.previous_defs` as they were not correctly checking for the previous line.
