Based on the provided information, I can identify the potential error locations within the buggy function.

The function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be responsible for determining the number of newlines to add before and after a code block. However, there are several issues with the function:

1. The function is not considering the indentation of the code block correctly. It's assuming that the indentation is always 4 spaces, which might not be the case.
2. The function is not handling the case correctly when the code block is a decorator function.
3. The function is not considering the line continuation correctly.

The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` suggests that the function is not handling the case correctly when there is a decorator function with a comment.

Based on the provided cases, I can see that the function is returning incorrect values for the number of newlines to add before and after the code block.

To fix the bug, I suggest the following:

1. Refactor the function to correctly calculate the indentation level based on the line numbers and indentation characters.
2. Add a special case to handle decorator functions and ignore the comments within them.
3. Improve the function to correctly handle line continuations and ignore the newline characters.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    #...
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        # Ignore comments within decorator functions
        comments = [leaf for leaf in current_line.leaves if leaf.token_type == Token.TYPE_COMMENT]
        for comment in comments:
            current_line.leaves.remove(comment)
    #...
```
In this corrected version, I added a special case to handle decorator functions and ignored the comments within them. This should fix the bug and make the function more robust.
