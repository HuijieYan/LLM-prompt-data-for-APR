I have corrected the buggy function. The corrected function is shown below.

```Python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    # The bugfix: Use 'self.previous_line' when it is not None
    if self.previous_line:
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    else:
        newlines = 0

    before = 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth!= self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return (before or 1), newlines
```

Here are the key changes made:

1.  In the function, I have removed the bug by using `self.previous_line` when it is not None.
2.  Added a check for `self.previous_line` before accessing its attributes.
3.  Changed the return value of the function in the case where `self.previous_line` is not None.

With these changes, the function should now behave correctly for all the expected cases.
