I have analyzed the buggy function and identified the potential errors. After examining the expected input/output values and the bug class doc, I have formulated a strategy to fix the bug. 

The bug is due to incorrect handling of variable assignments in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. Specifically, the "_maybe_empty_lines" function has inconsistent logic for handling decorator lines and definition lines. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```Python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return before, 0
    if current_line.is_def:
        return before, 1
    if current_line.is_class:
        return before, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control or current_line.is_yield or current_line.is_import:
        return before, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_def and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before + 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

This corrected function correctly handles decorator lines, definition lines, and other types of lines in the input data. It returns the expected number of blank lines to insert before/after the current line.
