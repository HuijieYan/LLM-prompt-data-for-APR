**Analysis**

The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. Its purpose is to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function takes into account various conditions such as the current line's depth, whether it's a decorator, a definition, a class, or a flow control statement, and whether the previous line is an import or a yield statement.

**Error Locations**

The bug is in the line `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:`. This line is trying to access the `is_decorator` attribute of the previous line, but it's not guaranteed that the previous line is a `Line` object that has this attribute.

**Cause of the Bug**

The bug is caused by a mismatch between the type of `self.previous_line` and the type of object that is expected to have the `is_decorator` attribute. This mismatch can occur when the test case is processing a file that contains a comment in a decorator, which causes the `self.previous_line` to be a `str` object (the comment) instead of a `Line` object.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.previous_line` is a `Line` object before trying to access its `is_decorator` attribute. We can do this by adding a check to see if `self.previous_line` is a `Line` object before accessing its attributes.

**Corrected Version**

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
   ...
    if self.previous_line and isinstance(self.previous_line, Line) and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0
   ...
```
In this corrected version, we added `isinstance(self.previous_line, Line)` to ensure that `self.previous_line` is a `Line` object before trying to access its `is_decorator` attribute.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
