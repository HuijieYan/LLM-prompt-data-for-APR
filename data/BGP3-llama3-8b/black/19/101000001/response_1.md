After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, we can identify potential error locations within the buggy function. The bug is occurring due to the usage of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in a way that is not consistent with the function's implementation.

The bug is in the line `result = self.get_blank_lines(resulti, resultj)` because there are no assignments for `resulti` and `resultj`. This code is trying to get the number of blank lines from the previous function call, but it is not following the correct logic.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth!= self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the bug is fixed by removing the incorrect calls to `self.get_blank_lines(resulti, resultj)`. Additionally, the logic inside the function is made consistent with the implementation.
