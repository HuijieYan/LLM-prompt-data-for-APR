Based on the provided test case and error message, it appears that the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the insertion of newlines when formatting a Python code.

The issue seems to be with the logic in the function, specifically when handling decorators, def statements, and imports. The function is not correctly determining when to insert newlines, which is causing the spacing in the output code to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle these cases. Here's a suggested correction:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_def:
            return 1, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This corrected function should handle the cases correctly and produce the expected output. Note that this is just a suggested correction and may need further refinement depending on the specific requirements of the function.
