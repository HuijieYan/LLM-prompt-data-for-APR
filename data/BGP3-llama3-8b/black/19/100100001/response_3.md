The buggy function provided is `_maybe_empty_lines` which is supposed to handle the insertion of empty lines in a python source code. This function is used in the Black library which is a code formatter for Python.

The function seems to be comparing the current line with the previous lines and the previous definition levels to decide whether to insert empty lines or not. The function also seems to handle cases where a decorator, class or function is defined.

The test provided is `test_comment_in_decorator` which tests whether Black correctly handles comments in decorators.

The bug in the function is that it does not handle the case where a decorator has a decorator. This can be seen in the last two conditionals where it returns 0,0. This means that no new lines are inserted between a decorator and its inner decorator.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```Python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    #...

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Check if the previous line is also a decorator
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines between decorators, even if one is a nested decorator
        else:
            return newlines, 0

    #...
```

In this corrected function, if the current line is a decorator and the previous line is also a decorator, then no new lines are inserted between them, even if one of them is a nested decorator.
