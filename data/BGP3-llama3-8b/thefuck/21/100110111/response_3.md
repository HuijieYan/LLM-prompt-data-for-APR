Based on the provided information, I will identify the potential error location within the buggy function, explain the cause of the bug, suggest a strategy for fixing the bug, and provide the corrected version.

Potential error location:
```
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This function is supposed to check if the `git` command is a `stash` command and if its output contains the string `'usage:'`. The error occurs when `command.script.split()[1]` is executed, which throws an `IndexError` because the list doesn't have enough elements to access the second element.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `command.script` is simply `'git'`, which means splitting it by spaces (`' '`) will result in a list with one element, `'git'`. Therefore, when trying to access the second element (`command.script.split()[1]`), it throws an `IndexError` because there is no second element.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition to check if the command is `git stash` and if its output contains the string `'usage:'`.

Corrected function:
```
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and command.script.split()[1:] == ['stash'] and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
This corrected function first checks if the command script is equal to `'git'`, then it checks if the remaining elements after splitting (`command.script.split()[1:]`) are equal to `['stash']`. Finally, it checks if the command's standard error contains the string `'usage:'`.
