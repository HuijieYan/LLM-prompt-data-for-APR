The bug in this code is that it's trying to access the second element of the `command.script` list using `command.script.split()[1]`, but if the `command.script` is only one element (like 'git' in this case), this will raise an `IndexError` because there is no second element.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_list = command.script.split()
    return len(script_list) > 1 and script_list[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

The change is in the first line where `command.script.split()[1]` is replaced with `script_list[1]`. `script_list` is calculated by calling `command.script.split()` which splits the `command.script` string into a list using spaces as the delimiter. This value is then used to access the second element of the list (`script_list[1]`), ensuring that the `IndexError` is not raised.
