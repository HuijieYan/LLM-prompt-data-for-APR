The bug in the function is because the command's script does not contain the `stash` command, so trying to access the second element of the split script (`command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`) will result in an `IndexError`. 

Instead, we need to check if 'stash' is anywhere in the command's script. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script.split()
```

This function will return `True` if the string 'stash' is found anywhere in the command's script. 

This corrected function should satisfy all the expected cases.
