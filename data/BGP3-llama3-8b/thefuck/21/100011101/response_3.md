**Bug Analysis**

The bug is an `IndexError: list index out of range` in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This error occurs when the list returned by `command.script.split()` has fewer than two elements, so `command.script.split()[1]` returns an out-of-range index.

**Error Cause**

The error is caused by the assumption that the `command.script` always contains at least two elements separated by a space (`split()` returns a list of substrings). However, in this case, the `command.script` is simply `'git'`, so `split()` returns a list with only one element (`['git']`).

**Fix Strategy**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `split()` method is called only when the `command.script` contains at least two elements. We can do this by checking the length of the resulting list before accessing its elements.

**Corrected Function**

Here is the corrected function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
**Changes**

1. `script_parts` is assigned the result of `command.script.split()`.
2. We check the length of `script_parts` using `len(script_parts) > 1`. If it's less than 2, we return `False` immediately.
3. We access the second element of `script_parts` using `script_parts[1]`, which is safe since we've checked the length is > 1.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
