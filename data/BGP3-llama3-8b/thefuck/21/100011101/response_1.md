Let's go through the steps to fix the bug.

**Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the error message**

The error message is `IndexError: list index out of range`. This error occurs when we try to access an element in a list that does not exist. In the buggy function, this happens when the `command.script.split()[1]` expression is evaluated.

**Identify potential error locations within the buggy function**

The error is likely due to the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`.

**Explain the cause of the bug**

The cause of the bug is that the `command.script` contains the usage message of the `git stash` command, which includes multiple lines of text. When we split this text by spaces, the resulting list might not have enough elements to access the second element (index 1). This is because the first element is `'git'`, and the rest of the elements are part of the usage message.

**Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we are only accessing elements of the `command.script` that actually exist. We can do this by checking if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

**Code the corrected version**

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into a list of parts using the `split()` method. Then, we check if the list has at least two elements using the `len()` function. If it does, we check if the second element is `'stash'` using the `[1]` indexing. Finally, we return a boolean value based on whether the command.stderr contains the string `'usage:'`.

**Test the corrected version**

I hope this corrected version passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output values.
