**Analysis and Bug Identification**

The buggy function is a matcher that checks if a Git command's stderr output contains a 'usage:' message. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` which suggests that the `script` attribute of the `command` object is likely to be an empty string or not a list.

**Potential Error Locations**

1. The `script` attribute of the `command` object is not a list.
2. The `split()[1]` indexing operation is incorrect.

**Cause of the Bug**

The bug is caused by the incorrect assumption that the `script` attribute of the `command` object is a list. Since it's not a list, the `split()` method returns an empty list, and the indexing operation `split()[1]` raises an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

1. Verify that the `script` attribute is a list.
2. Use the `command.script.split()` method to split the script into a list of words.
3. Check if the first element of the split list matches 'stash'.

**Corrected Function**

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return script_words and script_words[0].lower() == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

**Changes**

1. Added a check `script_words and` to ensure that the `script` attribute is not an empty list.
2. Used `script_words[0].lower() == 'stash'` to match the first word of the script with 'stash' (case-insensitive).
3. Left the rest of the matcher unchanged.

**Expected Output**

For the given test case, the corrected function should return `False` since the script does not start with 'stash' and the stderr output contains a 'usage:' message.
