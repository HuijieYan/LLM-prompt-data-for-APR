Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function, here's the analysis:

1. The buggy function checks if the `git` command's script is split into a list with the first element being 'stash' and if the error output contains 'usage:'.
2. However, if the user runs `git` without any subcommands (e.g., `git` only), the `script` property in the `command` object will be an empty string, which will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split list using `command.script.split()[1]`.
3. The GitHub issue is likely caused by this behavior, as the `thefuck` rule is expecting a `git` command with a subcommand, but isn't prepared to handle the case where only `git` is run.

To fix this, we need to modify the buggy function to check if the `script` property is not empty before trying to split the script and access its elements.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr and command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```
The corrected function first checks if `command.script` is not empty using the `and` operator. If it's not empty, it then checks the remaining conditions:
* `usage:' in command.stderr`: This condition remains the same.
* `command.script.split()[0] == 'git'`: This condition ensures that the first element of the split script is indeed 'git', which is the overall command being run.
* `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`: This condition remains the same.

With this corrected code, the `thefuck` rule should now correctly identify and fix `git stash` commands, even when the user runs `git` only.
