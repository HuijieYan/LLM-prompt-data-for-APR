Based on the provided code and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `match` function is that it assumes the command script will always have at least two elements after splitting the script by spaces. However, when the script is simply `git`, it only has one element, causing an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we can add a simple check to ensure that the script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If the script has fewer elements, we can return `False` to indicate that the command does not match the rule.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    if len(parts) >= 2 and parts[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
In this corrected version, we first split the command script into parts using the `split` method. If the length of the parts list is 2 or more, we check if the second part matches `'stash'`. If it does, we check if the stderr output contains the string `'usage:'`. If both conditions are met, we return `True` to indicate that the command matches the rule. If the conditions are not met, we return `False`.

With this corrected function, the `git_fix_stash` rule should no longer fail when the command is simply `git`.
