Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Following these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the expected input/output values.
2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the expected input/output variable values.
4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version. The corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```




## Expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases.

### Expected case 1
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
command.script, expected value: `'git'`, type: `str`

command, expected value: `Command(script=git, stdout=, stderr=
usage: git stash list [<options>]
   or: git stash show [<stash>]
   or: git stash drop [-q`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, expected value: `'\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q`, type: `str`

#### Expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
splited_script, expected value: `['git']`, type: `list`
