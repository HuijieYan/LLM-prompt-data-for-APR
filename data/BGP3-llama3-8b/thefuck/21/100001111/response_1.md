After analyzing the buggy function and the runtime input/output values, the expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, I identified the potential error location within the buggy function.

The bug is caused by the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`.

In the case where the input command is simply `'git'`, `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` because the list has only one element, which is `'git'`. The index `1` is out of range.

The corrected strategy is to check if the list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    if len(script) >= 2 and script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```
In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into a list using the `split()` method. We then check if the length of the list is greater than or equal to 2 using the `len()` function and the `>=` operator. If the length is 2 or more, we check if the second element of the list is equal to `'stash'` and if the `command.stderr` contains the string `'usage:'`. If all conditions are met, we return `True`. If not, we return `False`.

With this correction, the function should now work correctly and pass the failing tests.
