Based on the provided information, I will analyze the buggy function, identify the potential error locations, and suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.

The buggy function is:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The error is occurring when the script is just 'git' and not followed by any arguments.

The potential error location is in the line where we're trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list. If the list has less than two elements, this will cause an `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the script is just 'git' and not followed by any arguments.

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (script_parts and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In this corrected version, we check if the `script_parts` list has at least one element before trying to access the second element. If it has at least one element, we proceed with the original logic. This should handle the case where the script is just 'git' and not followed by any arguments.
