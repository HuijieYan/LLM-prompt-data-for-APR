**Analyzing the buggy function:**

The function `match` takes a `command` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the command matches the rule. The rule is based on the command script and its stderr output.

**Error locations:**

1. The `split()` function on `command.script` assumes that the script is a string that can be split into a list using whitespace as a delimiter. However, the provided runtime values and types suggest that `command.script` is actually a string containing the word `'git'`, not a list of arguments.
2. The `split()[1]` attempt assumes that the list obtained from `split()` has at least two elements, but the provided runtime values indicate that `command.script` is just a single string `'git'`, so there is no index 1 to access.

**Cause of the bug:**

The bug is caused by incorrect assumptions about the type and contents of `command.script`. The function is trying to access the second element of a list obtained from `split()`, but the list has only one element. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the non-existent element at index 1.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

1. Correctly split the command script into individual arguments.
2. Verify that the script is not just a single word like `'git'`.
3. Update the condition to check if the script contains the word `'stash'` instead of relying on an invalid list access.

**Corrected function:**

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[0] == 'git' and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

**Explanation:**

1. We split the command script into individual arguments using `split()`.
2. We check if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1 to ensure that the script is not just a single word like `'git'`.
3. We then check if the first element of the list is `'git'` and the second element is `'stash'`.
4. If both conditions are true, we check if the stderr output contains the word `'usage:'`.
5. If any of these conditions are false, we return `False`, indicating that the command does not match the rule.
