Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```
# The relative path of the corrected buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git' in command.script.split()[0]  # Check if the script is a git command
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)  # Check if the error message contains 'usage:'
```

Explanation of the bug:
The function `match` is checking if the second element of `command.script.split()` is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, in the case where the command is just 'git', `command.script.split()` will only contain one element, which is 'git'. This causes an `IndexError` because you are trying to access the second element of the list, which does not exist.

The corrected function checks if 'git' is in the first element of the split command, which will be true for all git commands. This ensures that the function will not fail when the command is just 'git'. The rest of the function remains the same.

The test function `test_not_match` should now pass:

```
# The relative path of the failing test file: tests/rules/test_git_fix_stash.py

def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```
