Here is the bug analysis:

1. The bug is in the `match` function in the `git_fix_stash.py` file.
2. The function is supposed to check if the `git` command is running with the `stash` subcommand and if the output contains the string `usage:`.
3. The bug is caused by the fact that the `command.script` might not contain the expected information, i.e., the `stash` subcommand.
4. When the `command.script` is a simple `git` command without any arguments, the `script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` because there are not enough elements in the list.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the `script.split()` list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@ git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version of the `match` function will correctly handle the case where the `command.script` is a simple `git` command without any arguments.

Please note that this corrected version of the `match` function will pass the failing test `test_not_match` and resolve the issues posted in GitHub.
