The bug in the provided function is located in this line:
```
command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```
The issue occurs because the provided command may not have a command name as the second element after splitting the script into a list. This could happen if the command is not `git stash` and hence, there is no second element in the list. 

To fix this bug, we can check if the command has a length greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. Here's a corrected version of the function:
```
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In this corrected version, `len(command.script.split()) > 1` checks if the command's script has more than one element. If it does, then we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. If all these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating a match. If not, the function returns `False`.

The GitHub issue title correctly describes the issue. According to the issue description, the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just `git`. This failure is due to the bug in the `match` function, which tries to access the second element of the command's script when the command is simply `git`.
