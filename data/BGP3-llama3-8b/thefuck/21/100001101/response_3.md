Here's a step-by-step analysis and correction of the buggy function:

1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the runtime input/output values, the expected input/output values:
The function is supposed to match Git commands that use the `stash` command and have an error message containing the text `usage:`. 

2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
The buggy function is `match(command)`. The potential error locations are in the return condition where it checks if `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` and `command.stderr` contains `usage:`.

3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the runtime input/output variable values, the expected input/output variable values:
The bug is that the function is not correctly splitting the command script. The `split()` function is not correctly splitting the command due to the presence of newline characters in the `command.stderr`. This is because `command.script` is not the full command, it's `git` in this case. 

4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
Correctly split the command script, and correctly check if the error message contains `usage:`.

5. Provided a corrected version:
Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'git' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
I removed the unnecessary `split()` and instead checked if 'git' is in the command script. This allows the function to correctly match Git commands that start with 'git'.
