Let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the test code.

The buggy function `match(command)` is a Git rule that checks if the Git command is a `stash` command and if the output contains the string `usage:`.

The test function `test_not_match()` is supposed to test that the `match()` function returns `False` when the Git command is a `stash` command. However, the test is failing because the `match()` function is returning `True` even when the command is a `stash` command.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

* The command object's `script` attribute, which is supposed to contain the command executed. However, it's not checked if the command is actually a `stash` command or if the output contains the string `usage:`.
* The command object's `stderr` attribute, which is supposed to contain the error message. However, it's not checked if the error message contains the string `usage:` or if it's an exact match.

The cause of the bug is that the `match()` function is only checking if the command contains the string `stash` in the script and if the output contains the string `usage:`, but it's not checking if the output is an exact match or if the command is actually a `stash` command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match()` function to correctly check if the command is a `stash` command and if the output contains the string `usage:`.
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script.split()[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
In the corrected version, we first check if the command is a `stash` command by checking if the second element of the command script is `stash`. If it is, we then check if the output contains the string `usage:`. If both conditions are met, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.
