The bug in the `match` function is that it's trying to access the second element of `command.script.split()` when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which is the first element of the list.

The `match` function should check if the command is `git` and `stash` is in the error message before trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script == 'git stash' or 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr
```
This function will return `True` if the command is `git stash` or if the error message contains `usage: git stash`. This should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to identify the potential error location within the buggy function, which is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. Then, analyze the failing test and the runtime input/output values to understand the cause of the bug. In this case, the bug is caused by trying to access the second element of `command.script.split()` when the command is just `'git'`. The corrected function checks if the command is `git stash` or if `usage: git stash` is in the error message before trying to access the second element of `command.script.split()`.
