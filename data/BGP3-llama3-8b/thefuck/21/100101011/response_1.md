The bug in the function is due to the assumption that `command.script.split()[1]` will always be a valid index, but this is not necessarily true. In this case, if the command is just `git` without any additional arguments, then `split()` will only return a list with one element `['git']`, and attempting to access an index that does not exist (`command.script.split()[1]`) will raise an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we handle the case where `command.script.split()` returns a list of length 1. One way to do this is by checking if the length of the list is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
@github_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This function will correctly identify if the command is `git stash` and the stdout contains 'usage:'. If these conditions are not met, the function will return `False`.
