The bug in the provided function `match` is that it is trying to access the second element of the `script` list (`command.script.split()[1]`) but there might not be enough elements in the list to access. This is happening when the `git` command is run directly without any arguments, i.e., `git`. In this case, `command.script.split()` will return `['git']` because there is only one word in the command, and `command.script.split()[1]` would raise an `IndexError`.

Here is the corrected function:

```
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    args = command.script.split()
    return len(args) > 1 and args[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In the corrected function, I added a check `len(args) > 1` to ensure that there are at least two elements in the `args` list before trying to access the second element (`args[1]`). This should fix the `IndexError` and make the test pass.

Now, the function should correctly identify the `git stash` command and return `True` if `command.stderr` contains the string `usage:`.
