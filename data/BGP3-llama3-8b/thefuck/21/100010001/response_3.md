Based on the provided code, the buggy function is designed to match the `git` command and its output. The function uses the `git_support` decorator from `thefuck.specific.git` to handle the command and return a boolean value indicating whether the command should be executed or not.

The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` is raised because the `command.script.split()[1]` is trying to access the second element of a list, but the list is empty (i.e., the index is out of range). This happens when the `git` command is not followed by the `stash` keyword, which is the expected condition for the function to match.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle cases where the `git` command is not followed by the `stash` keyword. In these cases, splitting the script by spaces returns an empty list, and accessing the second element of the list raises an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, we can add a condition to check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. If the length is 1 or less, it means the `git` command is not followed by the `stash` keyword, and we can return `False` or perform any other desired action.

Here is the corrected function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.split().count('stash') > 0 and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we use the `count` method to check if the word 'stash' appears at least once in the split script. If it does, we check if 'usage:' is in the stderr message. This way, we correctly handle cases where the `git` command is not followed by the `stash` keyword.
