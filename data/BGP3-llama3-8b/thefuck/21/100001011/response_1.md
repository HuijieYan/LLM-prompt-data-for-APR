The bug in the function is that it's assuming that the script of the command will always have at least two elements when split by space. But in this case, the command is just 'git', which only has one element when split. 

The corrected function should handle this case correctly. Here is the corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script == 'git stash' or ('usage:' in command.stderr and command.script.split()[0] == 'git')
```

The function now checks if the script is 'git stash' directly. If not, it checks if the script starts with 'git' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. This way, it correctly handles both cases where the script is 'git stash' and where it's just 'git'.
