The bug in the given function is that when the command script is simply "git", it returns an empty list from `command.script.split()`. Then when it tries to access `split()[1]`, it raises an `IndexError` because there is no index 1 to access.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```Python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git stash ') or 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected function, we instead check if the command starts with 'git stash ' or if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This will correctly identify when the command starts with 'git stash ', or when the command results in a 'usage:' error message.
