The buggy function is supposed to match a Git command based on specific conditions. The conditions are: (1) the second word in the script should be 'stash', and (2) the stderr should contain the string 'usage:'. 

The bug in the function is that it splits the stderr using the `split()` method which splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. But we are checking if 'usage:' is in this list which might not work if there is a newline character in the stderr. 

Also, the bug is that we are splitting the command.script (which is a string representing the command) using `split()[1]` which would return the second word in the command, but if the command is 'git stash' then this would be 'stash'. We want to match the command 'git stash', not just 'stash'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script == 'git stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we are comparing the entire command.script with 'git stash' directly, not just checking the second word. Also, we don't need to split the stderr because 'usage:' is assuming there's no newline character in the stderr.
