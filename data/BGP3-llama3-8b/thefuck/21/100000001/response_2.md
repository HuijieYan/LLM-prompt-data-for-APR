**Step 1: Analyze the buggy function**

The buggy function `match` is a rule in the "thefuck" project, which aims to fix common mistakes in command-line applications, specifically Git. The function is supposed to determine whether a given Git command can be auto-corrected by the "thefuck" tool.

**Step 2: Identify potential error locations within the buggy function**

The function takes a `command` object as input, which has `script` and `stderr` attributes. The function checks if the script part of the command contains the string "stash" and if the stderr output contains the string "usage:".

**Step 3: Explain the cause of the bug**

The bug in this function is that it is checking the script part of the command for the string "stash" as if it was averbatim part of the command. What it actually needs to check is whether the command being run is "git stash" or not.

**Step 4: Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix this bug, we can split the command script by spaces and check if the second element of the split array is "stash". This way, we will be checking if the command is indeed "git stash" and not just "stash" inside a longer script.

**Step 5: Corrected version of the buggy function**

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.stdout.startswith('fatal: bad ref ') and
            command.script.split()[1] == 'stash')
```

In this corrected version, we check if the command's output starts with "fatal: bad ref " (which is a common error message for "git stash") and also if the second part of the command is "stash".
