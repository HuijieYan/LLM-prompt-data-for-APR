Based on the provided information, I will analyze the buggy function, identify potential error locations, explain the cause of the bug, suggest a strategy for fixing the bug, and provide a corrected version.

**Buggy Function:**

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

**Analysis:**

1. The function is supposed to check if the command is `git stash` and if the output contains the string `'usage:'`. However, there seems to be a logical error in the implementation.
2. The `command.script` is split into a list, and the second element of the list (`[1]`) is compared with `'stash'`. This approach is incorrect as the `command.script` is `'git'` and not a list of commands.

**Potential Error Locations:**

1. The line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is the main culprit.

**Cause of the Bug:**

The bug is caused by incorrectly splitting the `command.script` and comparing the second element of the list with `'stash'`.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

1. Correctly split the `command.script` only if necessary (e.g., if it's a multi-word command).
2. Check if the entire `command.script` matches `'git stash'` instead of splitting it.

**Corrected Function:**

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script == 'git stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected function directly compares the `command.script` with `'git stash'` instead of splitting it. This ensures that the entire command is matched correctly. Additionally, the comparison with `'usage:'` in `command.stderr` remains unchanged.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test `test_not_match`.
