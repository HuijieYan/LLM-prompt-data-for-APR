## Analysis

The buggy function is supposed to match `git stash` commands with a usage message. However, the `match` function has a logical error. It checks if the command script is 'stash' and if there's a 'usage:' in the command's stderr. This is too broad and will match commands other than `git stash` that have a 'usage:' message in their stderr.

The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function will return `False` for a command that is actually matching the expected criteria.

## Error Locations

The error is in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This is because the `split` function splits the command string by spaces, and the actual command is 'git stash', not the word 'stash'. Also, the `command.stderr` check is too broad and will match other commands that have a 'usage:' message in their stderr.

## Cause of the Bug

The bug is caused by the incorrect assumption that the command script can be split by spaces to get the actual command, which is not true. Also, the `command.stderr` check is too broad and does not check for the correct message.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

The strategy is to filter out all commands that do not start with 'git stash' and then check if the stderr message starts with 'usage: git stash'.

## Corrected Function

Here is the corrected function:

```
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()[0]
    return script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected function, I first split the command script by spaces and get the first element, which is the actual command. Then I check if this command starts with 'git stash' and if the stderr message starts with 'usage: git stash'.
