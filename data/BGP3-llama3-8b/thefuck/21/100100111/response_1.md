The buggy function tries to split the command's script by spaces and then access the second element (index 1) which may be out of range. This happens when the script's split result is a list with fewer than 2 elements, like `['git']`.

The issue's detailed description suggests a git command that simply says `git`. In this case, `command.script.split()` results in `['git']`, which doesn't have an index 1. Therefore, the program throws an `IndexError`.

To resolve the issue, we need to add a condition to ensure that the script's split result has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

In this corrected version, we first split the command's script by spaces and store the result in `split_script`. Then we check if the length of `split_script` is at least 2 before accessing the second element. If the length is less than 2, we return `False` to avoid the `IndexError`.
