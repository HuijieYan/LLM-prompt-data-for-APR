The buggy function is `match` which is decorated with `git_support`. The function is supposed to return True if the command is a 'git stash' command with a 'usage:' message in the output, and False otherwise.

The bug is in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. The problem is that the command.script value is just 'git', not 'git stash', so splitting it with spaces will only give one element in the list.

Another potential error is that the command.stderr value contains the usage message, but it's not clear whether the message starts with 'usage:' or is simply a string that contains 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@ git_support
def match(command):
    return 'git stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, we are checking if 'git stash' is in the command.script value, not just whether the second element of the split command.script value is 'stash'. This ensures that the function correctly identifies 'git stash' commands, including those with options.
