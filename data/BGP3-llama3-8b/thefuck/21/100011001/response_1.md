The buggy function is `match` which is decorated with `git_support`. The function is supposed to return True if the command is a 'git stash' command with a 'usage:' message in the output, and False otherwise.

The bug is in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. The bug is that the `split` method can raise an `IndexError` if the input string does not contain any spaces. In this case, the input string is just `'git'`, so there is no space, and hence no second element in the list returned by `split`. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the list.

The corrected version of the function would be:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, we are checking if the string `'stash'` is in `command.script` and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`, regardless of whether there is a space in the input string. This ensures that the function works correctly for all inputs, not just those that have a space.
