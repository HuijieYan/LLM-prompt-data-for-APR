### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is `match` that takes a `Command` object as an input. It returns `True` if the command's script is `git stash` and its stderr contains the string `usage:`.

### Identifying potential error locations

From the provided error message and test case, we can see that the error occurs at `command.script.split()[1]`. This suggests that the index `[1]` might be out of range, which is because the `script` attribute of the `Command` object is a multi-line string containing the usage message of the `git stash` command. Splitting this string by spaces will not result in an array with more than one element.

### Cause of the bug

The bug is due to the incorrect assumption in the `match` function that the `script` attribute of the `Command` object is a single line command. Hence, the function fails when trying to access the second element of the split script string, resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to handle multi-line commands in the `script` attribute. We can do this by removing leading and trailing whitespace from each line of the script and joining them into a single string.

### Corrected version

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_lines = [line.strip() for line in command.script.splitlines()]
    script = ' '.join(script_lines)
    return script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
This version of the function properly handles multi-line commands in the `script` attribute and should pass the failing test.
