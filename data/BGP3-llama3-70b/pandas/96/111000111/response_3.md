The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function takes a `datetime` object as input and applies a business hour offset to it. The offset is determined by the `n` attribute of the class instance, which represents the number of business hours to add or subtract.

The bug in the function is related to the way it handles the edge cases when the input date is on a holiday or outside of the business hour range. In these cases, the function should adjust the date to the next or previous business day, but it doesn't do so correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the function to handle these edge cases correctly. Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        #... (rest of the function remains the same)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        #... (rest of the function remains the same)

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
The changes I made were:

1. In the `if n >= 0` branch, I added a check to see if the input date is on a holiday or outside of the business hour range. If so, I adjust the date to the next business day using the `_next_opening_time` method.
2. In the `else` branch, I added a similar check to see if the input date is on a holiday or outside of the business hour range. If so, I adjust the date to the previous business day using the `_prev_opening_time` method.

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle edge cases when the input date is on a holiday or outside of the business hour range.
