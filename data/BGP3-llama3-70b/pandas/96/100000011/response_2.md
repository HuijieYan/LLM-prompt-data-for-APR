Let's break down the bug and provide a corrected version of the function.

**Analysis and Error Identification**

The buggy function is `apply(self, other)` in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`, which is related to the `CustomBusinessHour` offset in Pandas. The bug is causing `pd.date_range` to produce more periods than expected when using `periods` and adding holidays.

The error is likely in the logic of the `apply` function, which adjusts the datetime object `other` by the specified business hour offset.

**Cause of the Bug**

The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of the datetime object `other` when `n` (the number of periods) is negative. In the `else` branch of the `if n >= 0` block, the function subtracts one second from `other` and then adjusts it to the previous business day. However, this adjustment is not correct, leading to an incorrect result.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

To fix the bug, we need to correct the adjustment logic for negative `n` values. We can do this by adjusting `other` to the previous business day without subtracting one second, and then adjusting it further by the remaining business hours.

**Corrected Version**
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        #... (rest of the code remains the same until the else branch)

        else:
            # adjustment to move to previous business day
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        #... (rest of the code remains the same)
```
In the corrected version, we adjust `other` to the previous business day using `_prev_opening_time` without subtracting one second. Then, we check if `other` is still on a business day, and if not, we adjust it further to the next business day and its closing time.

This corrected version should fix the bug and produce the correct result when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays.
