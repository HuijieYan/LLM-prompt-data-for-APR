The provided code has several issues. 

1. The function does not handle the case when `other` is not a datetime object. 

2. The function does not correctly adjust the business hours when `n` is negative.

3. The function does not correctly adjust the business hours when `other` is not within the business hours.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
    other = datetime(
        other.year,
        other.month,
        other.day,
        other.hour,
        other.minute,
        other.second,
        other.microsecond,
    )

    n = self.n

    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
    businesshours = sum(
        self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
        for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
    )

    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r

    if bd!= 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        other = other + skip_bd

    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    while bhour_remain!= timedelta(0):
        bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
        if bhour_remain < bhour:
            other += bhour_remain
            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            bhour_remain -= bhour
            other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
    
    return other
```

This function first adjusts `other` to be at the next opening time if it is not within the business hours. Then it calculates the total business hours to adjust by dividing `n` by the total business hours in a day. The remaining minutes are then adjusted by adding the remaining time to `other` and adjusting `other` to the next opening time if necessary.
