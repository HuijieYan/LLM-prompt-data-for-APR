The buggy function is the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The bug is related to how the function handles the business hour offset when the start time is not on a business hour.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH` (Custom Business Hour). This suggests that the `apply` method is not correctly implementing the business hour offset when the start time is not on a business hour.

The cause of the bug is due to the way the `apply` method adjusts the start time to the next business hour when the start time is not on a business hour. The method uses the `_next_opening_time` method to adjust the start time, but it does not correctly handle the case when the start time is not on a business hour.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply` method to correctly handle the case when the start time is not on a business hour. Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        #... (rest of the code remains the same)
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.start:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.end:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        #... (rest of the code remains the same)
```
The changes made to the `apply` method are:

* Added a check to see if the start time is not in the `start` list when `n >= 0`. If it's not, adjust the start time to the next business hour using the `_next_opening_time` method.
* Added a check to see if the start time is in the `end` list when `n < 0`. If it is, subtract one second from the start time to move it to the previous business hour.

With these changes, the `apply` method should correctly implement the business hour offset when the start time is not on a business hour.
