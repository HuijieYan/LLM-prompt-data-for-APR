To fix the buggy function, we need to analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the test code, identify potential error locations, explain the cause of the bug, and suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.

Analysis:

The buggy function is `apply` method in `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is responsible for applying a business hour offset to a datetime object. The test code is trying to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency, including a holiday on November 26, 2020.

Potential error locations:

1. The `apply` method is not correctly handling the case when the input datetime is on a holiday.
2. The `apply` method is not correctly handling the case when the input datetime is not on a business hour.

Cause of the bug:

The bug is caused by the fact that the `apply` method is not correctly handling the case when the input datetime is on a holiday or not on a business hour. The method is not checking if the input datetime is a holiday or not on a business hour before applying the offset.

Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Add a check to see if the input datetime is a holiday or not on a business hour.
2. If the input datetime is a holiday, skip it and move to the next business day.
3. If the input datetime is not on a business hour, move it to the next business hour.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        #...
        # Add a check to see if the input datetime is a holiday or not on a business hour
        if self._is_holiday(other) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        #...
        # rest of the code remains the same
```
In the corrected version, we added a check to see if the input datetime is a holiday or not on a business hour using the `_is_holiday` and `_is_on_offset` methods. If the input datetime is a holiday or not on a business hour, we move it to the next business hour using the `_next_opening_time` method.

Note that the `_is_holiday` method is not implemented in the provided code, so we need to implement it to check if a datetime is a holiday. The implementation of `_is_holiday` method depends on the specific holiday rules and calendar used.
