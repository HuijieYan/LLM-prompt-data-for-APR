After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code, and the GitHub issue, I identified potential error locations within the buggy function. The bug is related to the handling of business hours and holidays in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` method does not correctly handle the case where the start date is a holiday. When the start date is a holiday, the method should skip it and move to the next business day. However, the current implementation does not do this correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` method:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        #...
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            # Check if other is a holiday, if so, skip it
            if other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            #...
    
        #...
        
        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        #...
        
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd!= 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        #...
```
The main change is the addition of a check for holidays when adjusting the start date. If the start date is a holiday, it is skipped by moving to the next business day using the `_next_opening_time` method.

With this corrected implementation, the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass, and the issue reported in GitHub should be resolved.
