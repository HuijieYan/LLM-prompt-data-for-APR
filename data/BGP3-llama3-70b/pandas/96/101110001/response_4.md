The bug in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class lies in the way it adjusts the input `datetime` object `other` to reduce the number of cases to handle. Specifically, when `n` is negative, the method adjusts `other` by subtracting one second and then calling `_next_opening_time` and `_get_closing_time` methods. However, this adjustment is not correct and leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for negative `n` values. Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        #...
        
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
        #...
```
The key change is to call `_prev_opening_time` method twice when `n` is negative, instead of calling `_next_opening_time` and `_get_closing_time` methods. This ensures that the input `datetime` object `other` is correctly adjusted to the previous business day.

With this corrected implementation, the `apply` method should pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
