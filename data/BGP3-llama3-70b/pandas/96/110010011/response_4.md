Here is the analysis and fix for the buggy function:

**Analysis**

The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The error occurs when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency that includes holidays. The issue is that the `apply` function does not correctly handle the holiday dates when calculating the next business hour.

**Error Location**

The error location is in the `apply` function, specifically in the while loops that adjust the business hours.

**Cause of the Bug**

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of holiday dates when calculating the next business hour. When a holiday date is encountered, the function should skip over it and adjust the business hour accordingly. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case, leading to an incorrect result.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to correctly handle holiday dates when calculating the next business hour. We can do this by checking if the current date is a holiday date and adjusting the business hour accordingly.

**Corrected Version**

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        #... (rest of the function remains the same)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while self._is_holiday(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while self._is_holiday(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        #... (rest of the function remains the same)
```
The changes made were:

* Added a `while` loop to check if the current date is a holiday date and adjust the business hour accordingly.
* Called the `_is_holiday` method to check if the current date is a holiday date.

Note that the `_is_holiday` method is not defined in the provided code, so it will need to be implemented separately.
