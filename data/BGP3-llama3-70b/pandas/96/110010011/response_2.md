**Analysis and Error Location**

The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is used to implement custom business hour offsets. The error occurs when trying to generate a date range using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.

The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency. This suggests that the `apply` method is not correctly implementing the custom business hour offset, leading to incorrect date generation.

**Cause of the Bug**

The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `apply` method, specifically in handling holidays and adjusting the date accordingly.

When `n` is negative, the method adjusts the date to the previous business day, but it does not correctly handle the case where the previous business day is also a holiday. This leads to incorrect date generation and, ultimately, the error message.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

To fix the bug, we need to correct the implementation of the `apply` method to handle holidays correctly. This involves:

1. Correctly adjusting the date when `n` is negative and the previous business day is a holiday.
2. Ensuring that the method correctly handles edge cases, such as when the start date is a holiday.

**Corrected Version**

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        #... (rest of the method remains the same)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)  # corrected line
                while other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        #... (rest of the method remains the same)
```
The corrected line uses `self._prev_opening_time` to adjust the date to the previous business day, and then checks if the resulting date is a holiday. If it is, it recursively adjusts the date until it finds a non-holiday business day.
