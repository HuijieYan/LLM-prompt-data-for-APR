The buggy function is a decorator `@git_support` decorated function `match` in `thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py`. 

The function `match` takes a `command` as an argument and returns `True` if the second word in the script is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the stderr, otherwise it returns `False`.

The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` implies that the function is trying to access an element in the list that does not exist.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes that the script will always have at least two words, but in the failing test, the script is just 'git', so `command.script.split()[1]` raises an `IndexError` because there is no second element in the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected function first splits the script into words, then checks if there are more than one word (to avoid the `IndexError`), and finally checks if the second word is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the stderr.
