Here is the analysis and correction of the buggy function:

**Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is decorated with `@git_support` and is supposed to match a specific condition in a git command. The condition is that the second argument of the command script is 'stash' and the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the function is throwing an `IndexError: list index out of range` exception.

**Potential error locations**

The error is likely occurring at the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This line is trying to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()`, but the list only contains one element, hence the `IndexError`.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script.split()` will always return a list with at least two elements. However, in the failing test case, `command.script` is simply `'git'`, which means `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, `['git']`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we don't try to access an index that is out of range. We can do this by checking the length of the list returned by `command.script.split()` before trying to access its elements.

**Corrected version**

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into a list of parts using `command.script.split()`. Then, we check if the length of the list is greater than 1 before trying to access its second element. This ensures that we don't get an `IndexError` when the script only contains one argument.
