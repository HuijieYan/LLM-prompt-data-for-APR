The bug in the given function is that it does not check if the `command.script` has at least two elements after splitting by space. When `command.script` is just `'git'`, `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` because there is no element at index 1.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This function will first split the `command.script` into parts by space. Then it checks if the resulting list has more than one element and the second element is `'stash'`, and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`.
