The buggy function provided is designed to match a specific Git command, specifically `git stash`, and check if the error message contains the string `'usage:'`. 

However, the function is buggy because it assumes that the command script will always have at least two words (i.e., `command.script.split()[1]`). But in the case where the command is just `'git'`, this will raise an `IndexError` because the list `command.script.split()` will only have one element, and therefore `command.script.split()[1]` will be out of range.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, we first split the command script into words. Then we check if the list of words has more than one element (to avoid the `IndexError`). If it does, we check if the second word is `'stash'` and if the error message contains `'usage:'`. If all these conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
