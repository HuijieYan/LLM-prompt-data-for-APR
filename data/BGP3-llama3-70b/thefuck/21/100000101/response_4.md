The buggy function is supposed to match a Git command that is calling `git stash` with incorrect parameters, hence resulting in a usage message being printed to stderr. 

However, the function is currently checking if the second element of the split command script is 'stash', which is incorrect because the Git command is the first element, not the second. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git' 
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Explanation:

- `command.script.split()[0] == 'git'` checks if the command is a Git command.
- `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` checks if the Git command is specifically `git stash`.
- `'usage:' in command.stderr` checks if the command resulted in a usage message being printed to stderr, indicating that the command was used with incorrect parameters.

This corrected function will match a Git command that is calling `git stash` with incorrect parameters, which is the expected behavior.
