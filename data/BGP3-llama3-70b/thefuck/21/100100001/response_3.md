Here's the analysis and correction of the buggy function:

**Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is part of a Git fix stash rule in the `thefuck` project. It takes a `command` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the command matches the rule. The function is decorated with `@git_support`, which suggests that it's specific to Git commands.

The function checks two conditions:

1. The second word of the command script is `stash`.
2. The command's standard error output contains the string `usage:`.

If both conditions are true, the function returns `True`.

The failing test `test_not_match` checks that the `match` function returns `False` for a specific `Command` object with a certain standard error output (`git_stash_err`).

**Potential error locations**

1. The `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` condition might fail if the command script doesn't have at least two words.
2. The `'usage:' in command.stderr` condition might fail if `command.stderr` is not a string or is `None`.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is likely due to the assumption that `command.script` is always a non-empty string and that `command.stderr` is always a string. If either of these assumptions is false, the function will raise an error.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

1. Add error handling to ensure that `command.script` and `command.stderr` are valid before attempting to access their properties.
2. Use safer and more explicit conditions to check the values of `command.script` and `command.stderr`.

**Corrected version**
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if not command.script or len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    if not command.stderr or not isinstance(command.stderr, str):
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the corrected version, we added checks to ensure that:

* `command.script` is not empty and has at least two words.
* `command.stderr` is not empty and is a string.

If either of these checks fails, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it evaluates the original conditions using safer and more explicit checks.
