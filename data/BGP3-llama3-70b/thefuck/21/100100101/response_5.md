The buggy function is supposed to match a git command with a 'stash' option and check if the stderr of the command contains 'usage:'.

However, the function is only checking if the second element of the split command script is 'stash', which is not correct. The correct way is to check if 'stash' is anywhere in the command script.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Explanation:
- The bug in the function is that it's checking if the second element of the split command script is 'stash', which is not correct. The correct way is to check if 'stash' is anywhere in the command script.
- The corrected function uses the `in` operator to check if 'stash' is a substring of `command.script`.
- This function will now correctly match a git command with a 'stash' option and check if the stderr of the command contains 'usage:'.

The corrected function will pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values.
