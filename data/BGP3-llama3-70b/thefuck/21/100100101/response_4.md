The buggy function is not correctly checking if the command is a `git stash` command. The function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash', but it's not considering the case where the command script only contains 'git stash' without any additional arguments.

The bug is in this line: `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. When the command script is only 'git stash', `command.script.split()` will return a list with two elements 'git' and 'stash', and therefore `command.script.split()[1]` will correctly return 'stash'. But when the command script is 'git stash list' or 'git stash show', `command.script.split()` will return a list with three or more elements, and `command.script.split()[1]` will return the second word, which is 'stash', but the function will not correctly identify the command as a 'git stash' command.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to check if 'stash' is in the command script, instead of checking if it's the second word. Here is the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This function will correctly identify if the command is a `git stash` command, regardless of the number of arguments. It will return `True` if the command script contains 'stash' and the standard error contains 'usage:', and `False` otherwise.

This corrected function will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
