After analyzing the buggy function, the failing test, and the runtime input/output values, I've identified the potential error location and the cause of the bug.

**Buggy function:**
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
**Failing test:**
```python
def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```
**Runtime values and types of variables:**

### Case 1

* `command.script`: `'git'` (str)
* `command`: `Command(script=git, stdout=, stderr=...)` (Command object)
* `command.stderr`: `'\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'` (str)

**Error analysis:**

The bug is caused by the incorrect assumption that `command.script` always contains a space-separated list of words, and the second word (`split()[1]`) is the Git subcommand.

In Case 1, `command.script` is simply `'git'`, which doesn't contain a space. Therefore, `command.script.split()[1]` raises an `IndexError` because there is no second element in the split result.

**Fix strategy:**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we can correctly extract the Git subcommand from `command.script`. Since `command.script` can be a single word or a space-separated list of words, we need to handle both cases.

**Corrected function:**
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In this corrected version, we split `command.script` into a list of words using `split()`. We then check if the list has more than one element (i.e., there is a subcommand) and if the second element is `'stash'`. Finally, we check if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`.

This corrected function should pass the failing test.
