After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, I identified the potential error location: the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`.

Here's the explanation of the bug:

The `match` function is supposed to return `True` if the input command is `git stash` and the stderr contains `usage:`. However, the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` will always be `False` because `command.script` is just `'git'`, and splitting it will result in a list with only one element, which is `'git'`.

The failing test `test_not_match` expects the `match` function to return `False` because the input command is just `git`, not `git stash`. However, the buggy function will return `True` because `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` (out of range), and the `and` operator will short-circuit, making the function return `True`.

To fix the bug, I suggest the following strategy:

1. Check if the command script contains `stash` instead of relying on splitting the script and checking the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_not_match`.
