The buggy function is:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Analysis:

1. The function is supposed to match a specific command pattern for `git stash`.
2. The `IndexError: list index out of range` error occurs when the function tries to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list, but the list has only one element.
3. This happens when the input command is just `git`, without any arguments.

Potential error locations:

1. The `command.script.split()[1]` expression assumes that the command script always has at least two words. However, this is not always the case, as seen in the error message.

Cause of the bug:

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the command script is just `git`, without any arguments. In this case, `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, and trying to access the second element (`[1]`) raises an `IndexError`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Check if the `command.script.split()` list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.
2. If the list has only one element, return `False` or a default value to indicate that the command does not match the pattern.

Corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, we first split the command script into words using `command.script.split()`. Then, we check if the resulting list has more than one element using `len(words) > 1`. If it does, we check if the second element is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in the command's standard error output. If all conditions are true, the function returns `True`, indicating a match. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
