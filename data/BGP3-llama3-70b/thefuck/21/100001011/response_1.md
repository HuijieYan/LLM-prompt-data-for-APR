Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Here's the explanation of the bug and the fix:

**Analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the runtime input/output values, the GitHub issue:**

The buggy function is `match` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file, which is a rule for the `thefuck` tool. The function takes a `command` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the command matches the rule.

The GitHub issue describes a problem where the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just `git`. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` exception when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`.

**Potential error locations:**

The error is likely due to the assumption that `command.script.split()` always has at least two elements.

**Cause of the bug:**

The bug is caused by the fact that `command.script.split()[1]` is accessed without checking if the list has at least two elements. When the script is just `git`, `command.script.split()` returns a list with a single element `['git']`, and trying to access `command.script.split()[1]` raises an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we don't try to access an index that is out of range. We can do this by checking if the list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

**Corrected version:**

The corrected version of the function uses the `in` operator to check if the string `'stash'` is present in the split script. This approach avoids the `IndexError` and ensures that the function works correctly even when the script is just `git`.
