Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Let's break down the analysis and fixing process:

**Analysis**

The buggy function is designed to match a specific Git command, `git stash`, and return `True` if the command is invalid and the error message contains "usage:". The function takes a `command` object as input, which has attributes like `script`, `stdout`, and `stderr`.

The bug occurs when the input `command.script` is simply `'git'`, without any arguments. In this case, `command.script.split()[1]` raises an `IndexError` because the split list has only one element, and there is no second element to access.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` always has at least two words, which is not true when the user runs `git` without any arguments. The function does not handle this edge case, leading to the `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second element. We can do this by checking the length of the split list before accessing its elements.

**Corrected version**

The corrected function splits the `command.script` into a list of words and checks if the list has at least two elements before comparing the second element with `'stash'`. This ensures that the function does not raise an `IndexError` when `command.script` is simply `'git'`.

With this corrected version, the `git_fix_stash` rule should work correctly even when the user runs `git` without any arguments.
