After analyzing the buggy function, its relationship with the runtime input/output values, and the GitHub issue, I've identified the potential error locations within the buggy function.

**Potential error locations:**

1. `command.script.split()[1]`: This line of code assumes that `command.script` will always have at least two elements after splitting by spaces. However, in the provided case, `command.script` is just `'git'`, which would result in an IndexError when trying to access the second element (`[1]`).

**Cause of the bug:**

The bug is caused by the incorrect assumption that `command.script` will always have at least two elements after splitting by spaces. When `command.script` is just `'git'`, the `split()` method returns a list with only one element, and attempting to access the second element (`[1]`) raises an IndexError.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we handle the case where `command.script` has only one element after splitting by spaces. We can do this by checking the length of the split list before trying to access the second element.

**Corrected version:**
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the corrected version, we first split `command.script` into a list of parts using the `split()` method. Then, we check if the length of the list is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element (`script_parts[1]`). This ensures that we don't raise an IndexError when `command.script` has only one element.
