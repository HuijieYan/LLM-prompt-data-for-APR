After analyzing the buggy function, I identified the potential error location within the function. The issue lies in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`.

The cause of the bug is that the `command.script` might not always have a space in it, and therefore, `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the list.

The GitHub issue "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git" also indicates that the problem occurs when the script is just "git" without any arguments.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to check if the `command.script.split()` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 0 and (script_parts[0] == 'git' and (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' or 'usage:' in command.stderr))
```

This corrected function first splits the `command.script` into parts and then checks if the first part is 'git' and if there are more than one part, it checks if the second part is 'stash'. If there's only one part, it checks if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. This should fix the `IndexError` and make the function work correctly even when the script is just "git".
