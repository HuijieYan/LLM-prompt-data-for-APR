Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) > 0 and (splited_script[0] == 'git' and len(splited_script) == 1 or splited_script[1] == 'stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Let's break down the analysis and fix:

**Analysis**

The buggy function is a rule for the `thefuck` tool, specifically for fixing `git stash` commands. It's supposed to match the command `git stash` and return `True` if the command is invalid, indicating that the tool should suggest a fix.

**Potential error locations**

The error occurs in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. Specifically, the `IndexError: list index out of range` error suggests that the `command.script.split()` list has only one element, and we're trying to access the second element (`[1]`).

**Cause of the bug**

The bug occurs because the `command.script` is simply `'git'`, which, when split, results in a list with only one element: `['git']`. Therefore, when we try to access the second element (`[1]`) to check if it's equal to `'stash'`, we get the `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only access the second element of the `splited_script` list if it exists. We can do this by checking the length of the list before accessing its elements.

**Corrected version**

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into a list `splited_script`. Then, we check if the list has at least one element (`len(splited_script) > 0`) and if the first element is `'git'`. If it is, we then check if the list has only one element (`len(splited_script) == 1`), which means the command is simply `git`. If it's not, we check if the second element is `'stash'`. Finally, we check if the `'usage:'` string is in the `command.stderr`. If all these conditions are true, the function returns `True`.
