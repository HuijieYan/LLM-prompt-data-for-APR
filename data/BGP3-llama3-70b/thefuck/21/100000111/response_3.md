**Analysis of the buggy function**

The buggy function `match` takes a `command` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the command is a `git stash` command. The function is decorated with `@git_support`, which suggests that it's a rule specific to Git commands.

The function checks if the second element of the split `command.script` is equal to `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. However, the function is raising an `IndexError` when the `command.script` is just `'git'`.

**Potential error locations**

The error occurs when accessing the second element of `command.script.split()`, which implies that the split result has only one element.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` always contains at least two elements when split by whitespace. However, when the user runs `git` without any arguments, `command.script` is just `'git'`, which splits into a list with only one element, causing the `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the case where `command.script` has only one element. We can do this by checking the length of the split result before accessing its elements.

**Corrected version of the buggy function**

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split `command.script` into a list `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before accessing its second element. This ensures that we don't raise an `IndexError` when `command.script` has only one element.
