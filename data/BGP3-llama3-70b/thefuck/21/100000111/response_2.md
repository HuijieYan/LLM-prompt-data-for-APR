**Analysis of the buggy function:**

The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a `git` command is a stash command and if the standard error output contains the string `'usage:'`. The function is decorated with `@git_support`, which suggests that it's part of a Git-specific rule in the `thefuck` library.

The function takes a `command` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the command is a stash command.

**Potential error locations:**

1. `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` - This line assumes that the `script` attribute of the `command` object is a string that can be split into at least two parts using whitespace as the separator. If the `script` attribute is empty or only contains one word, this line will raise an `IndexError`.

**Cause of the bug:**

The bug occurs when the `script` attribute of the `command` object is a single word, such as `'git'`, and does not contain the word `'stash'`. In this case, the `split()` method returns a list with only one element, and attempting to access the second element (`[1]`) raises an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `script` attribute is split into a list of words and that we check the length of the list before accessing its elements. We can use a more robust way to check if the command is a stash command.

**Corrected version of the buggy function:**
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
**Explanation:**

In the corrected version, we split the `script` attribute into a list of words using `split()`. We then check if the list has at least two elements using `len(words) > 1`. If it does, we check if the second element is equal to `'stash'` using `words[1] == 'stash'`. Finally, we check if the standard error output contains the string `'usage:'` using `'usage:' in command.stderr`. If all these conditions are true, the function returns `True`, indicating that the command is a stash command.
