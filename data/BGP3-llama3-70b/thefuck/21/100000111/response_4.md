Let's break down the issue and fix the buggy function.

**Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is defined in `git_fix_stash.py` and is decorated with `git_support`. It takes a `command` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the command can be fixed by the `git_fix_stash` rule.

The function is expected to return `True` if the command is a `git stash` command with an error message containing `usage:`. However, the function is buggy and raises an `IndexError` when the input command script is simply `git`.

**Potential error locations**

1. `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`: This line is likely to cause an `IndexError` if the command script is just `git` and does not have a second element in the split list.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the command script will always have at least two elements after splitting on whitespace. However, when the command script is just `git`, the split list will have only one element, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle cases where the command script is just `git`. We can do this by checking the length of the split list before accessing its elements.

**Corrected version**

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In this corrected version, we first split the command script into a list of elements. We then check if the length of the list is greater than 1 before accessing its elements. This ensures that we don't get an `IndexError` when the command script is just `git`.
