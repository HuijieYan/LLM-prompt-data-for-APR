After analyzing the buggy function, test code, runtime input/output values, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, I have identified the potential error location and the cause of the bug.

**Potential error location:**
The line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)` in the `match` function.

**Cause of the bug:**
The bug occurs when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, and it doesn't contain any arguments. When `command.script.split()[1]` is executed, it raises an `IndexError` because the list `command.script.split()` has only one element, and there is no element at index 1.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script.split()[1]` expression doesn't raise an `IndexError` when `command.script` is just `'git'`. We can do this by checking the length of the `command.script.split()` list before accessing its elements.

**Corrected version:**
Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    args = command.script.split()
    return (len(args) > 1 and args[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This corrected version checks if the `args` list has more than one element before accessing its second element (`args[1]`). If the list has only one element, the function returns `False`.
