The buggy function `match` in `git_fix_stash.py` is causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split `command.script` list. This is because the `command.script` is just `'git'`, and when split, it becomes a list with only one element.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, and the function tries to access the second element of the split list, which does not exist.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `command.script` is just `'git'`. We can do this by checking the length of the split list before trying to access its elements.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This corrected version first splits the `command.script` into a list of parts. Then, it checks if the list has more than one element before trying to access the second element. If the list has more than one element and the second element is `'stash'`, and `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`, then the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
