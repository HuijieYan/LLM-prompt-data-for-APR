Let's go through the steps to fix the buggy function.

**Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is supposed to match the `git stash` command, but it fails when the script is just `git`. The function is decorated with `git_support`, which suggests that it's specific to Git commands.

The test function `test_not_match` fails because the `match` function raises an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list.

**Identifying potential error locations**

The potential error location is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. Specifically, the `command.script.split()[1]` part is suspicious.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug occurs because `command.script` is just `git`, which means `command.script.split()` returns a list with a single element `['git']`. When the function tries to access the second element (`[1]`) of this list, it raises an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function doesn't raise an `IndexError` when `command.script` is just `git`. We can do this by checking the length of the `command.script.split()` list before trying to access its elements.

**Corrected version**

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into a list of parts using `split()`. We then check if the length of the list is greater than 1 before trying to access its elements. This ensures that we don't raise an `IndexError` when `command.script` is just `git`.
