The issue in the buggy function is that it assumes that the `command.script` will always have at least two words, which is not the case when the user inputs just `git`. When `command.script` is just `git`, `command.script.split()` returns a list with one element, and therefore `command.script.split()[1]` raises an `IndexError` because it's trying to access the second element of a list that only has one element.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `command.script.split()` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, we first split `command.script` into parts using the `split()` method, which returns a list of words. We then check if the length of this list is greater than 1 using `len(script_parts) > 1`. If it is, we proceed to check if the second part of the script is `stash` and if `usage:` is in `command.stderr`. If all these conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
