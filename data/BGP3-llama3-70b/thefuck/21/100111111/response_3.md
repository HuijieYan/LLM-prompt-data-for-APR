**Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the given `command` matches the `git stash` usage pattern. The function splits the `command.script` by spaces and checks if the second element is equal to `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.

The failing test `test_not_match` is testing the `match` function with a `Command` object that has a script `'git'` and an error message that includes the `git stash` usage. The test expects the `match` function to return `False`, but it's raising an `IndexError` instead.

**Potential error locations**

1. `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`: This line assumes that `command.script` is always at least two words long. If `command.script` is only one word, this will raise an `IndexError`.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` is always at least two words long. In the failing test, `command.script` is only one word, `'git'`, which causes the `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script` is only one word. We can do this by checking the length of the split script before trying to access the second element.

**Corrected version**

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This corrected version checks if `script_parts` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If `script_parts` has only one element, the `len(script_parts) > 1` check will fail, and the function will return `False` without raising an `IndexError`.
