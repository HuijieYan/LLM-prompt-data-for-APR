The bug in the function is that it's trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if the list has at least two elements. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Explanation:

1. The function `match(command)` is trying to check if the command script is 'git stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'.

2. The bug in the function is that it's trying to access `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if `command.script.split()` has at least two elements.

3. The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the list `command.script.split()` has only one element, so trying to access `command.script.split()[1]` raises an IndexError.

4. The corrected function first splits the `command.script` into parts and then checks if the second part is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. It also checks if `script_parts` has at least two elements before trying to access `script_parts[1]`.
