The bug in this function occurs when the `command.script` is split into a list and then tries to access the element at index 1. If the `command.script` is only one word (like 'git'), it will raise an `IndexError: list index out of range` exception because there is no element at index 1.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected function will first split the `command.script` into a list of parts. Then it will check if the list has more than one element and if the second element is 'stash'. This approach ensures that the function doesn't try to access an index that might be out of range, thus avoiding the `IndexError`.
