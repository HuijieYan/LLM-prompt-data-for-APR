Here is the analysis and correction of the buggy function:

**Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is supposed to return `True` if the command is a `git stash` command and the error message contains "usage:". However, the function is raising an `IndexError` because `command.script.split()[1]` is trying to access the second element of the list, which does not exist when `command.script` is just `"git"`.

**Potential error locations**

1. `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`: This line assumes that `command.script` always has at least two elements after splitting.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` always has at least two elements after splitting. When `command.script` is just `"git"`, `split()` returns a list with only one element, and trying to access the second element (`[1]`) raises an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script` has only one element after splitting. We can do this by checking the length of the list before trying to access its elements.

**Corrected version**
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split `command.script` into a list of parts using `split()`. Then, we check if the list has at least two elements using `len(script_parts) > 1`. If it does, we check if the second element is `"stash"` and if the error message contains "usage:". If all conditions are true, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.
