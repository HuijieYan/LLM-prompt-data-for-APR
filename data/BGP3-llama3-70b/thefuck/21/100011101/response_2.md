Let's analyze the buggy function and identify the potential error location.

The buggy function is:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The error message is an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which suggests that the issue is with the `split()` method and the indexing of the resulting list.

The error occurs when `command.script.split()[1]` is executed, which implies that the `split()` method returns a list with fewer than two elements.

Looking at the runtime values, we can see that `command.script` is set to `'git'`, which means that `command.script.split()` will return a list with a single element `['git']`. Therefore, when we try to access the second element of the list with `command.script.split()[1]`, it raises an `IndexError` because the list only has one element.

The expected behavior is to return `True` if the command script is `'git stash'` and the error message contains `'usage:'`. However, the current implementation is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the case where the script is just `'git'`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check if the script starts with `'git stash'` instead of relying on indexing the split list. Here's the corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This implementation should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
