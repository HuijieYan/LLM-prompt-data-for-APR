The buggy function is `match` in `git_fix_stash.py`. It's supposed to return `True` if the command is `git stash` and the `stderr` contains the usage message, but it's not working correctly.

After analyzing the code, I identified the potential error location: `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This line is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash', but it's not considering the case where the command script is just 'git'.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case where the command script is just 'git'. In the failing test, the command script is 'git', but the function is still trying to split the script and check the second word, which doesn't exist.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly handle the case where the command script is just 'git' or has more than two words.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, I'm splitting the command script into words and checking if the length of the words is more than 1 (to ensure that the command has at least two words) and the second word is 'stash', and the `stderr` contains the usage message. This should correctly handle the case where the command script is 'git stash' or has more than two words.
