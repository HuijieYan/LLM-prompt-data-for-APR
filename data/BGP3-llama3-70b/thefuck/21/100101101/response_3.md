The buggy function is:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The bug is that `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` if `command.script` only contains one word, which is the case in the test.

The fix is to check if the split result has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
Explanation:

1. The buggy function tries to access the second element of the split result of `command.script`, but it doesn't check if the result has at least two elements. This causes an `IndexError` when `command.script` only contains one word.
2. The corrected version first splits `command.script` into a list of words, and then checks if the list has at least two elements before accessing the second element.
3. The test `test_not_match` fails because the buggy function returns `True` when it should return `False`. The corrected version fixes this by correctly handling the case where `command.script` only contains one word.

The corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
