The buggy function is intended to match a specific git command and its corresponding error message. The function `match` checks if the script part of the `command` is 'git' and if the error message contains 'usage:'.

However, the function is buggy because it checks if the second element of the split script is 'stash', which is not correct. The correct approach is to check if any of the elements of the split script is 'stash'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('git' in script_parts and 'stash' in script_parts 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This function will return `True` if the script starts with 'git', contains 'stash', and the error message contains 'usage:'. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

The bug in the original function is that it checks if the second element of the split script is 'stash', which may not always be the case. For example, if the script is `git stash list`, the second element would be 'stash' but if the script is `git foo stash`, the second element would not be 'stash'.

The corrected function fixes this bug by checking if 'stash' is anywhere in the script, not just as the second element.
