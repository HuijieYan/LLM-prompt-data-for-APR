Based on the error message and the buggy function, I can identify the potential error location within the buggy function.

The error location is in this line: `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This line assumes that `command.script` always has at least two elements after splitting by space. However, when the script is just "git" (i.e., `command.script == "git"`), `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, which causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element (`[1]`).

The cause of the bug is that the `match` function does not handle the case where the script is just "git". This is evident from the GitHub issue description, which shows the output of running `git` with no arguments, resulting in a usage message that does not contain the "stash" command.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `command.script.split()` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version first splits the script into parts and then checks if the length of the parts is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element (`parts[1]`). This ensures that the function does not throw an `IndexError` when the script is just "git".
