Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Explanation:

1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the test code, corresponding error message, and the GitHub issue:
The buggy function is `match` in `git_fix_stash.py`, which is decorated with `@git_support`. The test function `test_not_match` in `test_git_fix_stash.py` fails when calling the `match` function with a `Command` object having `script` as `'git'` and `stderr` as the `git_stash_err` message. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`.

2. Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error location is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`, specifically the part `command.script.split()[1]`.

3. Explaining the cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when the `script` property of the `Command` object is only `'git'`, which means `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element. When the code tries to access `command.script.split()[1]`, it raises an `IndexError` because there is no element at index 1.

4. Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we don't try to access an index that might be out of range. We can do this by checking the length of the `script_parts` list before accessing its elements.

The corrected version of the function checks the length of `script_parts` before accessing `script_parts[1]`, ensuring that we don't try to access an index that might be out of range. This fix should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
