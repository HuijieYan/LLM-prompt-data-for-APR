Based on the provided buggy function, test code, corresponding error message, and GitHub issue, I'll analyze the problem and provide a corrected version.

**Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is part of the `git_fix_stash` rule, which checks if the input command is a `git stash` command with an error message containing "usage:". The function returns a boolean indicating whether the rule matches.

The test function `test_not_match` fails because the input command is simply `git` without any arguments, which causes the `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` line to raise an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This is because `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, `['git']`, and there is no second element to access.

The GitHub issue describes the problem as the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just `git`.

**Potential error locations**

1. `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`: This line assumes that the command script always has at least two elements, which is not the case when the input command is simply `git`.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the input command is a simple `git` command without any arguments. In this case, `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, causing the `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

**Corrected version**

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split the command script into parts using `command.script.split()`. Then, we check if the resulting list has at least two elements using `len(script_parts) > 1`. If it does, we proceed to check if the second element is `stash` and if the error message contains "usage:". If all conditions are true, the function returns `True`, indicating a match.
