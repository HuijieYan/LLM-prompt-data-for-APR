Here is the analysis and the corrected version of the buggy function.

**Analysis**

The buggy function is `match` which is decorated with `@git_support`. It takes a `command` object as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the command matches a specific condition.

The condition is that the second element of the `command.script` split by spaces is equal to `'stash'` and the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.

The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` error, which means that the `command.script.split()` list has only one element, and therefore, trying to access the second element (`[1]`) raises an error.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script.split()` will always have at least two elements. However, in the failing test, `command.script` is `'git'`, which splits into a list with only one element: `['git']`. Therefore, trying to access the second element (`[1]`) raises an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we don't try to access the second element of the list if it doesn't exist. We can do this by checking the length of the list before trying to access its elements.

**Corrected version**

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split `command.script` into a list of parts using the `split()` method. Then, we check if the length of the list is greater than 1 before trying to access its second element. If the length is greater than 1, we check if the second element is equal to `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. If all conditions are true, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
