The buggy function is:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The bug in this function is that it assumes that `command.script` will always have at least two words, which is not the case when the command is simply "git". 

When the command is "git", `command.script.split()` returns `['git']`, which has only one element. Therefore, when the function tries to access `command.script.split()[1]`, it raises an `IndexError` because the list index is out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `command.script.split()` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Here is the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected function, we first split `command.script` into parts. Then we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1. If it is, we check if the second part is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. If `script_parts` has only one element, the function will return `False` without trying to access the second element, thus avoiding the `IndexError`.
