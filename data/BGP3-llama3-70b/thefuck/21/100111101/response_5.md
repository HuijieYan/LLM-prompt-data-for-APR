The bug in the code is that it assumes that `command.script` will always have at least two parts when split by spaces, but in the test case, `command.script` is just `'git'`, so `command.script.split()[1]` raises an `IndexError` because there is no second element in the list.

The fix for this bug is to check the length of the list before trying to access its elements. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, `parts` is a list of words in the `command.script`. The function checks if `parts` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element (`parts[1]`). This prevents the `IndexError` from being raised.
