The buggy function is designed to match a specific Git command, but it has a bug when the Git command is simply "git" without any arguments. In this case, `command.script.split()[1]` raises an `IndexError` because the list only has one element.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
Explanation:

1. The bug is caused by the indexing issue in the original code, where it assumes that `command.script.split()` always has at least two elements.
2. To fix this, we need to check the length of the `script_parts` list before trying to access its elements.
3. We use `len(script_parts) > 1` to ensure that the list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element (`script_parts[1]`).
4. The rest of the logic remains the same, checking if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

With this corrected version, the `match` function should pass the failing test and correctly handle the case where the Git command is simply "git" without any arguments.
