The error occurs because the input command is `git` and when the function splits the command script by space, it results in a list with only one element `['git']`. Therefore, when the function tries to access the second element of the list (`command.script.split()[1]`), it raises an `IndexError` because the list only has one element.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the command script is `git` and doesn't have any arguments. Here is the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected function, we first split the command script into parts. Then we check if the length of the parts is more than 1 (i.e., the command has an argument) and the second part is `stash`, and also if the `stderr` contains `usage:`. This ensures that the function returns True only when the command is `git stash` and the `stderr` contains the usage message.
