A delightful bug-hunting adventure!

Let's break down the issue step by step:

**Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is decorated with `git_support`, which suggests that it's related to Git commands. The function takes a `command` object as an input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the command matches a specific pattern.

The failing test `test_not_match` calls the `match` function with a `Command` object having a `script` attribute set to `'git'` and a `stderr` attribute set to a string containing Git stash usage information. The test expects the `match` function to return `False`, but it raises an `IndexError` instead.

**Potential error locations**

The error occurs when accessing `command.script.split()[1]`, which suggests that the `split()` method returns an empty list or a list with only one element, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element (index 1).

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script.split()` will always return a list with at least two elements. However, in this case, `command.script` is set to `'git'`, which, when split, returns a list containing only one element: `['git']`. Thus, when trying to access the second element (index 1), an `IndexError` is raised.

**Fixing strategy**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `match` function can handle cases where `command.script` is a single word (e.g., `'git'`). We can do this by checking the length of the split list before trying to access its elements.

**Corrected version**

Here's the corrected `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing its elements, we avoid the `IndexError`. The `match` function now correctly returns `False` for the failing test.
