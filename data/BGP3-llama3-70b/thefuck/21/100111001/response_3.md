Let's analyze the buggy function and identify the potential error locations.

**Buggy Function:**
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

**Error Message:**
`IndexError: list index out of range`

**Cause of the Bug:**
The error occurs when `command.script.split()[1]` is executed. This happens because `command.script` is `'git'`, and when split by whitespace, it becomes a list with only one element `['git']`. Therefore, when trying to access the second element `command.script.split()[1]`, it raises an `IndexError` because the list only has one element.

**Failing Test:**
```python
def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```
The test fails because the `match` function returns an `IndexError` exception when trying to execute the buggy line.

**Potential Error Locations:**

1. `command.script.split()[1]`: This line is the source of the error.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we're not trying to access an index that doesn't exist in the list. We can do this by checking the length of the list before trying to access the second element.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into a list `script_parts`. Then, we check if the list has more than one element using `len(script_parts) > 1`. If it does, we can safely access the second element `script_parts[1]`. This ensures that we don't try to access an index that doesn't exist, avoiding the `IndexError`.
