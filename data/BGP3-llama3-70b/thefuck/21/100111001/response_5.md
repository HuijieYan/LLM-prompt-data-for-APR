The buggy function is trying to match a git command with the `stash` subcommand. It's checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the error is occurring because the `command.script.split()` list has only one element, which is 'git', and therefore, trying to access the second element with `command.script.split()[1]` raises an `IndexError`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Explanation:

1. The `command.script.split()` list is stored in the `words` variable.
2. The function checks if the length of `words` is more than 1 to avoid the `IndexError`.
3. If the length is more than 1, it checks if the second word (`words[1]`) is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test.
