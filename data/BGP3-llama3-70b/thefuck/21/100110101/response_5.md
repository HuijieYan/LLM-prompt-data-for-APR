Here's the analysis and corrected version of the buggy function:

**Analysis**

The buggy function is `match` in `git_fix_stash.py`, which checks if a Git command is a stash command with an error message. The function is decorated with `git_support` from `thefuck.specific.git`.

The test that fails is `test_not_match` in `test_git_fix_stash.py`, which checks that the `match` function returns `False` when given a command with an error message that is not related to stash.

The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`. This suggests that the `command.script` is not split into at least two elements, causing the indexing error.

**Potential error locations**

1. `command.script.split()[1]` assumes that the script is always at least two elements long, which is not the case when the command is simply `git`.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` will always have at least two elements after splitting, which is not the case when the command is simply `git`. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element (`[1]`).

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we don't try to access an index that is out of range. We can do this by checking the length of the split script before trying to access the second element.

**Corrected version**

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we split the `command.script` into `script_parts` and check if it has at least two elements using `len(script_parts) > 1`. If it does, we then check if the second element is `'stash'` and if the error message contains `'usage:'`.
