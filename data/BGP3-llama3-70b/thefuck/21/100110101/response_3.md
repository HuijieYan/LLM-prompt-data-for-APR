Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 0 and script_parts[0] == 'git' and len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the fix:

1. **Analysis**: The buggy function is `match` in `git_fix_stash.py`, which is supposed to match a specific git command. The test function `test_not_match` in `test_git_fix_stash.py` fails with an `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

2. **Error Location**: The error occurs when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`, which implies that the `split()` method returns a list with fewer than two elements.

3. **Bug Cause**: The bug is caused by the incorrect assumption that `command.script.split()` always returns a list with at least two elements. When `command.script` is `'git'`, `split()` returns a list with only one element, leading to the `IndexError`.

4. **Fix Strategy**: To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we don't try to access `script_parts[1]` if the list has fewer than two elements. We can do this by checking the length of the list before accessing its elements.

5. **Corrected Version**: The corrected version of the `match` function checks the length of `script_parts` before accessing its elements. It also ensures that the first element of `script_parts` is `'git'` and the second element is `'stash'` to match the specific git command.
