Here's the analysis and fix for the buggy function:

**1. Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is decorated with `git_support`, which suggests that it's related to Git commands. The function takes a `command` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the command matches a specific condition.

The test function `test_not_match` fails with an `IndexError: list index out of range` error, suggesting that the issue lies in the indexing of the `command.script.split()` list.

**2. Identifying potential error locations**

The potential error location is in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. Specifically, the indexing of `command.script.split()` is suspicious.

**3. Cause of the bug**

The bug occurs because `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, `['git']`, since the script is simply `'git'`. Then, when the code tries to access the second element of the list (`[1]`), it raises an `IndexError` because the list has only one element.

**4. Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we're not trying to access an index that's out of range. We can do this by checking the length of the `command.script.split()` list before trying to access its elements.

**5. Corrected version**

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into a list of parts using `split()`. Then, we check if the length of the list is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element (`script_parts[1]`). This ensures that we don't attempt to access an index that's out of range, preventing the `IndexError`.
