This bug occurs when the input command's script is just "git" (as shown in the error message and the GitHub issue), and the function tries to access the second element of the split script (i.e., `command.script.split()[1]`). 

When the input command's script is just "git", `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, namely "git". Therefore, trying to access the second element (`command.script.split()[1]`) raises an IndexError because the list index is out of range.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
This function will first split the script into parts. Then it checks if there are more than one part (to avoid the IndexError) and if the second part is 'stash', and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. If all these conditions are met, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.
