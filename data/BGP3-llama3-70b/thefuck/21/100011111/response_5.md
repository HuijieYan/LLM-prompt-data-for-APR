The bug in the provided function is that it assumes that `command.script.split()[1]` will always exist, but in cases where the input command is just 'git' (without any arguments), this will result in an `IndexError` because `command.script.split()` will be a list with only one element.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the bug:

1. Analyze the buggy function: The function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.
2. Identify potential error locations: The error is likely to occur in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`.
3. Explain the cause of the bug: The bug occurs because the function doesn't check if the command script has at least two words before trying to access the second word.
4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug: The strategy is to add a check to ensure that the command script has at least two words before trying to access the second word.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected function will first split the command script into parts and then check if there are more than one part. If there are, it will check if the second part is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. If all conditions are met, it will return True; otherwise, it will return False.
