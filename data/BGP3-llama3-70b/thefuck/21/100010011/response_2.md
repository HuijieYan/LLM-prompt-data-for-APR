The buggy function is trying to access the second element of a list (`command.script.split()[1]`) without checking if the list has at least two elements. This is causing an `IndexError` when the `command.script` is just "git" without any arguments.

The issue arises because the `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element ("git") when the input command is simply "git". Then, when the function tries to access the second element of this list (`command.script.split()[1]`), it raises an `IndexError` because the list index is out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can do this by checking the length of the list before accessing its elements.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into parts using the `split()` method. Then, we check if the resulting list has at least two elements using the `len()` function. If it does, we check if the second element is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. If all these conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This way, we avoid the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works correctly even when the input command is just "git".
