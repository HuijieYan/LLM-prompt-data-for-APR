The provided buggy function is:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This function is supposed to match a certain condition, which seems to be a Git stash command. It takes a `command` object as an argument and checks if the second word in the script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the standard error.

The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError: list index out of range` error, which means the script is split into a list, but the index 1 is out of range. This could be because the script is just 'git' and does not have a second word.

The GitHub issue is describing the same problem, where the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just 'git'.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the script is just 'git' and does not have a second word.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to add a check to make sure the script is split into at least two words before trying to access the second word.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version first splits the script into words and then checks if the list of words has more than one element before trying to access the second word.
