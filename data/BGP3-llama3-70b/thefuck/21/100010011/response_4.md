Let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the corresponding error message and the GitHub issue.

The buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The error message from the failing test:

```
IndexError: list index out of range
```

The GitHub issue:

```
git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git
```

The issue description suggests that the rule fails when the script is just `git`, without any arguments.

**Potential error locations:**

1. `command.script.split()[1]`: This line assumes that the script always has at least two elements after splitting by whitespace. However, if the script is just `git`, the split result will be `['git']`, and accessing the second element (`[1]`) will raise an `IndexError`.

**Cause of the bug:**

The bug is caused by the assumption that the script always has at least two elements after splitting by whitespace. When the script is just `git`, the function fails to handle this case, leading to an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the script is just `git`, without any arguments. We can do this by checking the length of the split result before accessing the second element.

**Corrected version:**

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, we first split the script into parts using `command.script.split()`. We then check if the length of the parts is greater than 1 before accessing the second element (`script_parts[1]`). This ensures that we don't raise an `IndexError` when the script is just `git`.
