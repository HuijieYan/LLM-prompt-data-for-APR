Let's break down the bug and provide a corrected version.

**1. Analysis and error message**
The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`. This suggests that `command.script.split()` returns a list with fewer than two elements.

**2. Potential error locations**
The error is likely located in the `match` function, specifically in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`.

**3. Cause of the bug**
The bug occurs when the `command.script` is just `git`, without any arguments. In this case, `command.script.split()` returns a list with a single element, `['git']`. When trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`, it raises an `IndexError` because the list index is out of range.

**4. Strategy for fixing the bug**
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we don't try to access an index that might be out of range. One way to do this is to check the length of the `command.script.split()` list before trying to access its elements.

**5. Corrected version**
Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into a list of parts using `command.script.split()`. We then check if the length of the list is greater than 1 using `len(script_parts) > 1`. If it is, we proceed to check if the second element of the list is equal to `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`. This ensures that we don't try to access an index that might be out of range, preventing the `IndexError`.

With this corrected version, the `match` function should no longer raise an `IndexError` when the `command.script` is just `git`, and it should correctly match the command when the script is `git stash`.
