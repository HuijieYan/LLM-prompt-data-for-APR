The bug in the given function is that it assumes that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split by spaces. However, in the failing test, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which results in a list with only one element when split by spaces. Therefore, when the function tries to access the second element (`command.script.split()[1]`), it raises an `IndexError` because there is no second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 0 and (script_parts[0] == 'git' and (len(script_parts) == 1 or script_parts[1] == 'stash')) and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version first splits the `command.script` into parts. Then it checks if the first part is `'git'` and if there is at least one more part or if the length of `script_parts` is 1 (in case the command is just `'git'`). This way, the function will return `True` if the command is `'git stash'` or just `'git'` and there is a `usage:` message in the `command.stderr`, and `False` otherwise.

This corrected version should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
