Here is the analysis and correction of the buggy function:

**Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with corresponding error message, the runtime input/output values.**

The buggy function is `match` which takes a `command` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the command matches a specific pattern. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` when accessing `command.script.split()[1]`.

**Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.**

The potential error location is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. Specifically, the error occurs when accessing `command.script.split()[1]`.

**Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the runtime input/output variable values.**

The bug occurs because `command.script` is a string containing only one word, `'git'`. When we split this string using `command.script.split()`, the resulting list contains only one element, `['git']`. Therefore, when we try to access `command.script.split()[1]`, it raises an `IndexError` because the list has only one element and we are trying to access the second element (index 1).

**Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we don't access an out-of-range index when splitting `command.script`. We can do this by checking the length of the split list before accessing its elements.

**Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version.**

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```
In this corrected version, we first split `command.script` into `script_parts`. We then check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before accessing `script_parts[1]`. This ensures that we don't raise an `IndexError` when the list has only one element. Finally, we return `True` if all conditions are met, and `False` otherwise.
