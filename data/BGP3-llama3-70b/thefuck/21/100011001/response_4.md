The buggy function is a decorator `@git_support` that matches a `git` command with a specific error message. The error occurs when the function tries to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list, which is out of range.

**Analysis**:

1. The buggy function: `match` takes a `command` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the command matches a specific pattern.
2. The error message: `IndexError: list index out of range` suggests that the function is trying to access an element in the list that does not exist.
3. Runtime values and types: In Case 1, `command.script` is `'git'`, and `command.stderr` contains the error message.

**Potential error locations**:

1. `command.script.split()[1]` - This line of code is trying to access the second element of the split `command.script` list. If the list has only one element, this will raise an `IndexError`.

**Cause of the bug**:

The bug occurs because the `command.script` string is split into a list using the `split()` method, which splits on whitespace characters. If the `command.script` string is only `'git'`, the resulting list will have only one element, and attempting to access the second element (`[1]`) will raise an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**:

1. Check if the `command.script` list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.
2. Handle the case where `command.script` is only `'git'` and return a default value or throw an exception.

**Corrected version**:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` string into a list using `split()`. We then check if the list has at least two elements using `len(script_parts) > 1`. If it does, we access the second element (`script_parts[1]`) and check if it equals `'stash'`. Finally, we check if the `command.stderr` string contains the `'usage:'` substring. If all conditions are true, the function returns `True`.
