Here is the analysis and corrected version of the buggy function:

**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `match` takes a `command` object as input and checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'.

2. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` exception, which means that the `command.script.split()` list has only one element, and trying to access the second element (index 1) is causing the error.

**Potential error locations:**

1. The line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`.

**Cause of the bug:**

The bug is caused by the assumption that the `command.script` always has at least two words, which is not true. In the failing test, the `command.script` is simply 'git', which has only one word.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script` has only one word. We can do this by checking the length of the `command.script.split()` list before trying to access its elements.

**Corrected version:**

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into a list of words using `split()`. Then, we check if the length of the list is greater than 1 before trying to access its elements. If the length is greater than 1, we check if the second word is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'.
