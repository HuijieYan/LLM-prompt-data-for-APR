Let's break down the problem and fix the buggy function.

**Analysis**

The buggy function is `match` in `git_fix_stash.py`, which is a rule for the `thefuck` project. The function takes a `Command` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the command matches a specific pattern.

The test function `test_not_match` in `test_git_fix_stash.py` fails when the input command is simply `git` with a specific error message in the `stderr`.

**Potential error locations**

1. `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`: This line assumes that the script has at least two elements after splitting by spaces. If the script is just `git`, this will raise an `IndexError`.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug occurs because the `match` function assumes that the script always has at least two elements after splitting by spaces. When the input command is simply `git`, the `script.split()` returns a list with only one element, causing the `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the script has at least two elements after splitting by spaces before accessing the second element.

**Corrected version**

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split the script into parts using the `split()` method. Then, we check if the resulting list has at least two elements using the `len()` function. If it does, we access the second element and check if it's equal to `'stash'`. Finally, we check if the `stderr` contains the `'usage:'` string. If all conditions are true, the function returns `True`.
