A nice bug to fix! ðŸ˜Š

Let's break down the problem:

**Analysis**:

The buggy function is `match` in `git_fix_stash.py`, which is supposed to return `True` if the input command is a Git stash command with an error message indicating incorrect usage. The test `test_not_match` in `test_git_fix_stash.py` fails when the input command is simply `git` with no arguments.

**Error Location**:

The error occurs in the `match` function when it tries to access `command.script.split()[1]`, which raises an `IndexError` because the list is empty. This happens when the input command is just `git`, without any arguments.

**Cause of the Bug**:

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script.split()` will always have at least two elements, which is not true when the command is just `git`. The function does not handle this edge case correctly.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function does not raise an `IndexError` when the command is just `git`. We can do this by checking the length of the `command.script.split()` list before trying to access its elements.

**Corrected Version**:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
Here, we first split the command script into parts using `split()`. Then, we check if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1 before trying to access its elements. If the command is just `git`, the list will be empty, and the function will return `False` without raising an error.

With this corrected version, the `test_not_match` test should pass, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
