Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Now let's go through the steps:

**1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with test code, the GitHub issue.**

The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if a Git command is a `stash` command and if it has a `usage:` message in the stderr. The test function `test_not_match` is checking if the function returns `False` when the command is just `git` (without any arguments). The GitHub issue indicates that the function fails when the script is just `git`.

**2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.**

The error location is the `command.script.split()[1]` expression, which assumes that the command script always has at least two parts.

**3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test, the GitHub Issue information.**

The bug is caused by the `IndexError: list index out of range` exception, which occurs when the `command.script` is just `git` (without any arguments). In this case, `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, and trying to access the second element (`[1]`) raises an `IndexError`.

**4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.**

The strategy is to check if the `command.script.split()` list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

**5. Given the buggy function, provide a corrected version.**

The corrected version is shown above. It checks if the `command.script.split()` list has at least two elements (`len(parts) > 1`) before trying to access the second element (`parts[1]`). This should fix the `IndexError` exception and make the function pass the `test_not_match` test.
