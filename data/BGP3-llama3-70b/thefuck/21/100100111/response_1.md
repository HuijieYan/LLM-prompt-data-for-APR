The buggy function `match(command)` is attempting to match a `git` command with a `stash` subcommand. However, it fails when the `git` command is called without any subcommand, resulting in an `IndexError`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
Explanation:

1. The original function was trying to access the second element of the split `command.script` (`command.script.split()[1]`) and check if it's equal to `'stash'`. However, when the `git` command is called without any subcommand, the `split()` result is a list with only one element (`['git']`), causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.
2. Instead, we can check if the string `'stash'` is present in the split `command.script` using the `in` operator. This way, we don't need to worry about the index of the list.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
