I'll guide you through the process of fixing the buggy function.

**1. Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is part of the `git_fix_stash` rule in `thefuck`'s Git support. It's designed to check if the input `command` matches a specific pattern. The function is decorated with `@git_support`, which suggests it's specific to Git commands.

The failing test `test_not_match` passes a `Command` object with a script `git` and a specific error message in `stderr`. The test expects the `match` function to return `False`.

**2. Identifying potential error locations**

The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` exception, which suggests that the issue lies in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This line splits the `command.script` string into a list using whitespace as a separator and then tries to access the second element (`[1]`) of the resulting list.

**3. Cause of the bug**

The bug occurs because the `command.script` string is just `'git'`, which, when split, results in a list containing only one element: `['git']`. Therefore, trying to access the second element (`[1]`) of this list raises an `IndexError`.

**4. Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code handles the case where `command.script` is a single word, like `'git'`. We can do this by checking the length of the split list before trying to access its elements.

**5. Corrected version of the buggy function**

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` string into a list using whitespace as a separator. Then, we check if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1 before trying to access its second element. This ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` exception.
