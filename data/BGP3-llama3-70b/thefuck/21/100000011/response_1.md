The buggy function provided is `match` in `git_fix_stash.py`:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

**Analysis and Error Location**

The function `match` checks if the script command is `git stash` and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the function assumes that `command.script.split()` will always have at least two elements, which is not the case when the script command is simply `git` without any arguments.

**Cause of the Bug**

The bug occurs when the `command.script` is only `git` without any arguments. In this case, `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, which is `git`. When the function tries to access the second element (`command.script.split()[1]`) to check if it's equal to `stash`, it raises an `IndexError` because the list has only one element.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle the case when the script command is just `git` without any arguments. One way to do this is to check the length of the list returned by `command.script.split()` before trying to access its elements.

**Corrected Version**

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, we first split the script command into parts using `command.script.split()`. Then, we check if the length of the parts list is greater than 1 before trying to access its elements. If the length is greater than 1, we check if the second element is `stash` and if 'usage:' is in the error message. If all conditions are true, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
