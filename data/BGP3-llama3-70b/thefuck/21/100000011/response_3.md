Let's break down the issue and provide a corrected version of the buggy function.

**Analysis and Error Location**

The buggy function is `match` in `git_fix_stash.py`, which is part of the `thefuck` project. The GitHub issue describes a scenario where the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just `git`.

The error occurs in the `match` function, specifically at `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. The error message is `IndexError: list index out of range`, indicating that the `split()` function returns a list with fewer than two elements.

**Cause of the Bug**

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script.split()` will always have at least two elements. However, when the script is just `git`, `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, namely `['git']`. Therefore, trying to access the second element (`[1]`) raises an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we don't try to access the second element of the list if it doesn't exist. We can do this by checking the length of the list before attempting to access its elements.

**Corrected Version**

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into a list of parts using `split()`. We then check if the length of the list is greater than 1 using `len(script_parts) > 1`. If it is, we can safely access the second element (`script_parts[1]`) and check if it's equal to `'stash'`. Finally, we also check if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr` as required by the original implementation.
