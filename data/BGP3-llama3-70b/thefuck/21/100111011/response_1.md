Here's the analysis and fix for the buggy function:

**Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is expected to return `True` if the command is `git stash` and the error message contains `usage:`, but it fails when the script is just `git`.

The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the `split()` method returns a list with only one element, and trying to access the second element (`[1]`) raises an error.

The test function `test_not_match` fails because it expects the `match` function to return `False` when the command is just `git`, but it returns an `IndexError` instead.

**Identification of potential error locations**

The potential error location is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script.split()` will always return a list with at least two elements. However, when the command is just `git`, the list only contains one element (`['git']`), and trying to access the second element raises an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `split()` method returns a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can do this by checking the length of the list before accessing its elements.

**Corrected version**

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
This version first splits the `command.script` into a list of parts using `split()`. Then, it checks if the list has more than one element using `len(script_parts) > 1`. If it does, it checks if the second element is `'stash'` and if the error message contains `usage:`. If all conditions are true, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

With this corrected version, the `test_not_match` test should pass, and the `git_fix_stash` rule should work correctly.
