To fix the buggy function, we need to handle the case where `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, which is 'git'. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

The bug in the original function occurred because it didn't handle the case where `script_parts` had only one element. When `command.script` is 'git', `script_parts` is `['git']`, so `script_parts[1]` raises an `IndexError` because it's out of range. 

The corrected function checks if `script_parts` has more than one element before trying to access `script_parts[1]`. If `script_parts` has only one element, `len(script_parts) > 1` is `False`, so the function returns `False` without trying to access `script_parts[1]`.
