Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Let me explain the bug, the error, and the fix:

**Bug Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is supposed to match Git stash commands. It checks if the second part of the command script is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'.

**Error Message**

The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the script is trying to access an index in the `command.script.split()` list that doesn't exist.

**Runtime Values and Types**

In Case 1, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which means `command.script.split()` will return a list with only one element, `['git']`. When the function tries to access `script_parts[1]`, it raises an `IndexError` because the list only has one element, and the index 1 is out of range.

**GitHub Issue**

The GitHub issue describes the problem: the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just `'git'`.

**Fix**

The fix is to check if the `script_parts` list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This is done by adding the condition `len(script_parts) > 1` to the `return` statement.

With this fix, the `match` function will correctly handle cases where the script is just `'git'`, and it will not raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the `script_parts` list.
