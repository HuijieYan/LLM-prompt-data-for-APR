Let's analyze the buggy function and identify the potential error locations.

**Function Analysis**

The buggy function `match` takes a `command` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the command matches a specific pattern. The function appears to be checking if the command is a Git stash command and if thestderr output contains the string "usage:".

**Potential Error Locations**

1. `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`: This line assumes that the script is always a string with at least two parts separated by a space. If the script is empty or only has one part, this line will raise an `IndexError`.
2. `'usage:' in command.stderr`: This line assumes that `command.stderr` is a string. If `command.stderr` is not a string or is None, this line will raise a `TypeError`.

**Cause of the Bug**

The bug is likely caused by the fact that `command.script` is not always a string with at least two parts separated by a space. In Case 1, `command.script` is simply `'git'`, which means that `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` is properly handled when it's not a string with at least two parts separated by a space. We can do this by adding a simple check before attempting to access the second part of the script.

**Corrected Version**

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into parts using the `split()` method. We then check if the resulting list has at least two elements using the `len()` function. If it does, we proceed to check if the second element is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. This ensures that we don't raise an `IndexError` when `command.script` is not a string with at least two parts separated by a space.
