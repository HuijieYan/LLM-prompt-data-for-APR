The buggy function is supposed to check if the Git command is `stash` and if there's a `usage:` string in the standard error output. However, the current implementation is not correctly evaluating the command script.

The issue lies in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This is because `command.script` is just the command `git` and not the full command with arguments. To fix this, we need to check if `stash` is in the command script.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Explanation:

* The original function was trying to check if the second word in the command script is `stash`, but it's not guaranteed that the command script always has a space-separated format. Instead, we can simply check if `stash` is present in the command script using the `in` operator.
* The rest of the logic remains the same: we also need to check if there's a `usage:` string in the standard error output.

With this corrected function, it should correctly identify Git commands that have `stash` as an argument and have a `usage:` string in the standard error output.
