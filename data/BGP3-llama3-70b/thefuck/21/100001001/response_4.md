The buggy function is supposed to match a specific condition for a Git command, but it has a bug that prevents it from working correctly.

**Analysis and identification of potential error locations:**

The function `match` takes a `command` object as input and checks if the script of the command is `git stash` and if the error message contains `usage:`. The potential error locations are:

1. `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`: This line assumes that the script is split into two parts, and the second part is `stash`. However, what if the script is just `git stash` without any options?

**Cause of the bug:**

The bug occurs when the script is `git` instead of `git stash`. In this case, `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` because the split result is a list with only one element.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script is indeed `git stash` before checking the error message. We can do this by checking the length of the split result and comparing the entire script with `git stash`.

**Corrected version:**
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[0] == 'git' and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
This corrected version first splits the script into parts using `split()`. Then, it checks if the length of the split result is more than 1 (to avoid `IndexError`), and compares the first part with `git` and the second part with `stash`. Finally, it checks if the error message contains `usage:`. Only if all these conditions are true, the function returns `True`.
