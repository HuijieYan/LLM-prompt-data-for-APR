The following is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth!= self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

Explanation of the bug and the fix:
The bug in the original code was in the line `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not is_import(current_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:`. It should be `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:`. The function `is_import` was being called with `current_line` as an argument, but it should be checking the `is_import` attribute of `current_line`.

I also did not see any other bugs or potential errors in the function. The logic of the function seems to be correct and it should work as expected.
