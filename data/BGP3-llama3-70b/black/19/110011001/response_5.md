The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This function determines the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

The bug in this function is that it does not correctly handle the case when the current line is a decorator or a definition, and the previous line is also a decorator. In this case, the function should not insert empty lines between the decorators, but it does.

The correction of this function is shown below:

```Python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator and is_decorator:
            return 0, 0  # Do not insert empty lines between decorators
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth!= self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected function, an additional check is added to return `(0, 0)` when the current line is a decorator and the previous line is also a decorator. This ensures that no empty lines are inserted between decorators.
