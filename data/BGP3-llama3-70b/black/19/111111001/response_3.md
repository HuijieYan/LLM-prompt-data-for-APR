The issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in its logic for handling decorators and `def` statements. Specifically, it doesn't correctly handle the case when a decorator is followed by another decorator or a `def` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    else:
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth!= self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

The main change is in the logic for handling decorators and `def` statements. If the current line is a decorator or a `def` statement, it will always insert at least one newline if the previous line is not a decorator, and it will not insert a newline if the previous line is a decorator. This ensures that there is always a blank line between two consecutive decorators or between a decorator and a `def` statement.
