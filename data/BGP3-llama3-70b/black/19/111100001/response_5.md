The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on its depth, type, and surrounding context.

After analyzing the code, I identified a potential error location:
```python
while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
    self.previous_defs.pop()
    before = 1 if depth else 2
```
The issue is that the `before` variable is being reassigned in each iteration of the while loop, but its value is not being accumulated. As a result, only the last assignment to `before` is retained.

The cause of the bug is that the `before` variable should be incremented by 1 or 2 based on the `depth` value, but instead, it is being overwritten.

To fix the bug, I suggest the following strategy:

1. Initialize `before` to 0 before the while loop.
2. Inside the loop, increment `before` by 1 or 2 based on the `depth` value, instead of reassigning it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    extra_before = 0
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        extra_before += 1 if depth else 2
    before += extra_before
    #... (rest of the function remains the same)
```
With this fix, the `before` variable should accumulate the correct number of empty lines needed before the current line.
