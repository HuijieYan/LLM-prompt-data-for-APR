The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have several logical issues. 

1. The variable `max_allowed` is not being used properly. It is set to 1 or 2 based on the `depth` of the `current_line`, but its value is not being used in the logic that follows.

2. The `before` variable is being calculated based on the prefix of the first leaf of `current_line`, but it is not being used in the return statement.

3. The logic for inserting empty lines between decorators, definitions, and classes is not correct. It does not consider the case where a decorator or a definition/class is followed by another decorator or definition/class.

4. The function does not handle the case where a flow control statement is followed by a definition or a class.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or self.previous_line.is_def or self.previous_line.is_class:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            newlines = before or 1
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth!= self.previous_line.depth):
            newlines = before or 1
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    else:
        return before, 0
```

This version of the function correctly handles the insertion of empty lines based on the type of the current line and the previous line.
