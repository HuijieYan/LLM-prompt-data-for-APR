The provided buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is used to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after a given line.

The bug in the function is in the line `first_leaf.prefix = ""`. This line resets the prefix of the first leaf to an empty string, which can cause subsequent calls to `maybe_empty_lines` to lose information about the newlines in the prefix of the first leaf.

The error message from the failing test suggests that the bug is causing the generated code to have extra empty lines. This is because the `maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly counting the newlines in the prefix of the first leaf, leading to incorrect decisions about where to insert empty lines.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly count the newlines in the prefix of the first leaf. We can do this by creating a copy of the prefix, counting the newlines in the copy, and then resetting the copy, rather than modifying the original prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        prefix_copy = first_leaf.prefix  # Create a copy of the prefix
        before = prefix_copy.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        # Don't modify the original prefix
    else:
        before = 0
   ...
```
With this corrected version, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should correctly count the newlines in the prefix of the first leaf, and the failing test should pass.
