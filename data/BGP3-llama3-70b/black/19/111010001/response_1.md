After analyzing the buggy function and the error message, I have identified the potential error locations and the cause of the bug.

**Potential error locations:**

1. The `before` variable calculation in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method.
2. The conditional statements that return `before` and `newlines` values.

**Cause of the bug:**

The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation of the `before` variable, which affects the number of empty lines inserted before and after the current line. The `before` variable is calculated based on the prefix of the first leaf, but it is not correctly updated when consuming the extra newlines.

The error message indicates that the actual output has extra empty lines inserted, which is not expected according to the test case.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

1. Review the logic of calculating the `before` variable and ensure it is correctly updated when consuming extra newlines.
2. Check the conditional statements that return `before` and `newlines` values to ensure they are correct and consistent with the expected behavior.

**Corrected version:**
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.lstrip("\n")  # Fix: remove consumed newlines
    else:
        before = 0
   ...
```
I added the `first_leaf.prefix.lstrip("\n")` line to remove the consumed newlines from the prefix, ensuring that the `before` variable is correctly calculated.

Please note that this is a potential fix, and you may need to test it thoroughly to ensure it passes all test cases.
