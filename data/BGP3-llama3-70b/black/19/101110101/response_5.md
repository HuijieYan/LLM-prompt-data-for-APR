To fix the buggy function, I need to correct the logic of empty line insertion. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several conditions to check if an empty line should be inserted before the current line. However, the logic of these conditions is not correct, leading to incorrect empty line insertion.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth!= self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

The main changes are:
- Corrected the conditions for inserting empty lines before decorators, definitions, and classes.
- Fixed the logic for inserting empty lines after flow control statements.
- Corrected the conditions for inserting empty lines after imports and yields.
- Made sure that the `previous_defs` list is correctly updated.

This corrected function should pass all the test cases and produce the expected output.
