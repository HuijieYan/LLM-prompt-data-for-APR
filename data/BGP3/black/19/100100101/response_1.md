The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to identifying the potential error location within the buggy function.

After analyzing the buggy function, the potential error location is the part where the function is consuming the extra newlines from the first leaf.

The test provided seems to cover a specific scenario where a decorator is expected to be processed. The function is failing to handle the case when the current line is a comment.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```Python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
    before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
    before = min(before, max_allowed)
    first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if not self.previous_line or not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            before = 0
        return before, 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth!= self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The main change is the addition of a check to see if the previous line is a decorator before processing the current line as a decorator. If the previous line is a decorator, the function returns 0 for the number of newlines.

The function should now pass the failing test.
