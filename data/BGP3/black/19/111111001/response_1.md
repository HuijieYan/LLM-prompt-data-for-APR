**Analysis**

The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` belongs to the `EmptyLineTracker` class. Its purpose is to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function iterates through several cases based on the input parameters and previous definitions.

The main issue with this function is that it has a logical error in its implementation. The function does not correctly handle the case where the current line is a decorator, and the previous line is also a decorator. In this case, the function should not insert any extra empty lines before the current line.

**Error Location**

The error is located in the following lines:
```python
if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
    return 0, 0
```
This condition is not sufficient to handle all cases where the previous line is a decorator. Specifically, if the current line is also a decorator, this condition will not prevent extra empty lines from being inserted.

**Cause of the Bug**

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the case where the previous line is a decorator, and the current line is also a decorator. The function assumes that the previous line being a decorator means that no extra empty lines are needed before the current line. However, this is not always the case, especially when the current line is also a decorator.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks if the previous line is a decorator. We should also add a check to see if the current line is a decorator, and if so, return 0, 0 immediately, indicating that no extra empty lines are needed.

**Corrected Version**
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
   ...
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0  # no extra empty lines needed when both lines are decorators
   ...
```
With this change, the function correctly handles the case where both the previous and current lines are decorators, and prevents extra empty lines from being inserted.
