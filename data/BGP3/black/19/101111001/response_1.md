The bug is in the logic of the `maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is intended to add new lines before a line that is not a definition, but it is not considering the case where the previous line is an import statement.

In the failing test, the expected output has an extra new line before the decorator line, which is not present in the actual output. This suggests that the function is not adding an extra new line when the previous line is an import statement.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to add an extra new line when the previous line is an import statement. We can do this by adding a condition to check if the previous line is an import statement and if so, add an extra new line.

Here is the corrected code:
```
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
   ...
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        newlines = 2
    else:
        newlines = 1
   ...
```
With this change, the function should correctly add an extra new line before the decorator line in the failing test, producing the expected output.
