After analyzing the buggy function and the related functions, test code, corresponding error message, and runtime input/output values, it is clear that the bug is related to the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. 

When a decorator is encountered, the function should not insert empty lines before and after the decorator. However, it is currently inserting an empty line after the decorator. This is causing the test case to fail.

The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the case where a decorator is encountered.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I removed the line `return newlines, 0` which was causing the problem. Now, when a decorator is encountered, the function will return `(before, 0)` without inserting an empty line after the decorator.
