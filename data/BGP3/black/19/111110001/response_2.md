The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is trying to track the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, the logic is incorrect and leads to unexpected results.

Given the error message from the failing test, it seems that the buggy function is not correctly handling the case when there is a comment in a decorator.

**Identifying the potential error locations:**

1. The line `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:` is suspect because it suggests that the previous line is a decorator, but it doesn't check if the current line is also a decorator.

**Explaining the cause of the bug:**

The bug is likely due to the fact that the logic for handling decorators is not correct. Specifically, when a decorator is encountered, the function needs to check if the previous line is also a decorator and adjust the number of empty lines accordingly. However, the current implementation doesn't do this correctly.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

1. Revise the logic for handling decorators to correctly check if the previous line is also a decorator.
2. Adjust the number of empty lines based on this check.

**Corrected version of the buggy function:**

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
   ...
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # If the previous line is a decorator, don't insert extra empty lines.
        return 0, 0
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
       ...
```

In this corrected version, we check if the previous line is a decorator and return 0, 0 if it is, indicating no extra empty lines are needed. Then, we continue with the rest of the logic as before.

With this corrected version, the test `test_comment_in_decorator` should pass without any errors.
