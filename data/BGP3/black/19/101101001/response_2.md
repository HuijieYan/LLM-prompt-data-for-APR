The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `black.py` file. Based on the provided test case `test_comment_in_decorator` in the `test_black.py` file, I identified the issue.

The problem lies in the fact that the function is not correctly handling the case where `current_line.leaves` is an empty list. This causes `first_leaf` to beinyin undefined, resulting in a `AttributeError` when trying to access `first_leaf.prefix`.

To fix this issue, we can add a simple check to ensure that `first_leaf` is not `None` before attempting to access its `prefix` attribute.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        if first_leaf is not None:  # Add this check
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    #... (rest of the function remains the same)
```
With this correction, the function should no longer throw an `AttributeError` when `current_line.leaves` is an empty list.
