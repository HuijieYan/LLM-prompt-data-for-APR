After analyzing the buggy function and the related functions, I have identified the potential error locations. The errors are primarily related to the logic of adding new lines and the incorrect handling of decorators, imports, and classes.

The buggy function seems to be handling the logic of adding new lines incorrectly, which ultimately leads to incorrect output. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the different cases where it should add new lines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
            if current_line.is_import:
                if depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                    return (before or 1), 0
            elif not current_line.is_import:
                return (before or 1), 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
            if current_line.is_yield and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                return (before or 1), 0
        return (before + 1),$0
    return before, 0
```
This corrected function ensures that the logic of adding new lines is handled correctly, taking into account the different cases for decorators, imports, and classes.
