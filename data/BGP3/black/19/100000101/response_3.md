I've identified the potential error locations within the buggy function. The function is not properly handling the cases where `current_line.is_decorator` is `True` or `current_line.is_def` is `True`. This is because the logic to handle these cases is not properly nested.

Upon analyzing the expected values and types of variables, I've determined that the function should return `0, 0` for `current_line.is_decorator` and `current_line.is_def`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def:
        return 0, 0
    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0
    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    return newlines, 0
```
In the corrected version, I've added a check for `current_line.is_decorator` and `current_line.is_def` before returning the values for `before` and `newlines`. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns `0, 0`. This ensures that the function handles these cases correctly.

The corrected function should now produce the expected output for all the given cases.
