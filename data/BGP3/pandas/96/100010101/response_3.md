The buggy function is intended to apply a `CustomBusinessHour` offset to a datetime. Due to the irregularities in the frequency of the custom business hour, the function needs to handle adjusting for these irregularities to ensure the output datetime is as close as possible to the input datetime.

One of the potential areas for improvement is in handling the adjustment for business days that fall outside the custom business hour. This can be done by creating a new instance of `BusinessDayOffset` that skips the current business day if it falls outside the custom business hour.

Another potential area for improvement is in handling the transition between business hours. The function should check if the previous and next business hours are the same as the current business hour, and if not, adjust the output datetime accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Create a new BusinessDay instance
        new_bd = BusinessDay(n=0)
        # Apply the BusinessDay offset
        other = new_bd._apply(self, other)
        # Check if the result is still within the custom business hour
        while not self._is_on_offset(other):
            # If not, adjust the result to the next occurrence of the custom business hour
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This version of the function creates a new `BusinessDay` instance and applies the `BusinessDay` offset to the input datetime. It then checks if the result is still within the custom business hour and adjusts it if necessary.
