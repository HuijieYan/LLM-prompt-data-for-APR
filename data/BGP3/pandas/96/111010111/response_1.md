To fix the bug in this function, we need to identify the problematic part and modify it to ensure that it correctly handles the date range generation with CustomBusinessHour offset and holidays.

In the given code, the buggy function is `apply()`. It's possible that the problem is with the logic used to adjust the `other` timestamp based on whether it is on or off the business hours.

Here's a proposed solution that overhauls the `apply()` function to correctly handle the date range generation. 

```Python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if n > 0 and not self._is_on_offset(other):
                # adjust to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(microseconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # ensure the adjustment is done correctly
        if n > 0:
            while True:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                if other < bhour:
                    break
                else:
                    other = bhour
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This solution iteratively reduces the business hours adjustment until the specified number of business hours are reached. This ensures that the generated date range stays within the business hours defined by the CustomBusinessHour offset and holidays.

### Additional fixes

1. Handle 'edge case' with modification. Ensure that `bhour_remain` in a roll over from the previous day should still propagate.

   ```Python
   if r > 0:
       other = other - timedelta(minutes=r)
   ```

2. Improve validation of the input. Provide an error message for other input types.

   ```Python
   if not isinstance(other, datetime) and not isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
       raise ValueError("Only datetime and Timestamp are supported")
   ```
