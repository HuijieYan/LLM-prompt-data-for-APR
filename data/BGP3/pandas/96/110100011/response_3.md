To fix the bug, we need to understand the logic of the function and identify the potential error locations. The function `apply` is supposed to take a datetime object and adjust it to the next business hour if it's not on the offset. However, there seems to be an issue when the datetime object is before the business day or after the end of business day.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```Python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        if self并不在 other 中:
            if self.n >= 0:
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that if the datetime object is before the business day or after the end of business day, it is adjusted accordingly.
