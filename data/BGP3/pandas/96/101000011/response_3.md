**Analysis and Bug Identification**

The bug in the `apply` function of `BusinessHourMixin` class is caused by incorrect handling of business hours and holiday dates. When there are holidays, the function is not correctly adjusting the business hours, resulting in extra periods being generated.

The bug can be identified by analyzing the GitHub issue and the code provided. The issue reports that when adding holidays to the `date_range` function, it produces more periods than expected. This suggests that the function is not correctly handling holiday dates.

**Error Location**

The error is located in the `apply` function of `BusinessHourMixin` class. Specifically, the issue arises when the function adjusts the business hours for dates that fall on holidays.

**Cause of the Bug**

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of business hours and holiday dates. When the function encounters a holiday, it does not correctly adjust the business hours, resulting in extra periods being generated.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to correctly handle holiday dates. This can be achieved by adjusting the business hours for dates that fall on holidays.

**Corrected Code**

Here is the corrected code:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        #...
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        #...
        while bhour_remain!= timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if self.is_on_offset(other + bhour):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        #...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
The corrections made include:

1. Added a check to see if the date falls on a holiday and adjust the business hours accordingly.
2. Modified the while loop to correctly adjust the business hours for dates that fall on holidays.

With these corrections, the `apply` function should now correctly handle holiday dates and provide the expected result.
