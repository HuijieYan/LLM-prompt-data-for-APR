Here's my report on the bug:

**Bug Analysis:**
The bug is in the `apply()` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The issue is caused by the way the business hours are calculated when holidays are present. The function is incorrectly adjusting the date range to include business days that are not actually business days.

**Error Location:**
The error is in the following part of the code:

```python
if not self._is_on_offset(other):
    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
```

This code is trying to adjust the date range to include business days that are not actually business days.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of the date range when holidays are present. The function is trying to adjust the date range to include business days that are not actually business days, which is causing the incorrect date range to be generated.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the date range correctly when holidays are present. We need to check if the date is a holiday and adjust the date range accordingly.

**Corrected Version:**
Here is the corrected version of the `apply()` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
       ...
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
       ...
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to see if the next business day is on the offset. If it is, we adjust the date range to include the next business day. Otherwise, we adjust the date range to include the next opening time.

This corrected version should fix the bug and generate the correct date range when holidays are present.
