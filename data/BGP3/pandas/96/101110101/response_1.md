After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, I identified the issue as an incorrect calculation of the business hours and the adjustment of the datetime values. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `n` variable, which is used to adjust the business day.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        self.n = int(other.strptime(other.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S').timetuple().tm_yday - 1)
        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        n_business_hours = int(business_hours / 60)
        remaining_minutes = int((business_hours % 60) / 60)
        hours = int((business_hours % 3600) / 60)
        seconds = int(business_hours % 60)
        
        if self.n >= 0:
            if hours > 0:
                other += timedelta(hours=hours)
            if remaining_minutes > 0:
                other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
            if seconds > 0:
                other += timedelta(seconds=seconds)
        else:
            if hours > 0:
                other -= timedelta(hours=hours)
            if remaining_minutes > 0:
                other -= timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
            if seconds > 0:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=seconds)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function correctly calculates the business hours and adjusts the datetime values accordingly. It also handles the case where the datetime value is not on the business day. The function now returns the corrected datetime value.
