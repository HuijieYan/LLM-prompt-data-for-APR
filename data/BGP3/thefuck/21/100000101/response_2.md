Let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the expected input/output values.

The function `match` checks if a Git command's stderr output contains the string 'usage:' and if the command is a 'stash' command. The command's script is split into a list and the second item in the list is compared with 'stash'.

The bug in the function is that it does not correctly split the command's script into a list. The `split()` function without any arguments splits on whitespace characters, but the command script is not whitespace separated. This means that the `split()` function will split on the first whitespace character it encounters, which is the space between 'git' and 'stash'. Therefore, the second item in the list will not be 'stash', but something else, which is expected to cause the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to split the command's script in a way that it correctly identifies the 'stash' command. One way to do this is to split on the first space character. We can use the `split()` function with one argument, which is the delimiter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split(' ', 1)[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This function uses the `split()` function with one argument, which is the space character. The `[1]` index is used to get the second item in the list, which is the command after the first space character. This should correctly identify the 'stash' command and satisfy the expected input/output values.
