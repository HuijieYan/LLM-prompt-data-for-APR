Analyzing the buggy function, we can identify the potential error location as the `script.split()[1]` line. The bug is likely due to the `script.split()` not producing the expected result, which is a list containing at least two elements, and `script.split()[1]` trying to access the second element without checking if it exists.

Given the expected input/output values, the corrected function would need to correctly identify the `git` command as the first element of the `command.script` and check if the second element (if it exists) is indeed `'stash'`.

Here's the suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Correctly split the `command.script` into a list of elements.
2. Check if the list contains at least two elements.
3. Access the second element (if it exists) and check if it's equal to `'stash'`.

The corrected version of the buggy function is:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```
In this corrected function, we first split the `command.script` into a list of elements using `split()`. Then, we check if the list contains at least two elements using `len(script_parts) >= 2`. If it does, we access the second element using `script_parts[1]` and check if it's equal to `'stash'`. Finally, we also check if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr` to ensure that the `match` function returns a consistent result.
