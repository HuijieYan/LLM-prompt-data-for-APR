The buggy function is supposed to check if the command is 'git stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. 

However, currently, the function is comparing the second word of the command script with 'stash', which is incorrect. The correct way to do it would be to split the command script by space and check the first word.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```
This corrected function splits the command script by space, takes the first element (index 0), and checks if it's 'git'. It also checks if the stderr contains 'usage:'.

According to the given runtime values and types, and the expected values and types of variables, the corrected function will return `True` in Case 1, which is expected.

Here's a summary of the bug and its fix:

* Bug: The buggy function is comparing the second word of the command script with 'stash', which is incorrect. It should split the command script by space, take the first element, and check if it's 'git'.
* Fix: The corrected function splits the command script by space, takes the first element, and checks if it's 'git'. It also checks if the stderr contains 'usage:'.
