The buggy function is `match(command)` in `git_fix_stash.py`. It returns whether the command is 'git stash' and contains 'usage:' in its stderr. The failing test `test_not_match()` in `test_git_fix_stash.py` checks if this function returns False when given a command with 'git stash' and the corresponding stderr. However, the function is returning the opposite of what it should.

Here's the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The potential error location is in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. It seems like the function is splitting the command by spaces, assuming there are at least two elements in the list. If there are less than two elements, the function will raise an IndexError.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrect in its assumption about the command script. It expects the command to be 'git stash', but it does not handle the cases where the command is not 'git stash'.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to properly check the command and its stderr. If the command is 'git stash', then check the stderr. If the command is not 'git stash', return False.

Here's the corrected function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script.startswith('git stash'):
        return True if 'usage:' in command.stderr else False
    return False
```
The corrected function starts by checking if the command script starts with 'git stash'. If it does, then it checks if the stderr contains 'usage:'. If both conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. If the command script does not start with 'git stash', the function returns False.
