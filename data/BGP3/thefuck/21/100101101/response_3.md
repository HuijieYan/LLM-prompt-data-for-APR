**Analysis**

The buggy function is `match` in `git_fix_stash.py`. It returns `True` if the command script contains the string "stash" and its stderr contains the string "usage:". The test case `test_not_match` in `test_git_fix_stash.py` fails because the `match` function returns `False` for a command with stderr containing "usage:".

**Potential error locations**

1. The `split()` method might not be working correctly for some reason.
2. The condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` might not be checking the correct part of the command script.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is that the `split()` method is not working correctly. The `split()` method splits a string into a list using spaces as separators. However, in this case, the `script` attribute of the `command` object contains a multi-line string with spaces and newlines. When `split()` is called on this string, it treats newlines as separators, which means that the resulting list will not contain the expected substring.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to normalize the script string to remove newlines and other non-space characters, and then split it using spaces or some other suitable separator.

**Corrected function**

Here is the corrected `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.replace("\n", " ")
    script_parts = script.split()
    return script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
Explanation:

1. We replace newlines (`\n`) with spaces to normalize the script string.
2. We split the normalized script string using spaces (`split()`).
3. We check if the second element of the split list (`script_parts[1]`) is equal to 'stash'.
4. We ensure that the `command.stderr` contains the string "usage:".

**Expected output**

The corrected `match` function should return `True` for the given test case and pass the `test_not_match` test.

**Additional test cases**

It's recommended to add more test cases to ensure that the corrected function works as expected for different inputs.
