The bug in the function is due to the scenario where the command is simply `git`, without any additional arguments. In this case, `script.split()` will return a list `['git']`, and `split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` because there is no second element in the list.

To fix the function, we should check if the list has a length greater than 1 before trying to access its second element. We can do this by checking `len(script.split()) > 1` before splitting the command at all.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

This function first splits the command into parts, then checks if the list has more than one element and if the second element is 'stash'. It also checks if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. If all these conditions are met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The corrected function will pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
