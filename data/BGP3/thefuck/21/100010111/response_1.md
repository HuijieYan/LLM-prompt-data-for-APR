The bug in the function is that it tries to access the second element of a list (`command.script.split()[1]`) which does not exist. This is because the command is simply `git` and there is no second element in the list returned by `split()`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the list returned by `split()` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected function, `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` has been replaced with `command.script.startswith('git stash')`. This ensures that the function will return True if the command starts with `git stash` and the stderr contains `usage:`, but will not try to access a non-existent second element in the list returned by `split()`.

Another way to fix this bug would be to check if the list returned by `split()` has at least two elements before accessing the second element, like this:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

This version of the function checks if the list returned by `split()` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If the list has only one element, it returns False.
