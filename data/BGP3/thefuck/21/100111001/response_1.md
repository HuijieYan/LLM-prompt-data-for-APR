Based on the provided information, I will analyze the bug, identify the potential error locations, explain the cause of the bug, suggest a strategy for fixing it, and provide a corrected version of the function.

**Analysis of the buggy function and failing test**

The buggy function `match` is decorated with `@git_support` and checks if the script in the `command` object contains the word 'stash' and if the `command.stderr` contains the string 'usage:'.

The failing test `test_not_match` checks if the `match` function returns `False` for a `Command` object with `stderr` containing the usage message of the `git stash` command.

**Potential error locations**

Based on the error message `IndexError: list index out of range` and the runtime values provided, I suspect that the error occurs when trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug occurs because when splitting the `command.script` string, it returns a list containing only one element, which is the string 'git'. Therefore, when trying to access the second element using `command.script.split()[1]`, the function raises an `IndexError` because there is no second element.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script` is correctly parsed to extract the relevant information. Since the `command.script` contains the usage message of the `git stash` command, we can modify the function to extract the first word of the script, which should be 'stash'.

**Corrected version of the function**

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if script_parts:
        if script_parts[0] == 'stash':
            return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
In the corrected version, I added a check to ensure that the `script_parts` list is not empty before trying to access its elements. Then, I checked if the first element of the `script_parts` list is 'stash'. If it is, I returned `True` if 'usage:' is found in the `command.stderr` message, otherwise, I returned `False`.
