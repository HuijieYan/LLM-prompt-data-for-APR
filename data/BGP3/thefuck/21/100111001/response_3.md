Let's go through the issues and resolve the bug.

**Analysis**

The buggy function is supposed to match a command that starts with `git stash` and has `usage:` in the error message. However, the function currently checks if `command.script.split()[1]` equals `'stash'`, which is incorrect.

**Error locations**

1. The error is in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'...)`. This line assumes that `command.script` is split into a list with at least two elements, but this is not guaranteed.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug occurs because the `command.script` is not split correctly. When `command.script.split()` is called, it returns a list of strings, but since the input `command.script` is `'git'`, the splitting results in a list with a single element, i.e., `['git']`. When we try to access the second element (`command.script.split()[1]`), it raises an `IndexError` because the list has only one element.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to check if the first word of the command is `git stash`. We can achieve this by checking if the first word is `git` and if the second word is `stash`.

**Corrected version**

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we use the `startswith` method to check if the `command.script` starts with `git stash`. This is a more robust way to match the command, and it should fix the bug.
