The buggy function is supposed to check if the command is a Git command related to the `stash` feature and if the command has an error message in its output. The function currently checks if the command's script starts with the string "git stash" and has an error message in its output, which is incorrect.

The main issue is that the function is trying to access the list element at index 1 of `command.script.split()` which can lead to an `IndexError` if the list has less than 2 elements. This is because a command can have less than two elements in the list when it is simply "git".

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if the string "stash" is in the command's script and if the error message in the command's output includes the string "usage:". This does not require the command to have a specific structure and should correctly identify Git stash related commands with an error message.
