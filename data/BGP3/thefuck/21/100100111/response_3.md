The buggy function, `match`, is attempting to split the `command.script` into a list and then check the second element of the list (`[1]`) to ensure it is equal to `'stash'`. However, the function fails when the `command.script` does not have enough elements in the list, causing an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_list = command.script.split()
    if len(script_list) >= 2 and script_list[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into a list using the `split` method. Then, we check if the length of the list is at least 2 using the `len` function. If the list has at least two elements, we check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. Finally, we return `True` if the `command.stderr` contains the string `'usage:'`, and `False` otherwise.

With this corrected function, the failing test `test_not_match` should pass, and the `git_fix_stash` rule should work correctly even when the script is just `git`.
