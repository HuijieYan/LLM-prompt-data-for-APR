The issue here is that the function `match` is trying to split the command script with a space and then check if the second element (index 1) is 'stash'. However, when the command script is just 'git', this will cause an `IndexError` because `command.script.split()[1]` will be out of range.

To fix this, we need to make sure that we handle the case where the command script is just 'git' correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```Python
@ git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the command script has more than one element. If it does, we then check if the second element is 'stash'. If both conditions are met, we return `True` if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. Otherwise, we return `False`. This way, we can correctly handle the case where the command script is just 'git'.

The corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
