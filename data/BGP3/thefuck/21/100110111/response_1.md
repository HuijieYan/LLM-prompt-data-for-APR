**Analysis and Solution**

1. **Buggy code**: The function `match` is designed to check if the `git` command's output contains the string 'usage:' and the command's second argument is 'stash'. However, this logic is incorrect because the command's script might not always be 'stash' even if the output contains 'usage:'.

2. **Identified error location**: The error is in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. 

3. **Cause of the bug**: The bug occurs because when the script is simply 'git', [1] will be out of range, resulting in an IndexError.

4. **Strategy for fixing the bug**: We should make sure that the script is 'git stash' before checking if 'usage:' is in the command's output.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'git stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This solution ensures that the command's script must contain 'git stash' before it will return true. It also checks if 'usage:' is in the command's output.
