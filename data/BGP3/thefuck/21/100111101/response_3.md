Let's go through the analysis and fixing of the bug.

**Analysis**

The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if a `git` command is a `stash` command or not. The function takes a `command` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the command is a `stash` command or not.

The function checks if the `script` of the command splits into a list with the first element being `"stash"` and if the `stderr` of the command contains the string `"usage:"`.

However, the bug is that the `script` of the command is simply a string `"git"` and not a list. When we try to split it using `split()[1]`, it raises an `IndexError` because there is no element at index 1 (since the list has only one element).

**Error location**

The error is located in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'...`.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is caused by the assumption that the `script` of the command is a list. However, it is simply a string `"git"`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

We need to modify the function to convert the `script` string to a list and then check if the list contains the string `"stash"`.

**Corrected function**

Here is the corrected function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_list = command.script.split()
    return script_list and script_list[0] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
**Changes made**

1. We split the `script` string into a list using `split()`.
2. We check if the list is not empty using `and script_list[0] == 'stash'`. This is needed because `split()` returns an empty list if the input string is empty.
3. We check if the first element of the list is `"stash"` and if the `stderr` of the command contains the string `"usage:"`.

With these changes, the function should correctly identify whether a `git` command is a `stash` command or not.
