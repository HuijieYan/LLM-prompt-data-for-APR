The bug in the current function lies in the definition of the match command where it is trying to find if the first element in the command.script.split() is equal to 'stash'. This logic is incorrect because in the provided case 'stash' is not always the second argument even if command.script contains 'stash'. 

For example, in the provided test case, it is 'git stash', which means command.script.split() will return ['git', 'stash'] and due to the above logic, the function will incorrectly return True even though there is no 'usage' in command.stderr.

To fix this bug, the match function should check for 'stash' in command.script.split() regardless of its position. This can be achieved by using the 'any' function from itertools module along with a generator expression that checks if 'stash' is in each substring.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import itertools

@github_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()) and ('usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This will correctly identify if 'stash' is used in the command whether it is first or not, and also check if 'usage' is in the error message.
