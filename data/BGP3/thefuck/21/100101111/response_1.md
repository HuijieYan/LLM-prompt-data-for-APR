The bug is in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` rule. The function is splitting the command script by spaces and checking if the second element of the list is 'stash'. However, when the command is simply 'git', the `split()` function returns a list with a single element, and trying to access the second element (`[1]`) results in an `IndexError`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case where the command is just 'git'.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if the command is just 'git' before trying to split it by spaces and access the second element. Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script == 'git':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, if the command is just 'git', the function checks if the stderr contains 'usage:'. If it does, the function returns True. If the command is not just 'git', the function splits the command script by spaces and checks if the second element is 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. If both conditions are met, the function returns True.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
