Here's a breakdown of the buggy function and a corrected version:

**Analysis and identification of error locations:**

1. The function is supposed to check if the `git stash` command is used with an incorrect syntax.
2. The error location is the `return` statement inside the `match` function. Specifically, the condition `command.stderr` might not always contain the string `'usage:'`.

**Cause of the bug:**

The bug is likely that the `command.stderr` might not always contain the string `'usage:'` when the user enters an incorrect `git stash` command, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `command.stderr` contains the expected string ('usage:') before returning `True`. We can do this by checking if the given string is present in the `command.stderr`.

**Corrected version of the buggy function:**

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr 
            and command.stderr.strip().startswith('usage:'))
```

The correction is made by adding `command.stderr.strip().startswith('usage:')` to ensure that the `command.stderr` starts with 'usage:', which means there's an incorrect `git stash` command syntax entered by the user.
