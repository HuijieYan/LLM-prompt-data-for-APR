The bug in the `match` function is that it's trying to split the command/script by space and then access the second element using `[1]`. However, if the command/script does not have a space in it, this will result in an 'IndexError: list index out of range'. 

Additionally, the `command.stderr` is also not checked, it may not always contain 'usage:'.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash') 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In this corrected function, we are using the `startswith` method to check if the command/script starts with 'git stash'. This way, we are avoiding the potential 'IndexError' that might occur if the command/script does not have a space in it.
