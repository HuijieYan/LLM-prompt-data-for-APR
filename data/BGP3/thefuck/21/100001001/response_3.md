I'd be happy to help you fix the buggy function!

Let's analyze the buggy function and the runtime values and types of variables:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

**Identification of error locations:**

1. `command.script.split()[1]`: This line of code is trying to access the second element of the split `script` variable, assuming it's a list. However, if `script` is not a list (e.g., it's a string), this line will raise an error.

**Cause of the bug:**

The bug is likely due to the incorrect assumption about the type of `command.script`. The `split()` method returns a list of strings, but the `script` attribute of the `Command` object might not always be a string that can be split.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

1. Check the type of `command.script` before trying to split it.

**Corrected version:**

Here is the corrected function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.strip()
    return script and (script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                       and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version:

1. We use the `strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the `script` attribute, assuming it's a string. This ensures that we don't try to split a string that might contain whitespace.
2. We check if `script` is truthy (`and script`) before trying to split it. This prevents the function from raising an error if `script` is an empty string or None.

With these changes, the function should correctly identify whether the `git` command output includes a usage message related to the `stash` command.
