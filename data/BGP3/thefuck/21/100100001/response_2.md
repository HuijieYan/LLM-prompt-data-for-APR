The buggy function is designed to match a `git` command that stashes files, and it fails to do so in certain situations where it incorrectly returns `True` for a command that does not stash files.

The buggy function is checking if the command's script contains 'stash' and also if it contains 'usage:', which is not a reliable way to determine whether a command is stashing files or not.

The test function `test_not_mix` is actually checking if the command is not matching the condition specified in the buggy function, and it should pass if the function is corrected correctly.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
- Identify the correct way to determine whether a `git` command is stashing files or not. This could be by checking if the command script contains any of the stash-related commands like 'git stash', 'git stash push', etc.
- Modify the buggy function to check if the command script contains any of these stash-related commands.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and
            any(cmd in command.script for cmd in ['stash', 'stash push', 'stash save']))
```

This function now correctly checks if the command is a `git` command with any of the stash-related commands.
