**Analysis and Identification of Error**

1. The provided code is a function `match` part of a larger Git command completion system. The function checks if the given command is a `git stash` command and if the command's `stderr` output contains the string `usage:`.
2. The bug is in the `match` function. The function is checking if the first word of the command script is `'stash'`, but it might miss cases where `git stash` is used with options or arguments.
3. The test function `test_not_match` is designed to fail if the `match` function becomes too permissive and starts reporting commands that are not `git stash` commands.
4. The cause of the bug is that the function only checks the first word of the command, ignoring any further arguments or options.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

1. Instead of relying solely on the command's first word, we need to verify that it matches the expected command with all its arguments and options.
2. We can achieve this by using the `subprocess` module to split the command into its individual parts and then check if the command name matches the expected name with arguments and options.

**Corrected Version of the Function**

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    expected_command = ['git', 'stash']
    command_parts = command.script.split()[1:]
    return command_parts == expected_command and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In the corrected version, we first split the command into individual parts using the `split` method. Then, we compare the list of parts with the expected `git stash` command. If they match, we check if `stderr` contains the string `'usage:'`. This corrected version of the function will correctly identify `git stash` commands and ignore other commands, as per the requirements.

The corrected function should pass the failing test `test_not_match`.
