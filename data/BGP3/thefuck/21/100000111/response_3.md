The provided function is intended to check if a specific Git command matches a certain pattern. In the given GitHub issue, it seems that the command 'git' alone does not match this rule, because it does not have the expected 'stash' part. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script.lower() and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
This corrected function will return `True` for any command in the Git family (as long as it contains the string 'usage:') when the user tries to fix it.
