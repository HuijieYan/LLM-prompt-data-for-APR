I'll analyze the buggy function and suggest a corrected version.

**Analysis**

The buggy function is `match` which is expected to return a boolean value indicating whether the `git` command matches a certain condition. The condition is that the script is `stash` and the `stderr` output contains the string `usage:`.

**Error locations**

The error is located in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'...`. This line is trying to split the `script` attribute of the `Command` object and access the second element of the resulting list using indexing. However, if the `script` attribute is simply `'git'`, as in the expected case 1, this will raise an `IndexError` because there is no second element in the list.

**Cause of the bug**

The bug is caused by assuming that the `script` attribute will always contain multiple words separated by spaces, which is not necessarily true. In this case, the `script` attribute is simply the `git` command, which does not meet the expected condition.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to check whether the `script` attribute contains the word `stash` regardless of whether it's a single word or a phrase. We can do this by using the `in` operator to check if the word `stash` is in the `script` attribute.

**Corrected version**

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
This corrected version uses the `in` operator to check if the word `stash` is in the `script` attribute, which is a more robust way to match the condition.
