The bug in the function is occurring because it assumes that the `command.script` has at least two elements when splitting it by spaces (`split()[1]` is trying to access the second element of the list). However, in the provided test case, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which is a single-element list when split by spaces. Therefore, accessing the second element (`[1]`) raises an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the `command.script.split()` list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If the list has less than two elements, the function should return `False` because it does not match the expected condition (`command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`).

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@ git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) >= 2 and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function first checks if the `script_split` list has at least two elements using the `len(script_split) >= 2` condition. If the list has at least two elements, it then checks if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. If all conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
