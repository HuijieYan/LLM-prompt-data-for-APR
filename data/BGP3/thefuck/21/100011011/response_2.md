I'd be happy to help you fix the bug.

**Identifying the error location and cause of the bug**

The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` at line 8 of the buggy function. This error occurs when trying to access an element at index `1` of a list (`command.script.split()`) that is either empty or has only one element.

The input `command.script` is `'git'`, which means the `split()` function will return a list with only one element, `[{'git'}]`. Therefore, trying to access the second element (`[1]`) will result in an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `split()` function returns a list with at least two elements, so we can safely access the second element.

**Corrected version of the buggy function**

Here is the corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.split()[0] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
Instead of checking if the second element is equal to `'stash'`, we check if the first element (`[0]`) is equal to `'stash'`. This should fix the issue.

Additionally, we can add a check to ensure that the `split()` function returns a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This is not necessary in this case, but it's a good practice to avoid potential errors:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    if len(parts) >= 2:
        return parts[0] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
