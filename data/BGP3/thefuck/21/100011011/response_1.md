**Bug Analysis**

The bug occurs in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` rule in the `thefuck` library. The function is supposed to identify commands that require a stash action, but it fails when the command is just `git` without any additional arguments.

**Error Message**

The error message is an `IndexError`: "list index out of range". This occurs because the `command.script.split()[1]` expression tries to access the second element of a list that is not long enough.

**Runtime Values and Types**

The input parameters are:
- `command.script`: `'git'` (a string)
- `command`: `Command(script='git', stdout='', stderr='usage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q')` (a `Command` object)
- `command.stderr`: `'\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'` (a string)

**GitHub Issue**

The issue is titled "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git" and reports that the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the command is just `git` without any additional arguments.

**Cause of the Bug**

The bug occurs because the `match` function tries to access the second element of the `command.script` list (`command.script.split()[1]`) to check if the command is `stash`. However, when the command is just `git`, the `script` list only contains one element (`'git'`) and accessing the second element (`[1]`) raises an `IndexError`.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check if the command is `stash` without relying on the second element of the `script` list.

**Corrected Function**

Here is the corrected `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we simply check if the string `'stash'` is present in the `command.script` string and if the `command.stderr` string contains the substring `'usage:'`. If both conditions are true, the function returns `True`, indicating a match for the `git_fix_stash` rule.
