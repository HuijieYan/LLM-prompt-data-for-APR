Let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the test code, error message, and expected input/output values.

The buggy function is defined as:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The test function that fails is:
```python
def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```
The error message is:
```
IndexError: list index out of range
```
The expected input/output values are:

* `command.script`: `'git'` (str)
* `command`: `Command(script=git, stdout=, stderr=...)` (Command)
* `command.stderr`: `usage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q` (str)
* `splited_script`: `['git']` (list)

The bug is in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`, which tries to access the second element of the split script (`command.script.split()[1]`). However, when the script is just `'git'`, the split result would be `['git']`, and there is no second element to access.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to access an element of the split script that does not exist. This is caused by the faulty assumption that the script always starts with `git stash`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to correctly handle cases where the script does not start with `git stash`. One possible fix is to check if the script starts with `git stash` before trying to access the second element:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return script and script[0].startswith(('git', 'stash')) and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
This fix checks if the script starts with either `git` or `stash` before trying to access the second element. If the script does not start with either, the function returns `False`. This should satisfy all the expected input/output values.
