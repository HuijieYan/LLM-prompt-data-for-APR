The bug in this function is related to accessing `command.script.split()[1]` when `command.script.split()` returns an empty list. This is because the `split()[1]` index can only be accessed if the list has at least two elements.

In this case, the error is caused by the `IndexError: list index out of range`, which means that the list returned by `command.script.split()` has less than two elements. Checking if `command.script.split()` returns an empty list beforehand should fix this bug.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@ git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_parts) > 1 and  # Check if the list has at least two elements
        script_parts[1] == 'stash' and
        'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

In this corrected function, the `len(script_parts) > 1` check ensures that we don't access the index 1 of an empty list, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring. If the length of `script_parts` is indeed 1 or less, it means that the `command.script` does not contain a space character, so it is not a valid command to fix the stash.
