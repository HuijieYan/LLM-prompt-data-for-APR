The bug in the function is due to the fact that the command.script.split()[1] might not exist if the script has only one word (i.e., 'git'). So, when trying to access the second element of the list (i.e., [1], which is equivalent to index 1), Python raises an IndexError because it's trying to access an index that doesn't exist.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'git stash' in command.script.lower() and 'usage:' in command.stderr.lower()
```

In this corrected version, instead of trying to split the script into words and accessing the second word, it checks if 'git stash' is in the script (in a case-insensitive manner) and if 'usage:' is in the stderr output. This should fix the issue and make the function work correctly.

The GitHub issue states that the 'git_fix_stash' rule fails when the script is just 'git'. This occurs because the original function tries to split the script into words and then checks if the second word is 'stash'. However, when the script is just 'git', there is no second word, causing the IndexError. The corrected function addresses this issue by directly checking if 'git stash' is in the script.
