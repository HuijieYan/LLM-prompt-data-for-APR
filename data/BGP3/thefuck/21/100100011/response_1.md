I'll help you fix the buggy function.

**Step 1: Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with test code, the GitHub issue.**

The function is `match()` from `thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py`, which is supposed to match when a command contains `git stash`. The test function `test_not_match()` expects the `match()` function to return `False` when the command is `git` only. However, the test function is failing. The GitHub issue is about the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just `git`.

**Step 2: Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.**

The potential error location is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. We're trying to split the command script and check if the second element is `stash`. However, this might raise an error if the command script doesn't contain enough elements to access the second element.

**Step 3: Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test, and the GitHub Issue information.**

The bug is caused by the fact that the `match()` function is trying to split the command script and check if the second element is `stash`. However, when the command is only `git`, the script would be something like `['git']`, causing an index out of range error when trying to access the second element.

**Step 4: Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.**

To fix the bug, we should check if the command script contains the word `stash` instead of relying on the position of the element in the script.

**Step 5: Provide a corrected version of the buggy function.**

Here's the corrected version of the `match()` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
In this corrected version, we're simply checking if the word `stash` is present in the command script, regardless of its position. This should fix the bug and make the test function `test_not_match()` pass.
