Analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with test code, corresponding error message, and GitHub issue:

1.  The buggy function is `match` from `git_fix_stash.py`, and it returns `True` if the `git` command's script is `stash` and its stderr contains `usage:`.
2.  The test function `test_not_match` from `test_git_fix_stash.py` is failing, and it asserts that the `match` function returns `False` for the `Command` object with script `git` and stderr with `git_stash_err`.
3.  The error message is `IndexError: list index out of range` from `thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py:8`, which means that the function is trying to access the second element of a list (index 1) when the list is empty.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:

*   The condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is the cause of the error. When the command's script is just `git`, the `split()` function returns a list of length 1, and accessing the second element (index 1) results in an `IndexError`.

Cause of the bug:

*   The bug is caused by incorrectly assuming that the `git` command's script will always have at least two elements (the command name and its arguments). When the command name is `git` alone, the script is a single-element list, causing the index-out-of-range error.

Strategy for fixing the bug:

*   Check if the `split()` function returns a list with at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Changes made:

*   Added `len(script_parts) >= 2` to check if the `split()` function returns a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element.
*   This ensures that the `IndexError` is avoided when the command name is `git` alone.
