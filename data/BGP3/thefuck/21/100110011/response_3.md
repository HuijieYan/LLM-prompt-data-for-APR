Here is the analysis and solution to the bug:

**Analysis**:

1. The buggy function is `match(command)` from `thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py`. It's decorated with `@git_support`.
2. The function checks if the script is `git stash` and if the stderr contains `usage:`. If both conditions are true, it returns `True`.
3. The test case `test_not_match()` from `tests/rules/test_git_fix_stash.py` fails. The command script is simply `git`, which does not have any arguments. Therefore, the `command.script.split()[1]` expression raises an `IndexError` because there are no arguments to split.
4. The GitHub issue is about the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just `git`.

**Error location and cause**:

The bug is in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. When the script is just `git`, the command has no arguments, and `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element (`['git']`). Therefore, `command.script.split()[1]` raises an `IndexError` because there is no second element in the list.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**:

To fix the bug, we need to check if the script is `git stash` and if the stderr contains `usage:` regardless of the arguments. We can do this by checking if `command.stderr` contains `usage:` and then splitting the script to check if it starts with `git stash`.

**Corrected version**:

Here is the corrected version of the `match(command)` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In this corrected version, we check if the script contains `git stash` and if the stderr contains `usage:`. If both conditions are true, the function returns `True`. This fix resolves the issue and makes the test case `test_not_match()` pass.
