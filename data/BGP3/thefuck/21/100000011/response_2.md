The bug is caused by the fact that the `command.script` is the entire command line, including the `git` command itself. When the command is simply `git` with no arguments, the list `[1]` does not exist, hence the `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the list has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the first element of the `command.script.split()` list is 'git', and then we check if the second element is 'stash'. This way, we avoid the `IndexError` when the command is simply `git`.
