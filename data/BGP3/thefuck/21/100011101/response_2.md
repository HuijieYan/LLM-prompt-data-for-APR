Based on the error message and the analysis provided, I can identify the bug and suggest a correction.

The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` by spaces to get the second word, but it might not always be similar to `['stash']`. This is because the function doesn't check if the split operation was successful.

The bug is due to the fact that the input `command.script` is not always split into two elements (the first being 'git' and the second being the command name), and when it happens, `command.script.split()[1]` raises an `IndexError` because it's trying to access the second element of an empty list.

The bug is also triggered by the presence of the `\n` character in `command.stderr`, which makes the comparison `command.stderr.find('usage:') == 0` always fail.

To fix the bug, we should always check if the split operation is successful before trying to access the second element of the list. We also need to make sure that the comparison is done correctly, taking into account the presence of the `\n` character.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we use `len(script_parts) > 1` to check if the split operation is successful before trying to access `script_parts[1]`. This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
