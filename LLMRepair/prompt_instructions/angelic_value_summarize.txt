You have been given the source code of a function that is currently failing its test cases. Accompanying this, you will find detailed information on the expected inputs and outputs for the function. This includes the value and type of each input parameter as well as the expected value and type of relevant variables when the function returns. Should an input parameter's value not be explicitly mentioned in the expected output, you can assume it has not changed. Your task is to ensure the function is corrected to meet all these specified conditions.

Your mission involves a thorough analysis, where you'll need to correlate the specific variable values noted during the function's execution with the source code itself. By meticulously examining and referencing particular sections of the buggy code alongside the variable logs, you're to construct a coherent and detailed analysis. This scrutiny is crucial for pinpointing the root causes of failure and figuring out the necessary adjustments to the function.

We are seeking a comprehensive and insightful investigation that goes beyond merely rectifying the errors. Your analysis should offer a deeper understanding of the function's behavior and logic. This detailed exploration will contribute to a more effective and informed debugging process.
