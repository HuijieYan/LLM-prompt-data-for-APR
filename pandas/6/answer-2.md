Based on the provided code snippet and description of the problem, it seems like the code is trying to check if an object named 'gpr' has a 'name' attribute and then try to access 'obj' with 'gpr.name' as the key/index. Probably, 'obj' hasn't been defined anywhere in the given code snippet. Also, it's not quite clear what this 'obj' is or supposed to be. Assuming 'obj' is a dictionary or list in the global scope, you need to explicitly identify it as a global variable.

Also, for a 'PeriodIndex' data structure from pandas, it could cause trouble when it's used as a dictionary key due to the fact some objects in pandas are mutable which are not safe to be used in as keys in a dictionary. If this is the case, the fix may involve converting 'PeriodIndex' to another data type which can be used as a dictionary key:

Fixed source code is:

```
# assuming obj is a dictionary and in global scope
def is_in_obj(gpr) -> bool:
	global obj

	if not hasattr(gpr, "name"):
		return False
	try:
		key = str(gpr.name)  # convert potentially mutable gpr.name to a string
		return gpr is obj[key]
	except (KeyError, IndexError):
		return False
```

Please note this is just an assumption. You might to review the structure and objective of the entire codebase to ascertain the root cause of the raised issue, and revise the fix accordingly.
