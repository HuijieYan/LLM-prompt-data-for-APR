Based on the information you've provided, it seems that the issue is related to the usage of the variable obj without its declaration or initialization in the code snippet. To fix this bug, I'll assume that obj is a dictionary-like object containing elements indexed by their name attributes. Here's a modified version of your code that should address the issue while making minimal changes:

    def is_in_obj(gpr, obj) -> bool:
    if not hasattr(gpr, "name"):
        return False
    try:
        return gpr is obj.get(gpr.name)
    except (KeyError, IndexError):
        return False


In this version of the code, I've added an additional parameter obj to the is_in_obj function, which represents the dictionary-like object that contains elements. I've replaced obj[gpr.name] with obj.get(gpr.name) to handle the case when the key gpr.name is not found in the dictionary without raising an exception.

Please integrate this modified code into your project, passing the obj parameter whenever you call the is_in_obj function. This change should fix the "Series.groupby raise ValueError" issue while maintaining compatibility with existing tests and functionality.
