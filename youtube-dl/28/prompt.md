# Prompt

You need to fix a bug in a python code snippet, which failed on test and got ValueError while invoking compat_chr API. You need to provide a drop-in replacement, which means minimum changes to source code to pass failed test while won't affect other passed tests. And the fixed patch can be directly used in original project.
The buggy source code is following:
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        # See https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/7518
        return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)

And the fix commit of the project author is Skip invalid/non HTML entities.

# LLM Answer

It looks like the issue in the code is related to handling invalid or non-HTML entities, which is resulting in a ValueError when trying to invoke the compat_chr API. To fix this and incorporate the project author's fix of skipping invalid entities, you can modify the code like this:

    import re

    def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
        """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
        # Known non-numeric HTML entity
        if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
            return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

        mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
        if mobj is not None:
            numstr = mobj.group(1)
            if numstr.startswith('x'):
                base = 16
                numstr = '0%s' % numstr
            else:
                base = 10
            try:
                return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
            except ValueError:
                # Skip invalid entities
                pass

        # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
        return ('&%s;' % entity)

The key change here is the addition of a try-except block around the conversion of the numeric HTML entity to a character. If the conversion raises a ValueError, which indicates an invalid entity, the code skips the entity and returns the literal representation of the entity as it is.

This change should allow the code to gracefully handle invalid entities and pass the failed test without affecting other passed tests.
