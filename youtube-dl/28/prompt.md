You need to fix a bug in a python code snippet, which failed on test and got ValueError while invoking compat_chr API.

The buggy source code with comment inside is following, and you should follow all specification in comment:

    def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
        """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
        # Known non-numeric HTML entity
        if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
            return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

        mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
        if mobj is not None:
            numstr = mobj.group(1)
            if numstr.startswith('x'):
                base = 16
                numstr = '0%s' % numstr
            else:
                base = 10
            # See https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/7518
            return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

        # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
        return ('&%s;' % entity)


And the raised issue description for this bug is 'ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000)'.


You need to provide a drop-in replacement, with 'minimum changes to source code' that 'pass failed test' while 'won't affect other already passed tests'. And the fixed patch can be directly used in original project.
