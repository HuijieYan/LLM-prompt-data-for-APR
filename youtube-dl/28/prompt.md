# Prompt

You need to fix a bug in a python code snippet, which failed on test and got ValueError while invoking compat_chr API. You need to provide a drop-in replacement, which means minimum changes to source code to pass failed test while won't affect other passed tests. And the fixed patch can be directly used in original project.
The buggy source code is following:

    def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
        """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
        # Known non-numeric HTML entity
        if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
            return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

        mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
        if mobj is not None:
            numstr = mobj.group(1)
            if numstr.startswith('x'):
                base = 16
                numstr = '0%s' % numstr
            else:
                base = 10
            # See https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/7518
            return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

        # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
        return ('&%s;' % entity)

# LLM Answer

It looks like the issue is related to the usage of the compat_chr function, which is causing a ValueError. To fix this issue while minimizing changes to the code, you can directly use the built-in chr function instead. Here's the modified code:

    import re
    from html import entities as compat_html_entities

    def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
        """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
        # Known non-numeric HTML entity
        if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
            return chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

        mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
        if mobj is not None:
            numstr = mobj.group(1)
            if numstr.startswith('x'):
                base = 16
                numstr = '0%s' % numstr
            else:
                base = 10
            # See https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/7518
            return chr(int(numstr, base))

        # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
        return ('&%s;' % entity)

The main change here is replacing compat_chr with chr which is a built-in Python function. This should fix the ValueError issue while maintaining compatibility with the original code structure.
