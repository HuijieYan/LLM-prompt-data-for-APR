It seems like the issue here is that the value variable can be None in the update_headers function, and the code doesn't handle this case properly. To fix this bug while making minimal changes to the source code and preserving the existing behavior, you can modify the code like this:

    def update_headers(self, request_headers):
        """
        Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
        certain name prefixes.

        :type request_headers: dict

        """
        for name, value in request_headers.items():
            if value is None:
                continue  # Ignore explicitly unset headers
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value

The only change here is the addition of the if value is None: check at the beginning of the loop iteration to skip headers with a None value.

This modification ensures that if a header has a None value, it will be ignored without attempting to decode it or modify it. This should address the AttributeError that occurs when trying to decode a None value.

Please replace the existing update_headers function with this modified version, and it should fix the bug without affecting other tests that are already passing.
