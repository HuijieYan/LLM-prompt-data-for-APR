To fix the issue and pass the failed test while minimizing changes to the existing code, you need to adjust the max_redirects parameter in the kwargs dictionary that is passed to the requests_session.request() method. The problem is that the max_redirects parameter is not being properly set in the request, causing the test to fail due to too many redirects. Here's the modified code snippet that should address the issue:

    def get_response(args, config_dir):
    """Send the request and return a `request.Response`."""

    requests_session = get_requests_session()

    if not args.session and not args.session_read_only:
        kwargs = get_requests_kwargs(args)
        if args.debug:
            dump_request(kwargs)
        
        # Add this line to set the max_redirects parameter
        kwargs['max_redirects'] = args.max_redirects  # Assuming args.max_redirects contains the value

        response = requests_session.request(**kwargs)
    else:
        response = sessions.get_response(
            requests_session=requests_session,
            args=args,
            config_dir=config_dir,
            session_name=args.session or args.session_read_only,
            read_only=bool(args.session_read_only),
        )

    return response

In this modification, the key step is adding the line kwargs['max_redirects'] = args.max_redirects before making the request using the requests_session.request() method. This ensures that the max_redirects parameter is properly set and considered in the request.

With this change, the test should pass as it now has access to the correct max_redirects parameter value, which is needed to properly handle the redirects during the test. This change shouldn't affect other tests that are already passing, as you're only modifying the parameter that relates to handling redirects.
