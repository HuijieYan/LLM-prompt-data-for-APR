Sure, I understand the issue and the requirements. The bug seems to occur when removing the first or last rule due to the way the linked list is being manipulated. To fix this bug, you need to adjust the logic in the remove function. Here's the fixed code snippet:

    def remove(self, rule_type, rule_control, rule_path):
        current_line = self._head
        changed = 0

        while current_line is not None:
            if current_line.matches(rule_type, rule_control, rule_path):
                if current_line.prev is not None:
                    current_line.prev.next = current_line.next
                else:
                    self._head = current_line.next

                if current_line.next is not None:
                    current_line.next.prev = current_line.prev

                changed += 1
            current_line = current_line.next
        return changed

The only change made here is to ensure that the prev and next pointers of neighboring nodes are updated correctly, even when removing the first or last node. This change should address the AttributeError that occurs when trying to access prev or next attributes on a node that could be None.

Please replace the original remove function in your code with the fixed version provided above. This change should fix the bug while maintaining the existing functionality and not affecting other already passed tests.
