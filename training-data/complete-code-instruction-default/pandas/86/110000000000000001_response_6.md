The potential error in the function is within the "if values is None" conditional statement. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling and manipulation of the input parameters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the cases where "values" is None or not None, leading to incorrect indexing and unstacking of the data.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the cases where "values" is None and where it is not None, by restructuring the conditional statements and the subsequent data manipulation steps.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        if index is None:
            indexed = data.set_index(columns)
        else:
            indexed = data.set_index([index, columns])
    else:
        indexed = data.pivot(index=index, columns=columns, values=values)
        
    return indexed
```

In the corrected code, we have restructured the conditional statements to properly handle the cases where "values" is None or not None. Additionally, for the case where "values" is not None, we have used the built-in pivot function of the DataFrame to pivot the data based on the specified index, columns, and values.
