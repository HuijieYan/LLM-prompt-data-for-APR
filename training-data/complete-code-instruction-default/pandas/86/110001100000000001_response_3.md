1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is responsible for reshaping data using pivot tables. It takes in a DataFrame and reshapes it based on the specified index, columns, and values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the conditional check for the 'values' parameter. Depending on the condition, the function takes different actions, and there might be a mistake in handling these different scenarios.

3. The potential bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function has conditional branches based on the 'values' parameter, where it tries to construct a new DataFrame based on different input scenarios.
   (b). The bug could be caused by incorrectly handling the different input scenarios, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Refactor the conditional logic to ensure that all possible input scenarios are handled correctly.
   - Verify the implementation of the conditional logic and make sure that it aligns with the expected behavior for different input scenarios.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

# corrected function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.pivot_table(index=index, columns=columns, aggfunc='mean')  # assuming a default pivot table behavior here
    else:
        indexed = data.pivot(index=index, columns=columns, values=values)  # assuming a default pivot behavior here
    return indexed
```

In the corrected code, the conditional logic has been removed and replaced with direct calls to the pivot or pivot_table functions based on the presence of the 'values' parameter. This should ensure that the function behaves as intended for different input scenarios.
