Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for 'values' being None. As per the docstring and the related functions, 'values' can be optional, but 'columns' is not. However, the error message generated does not clearly convey this and is confusing.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function 'pivot' is trying to handle the case where 'columns' is None, but it does not raise a clear error message in this scenario.
(b). The failing test function 'test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error' is trying to test the scenario where 'columns' is passed as None, but the current error message is misleading.
(c). The failing test throws a KeyError with confusing error message 'KeyError: None of [None] are in the columns', which does not accurately convey that 'columns' cannot be None.
(d). The GitHub issue raises the concern that the error message is unclear and proposes that it should explicitly state that 'columns' is not optional.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the conditional check for 'columns' being None to raise a clear error message indicating that 'columns' is not optional.
2. Update the code to handle the scenario where 'columns' is None and provide a specific error message accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

The fixed function includes a check to ensure that 'columns' is not None and raises a clear error message if it is. This should satisfy the failing test and also resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
