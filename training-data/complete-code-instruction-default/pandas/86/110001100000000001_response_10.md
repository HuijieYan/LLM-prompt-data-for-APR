1. The buggy function appears to be a pivot function that takes in a DataFrame and pivots it based on the index, columns, and values provided. It seems that the function is trying to reshape the DataFrame with the specified index and column values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where it checks if values is None, and then tries to set the index and columns based on that. This section seems to be handling the case where values is None, but it is not handling the case where values is not None.

3. The buggy function is trying to handle two different cases - one where values is None and another where values is not None. The cause of the bug seems to stem from the function not handling the case where values is not None properly. This is leading to incorrect pivoting of the DataFrame.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to refactor the function to handle both cases (values is None and values is not None) separately. This could involve restructuring the conditional statements and the logic within the function to properly set the index and columns based on the input values.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

# this is the corrected function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
        return indexed.unstack(columns)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
        return indexed.unstack(columns)
```
