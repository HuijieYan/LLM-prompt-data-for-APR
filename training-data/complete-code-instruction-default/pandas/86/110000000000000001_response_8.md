1. The buggy function takes in a DataFrame and performs a pivot operation on it. It handles the cases when the "values" parameter is provided and when it is not. However, there are potential issues with the indexing and column handling.

2. The potential error location is in the handling of index and columns, especially when "values" is not None.

3. The bug's cause:
   The bug occurs when the "values" parameter is not None. The function does not handle the index and columns correctly when "values" is provided, leading to incorrect results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly handle the index and column creation when "values" is not None.
   - Make sure that the index and columns are set appropriately when "values" is provided.

5. The corrected code:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex, is_list_like

@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data.loc[:, values].set_index(index).unstack(columns)
        else:
            indexed = data[values].unstack(columns)
    return indexed
```
In the corrected code:
- When "values" is provided, the index is appropriately set using MultiIndex.from_arrays and then unstacked based on the columns.
- For the case where "values" is a list (and not a tuple), the dataframe is first sliced to include only the specified values, then the index is set and unstacked based on the columns.
- The corrected code ensures that the index and columns are handled correctly for all cases.
