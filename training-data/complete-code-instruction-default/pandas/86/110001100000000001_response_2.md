1. The buggy function is a pivot function which takes a DataFrame and performs a pivot operation by reshaping the data. It uses the arguments index, columns, and values to determine the new shape of the DataFrame.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement for checking if values is None, as well as the subsequent conditional statements for handling different cases of index and values.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the conditional statements not properly handling the cases when index and values are provided or not provided. This can lead to unexpected behavior when performing the pivot operation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Restructuring the conditional statements to properly handle the cases when index and values are provided or not provided.
   - Ensuring that the pivot operation is performed correctly based on the provided arguments.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is not None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([data[index], data[columns]])
        
        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(data[values].values, index=index, columns=values)
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statement for setting the 'append' variable has been updated to ensure it correctly reflects the index. Additionally, the handling of the 'index' variable has been modified to properly create a MultiIndex object using 'from_arrays'. Overall, these changes aim to address the potential error locations and provide a more robust pivot function.
