The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function lies in the `_get_level_number` method, where it is trying to extract the level number for 'A' from the MultiIndex. The current logic does not handle the case of a tuple containing multiple level names. This results in an error when trying to unstack the multi-index DataFrame using a tuple of level names. 

To fix this, the `_get_level_number` method needs to be modified to handle the case when the input level is a tuple. It should extract the level number for each name in the tuple and return a list of level numbers.

Additionally, the function needs to be modified to handle the case when the input `clocs` is a tuple of level names. It should extract the level number for each name in the tuple and use them to obtain the corresponding codes, levels, and names from the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _get_level_number(self, levels):
    if isinstance(levels, str):
        levels = [levels]  # Convert to list if it's a string
    return [self.names.index(level) for level in levels]

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the level numbers for the input clocs
    clocs = data.index._get_level_number(clocs)

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version of the function includes the modified `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple input and uses the extracted level numbers for further processing. This should fix the issue and make the function pass the failing test cases.
