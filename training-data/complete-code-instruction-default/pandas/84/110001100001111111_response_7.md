The bug is caused by the function `_unstack_multiple` which fails to handle MultiIndex with tuple names. This leads to a KeyError and a subsequent failure.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified to correctly handle MultiIndex with tuple names.

The updated and corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

With this modification, the `clocs` are checked for tuple names, and if found, the function `_get_level_number` is called to correctly handle MultiIndex with tuple names.

This corrected code should now be able to handle MultiIndex with tuple names and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
