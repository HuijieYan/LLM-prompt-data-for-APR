The potential error in the problematic function `_unstack_multiple` lies in the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line. The error message indicates a KeyError and a ValueError relating to the `_get_level_number` method. This method should return the level number, but it seems to be encountering issues due to the structure of the multi-index.

The bug likely arises from the way the function is handling hierarchical columns in the multi-index, leading to errors in getting the level number.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to properly handle hierarchical columns in the multi-index. This involves modifying how the level number is retrieved and how the unstacking is performed with respect to hierarchical columns.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Fix for hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs[0]]
    else:
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

This update includes a check for hierarchical columns and modifies the extraction of level numbers accordingly. This should address the issues with the multi-index structure and resolve the KeyError and ValueError encountered in the failing tests.
