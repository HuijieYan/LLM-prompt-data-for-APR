Potential error location: There are multiple potential error locations in the function, beginning with the handling of the index and column levels. Additionally, the conditional statements for handling different data types (Series vs. not Series) and MultiIndex columns could lead to issues.

Bug's cause: The bug is likely due to the incorrect manipulation of the index, incorrect unstacking of the data, and potential mishandling of different data types and index types.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle the hierarchical columns.
2. Ensure correct unstacking of the data for Series and non-Series data types.
3. Handle MultiIndex columns correctly.

Corrected code:
```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = pd.Index(ccodes[0], name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [ccodes[0]],
            codes=rcodes + [ccodes[0]],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
