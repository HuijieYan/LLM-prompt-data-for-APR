The buggy function is a part of a larger module within the Pandas library that handles multi-indexing features. The GitHub issue describes a situation where the `unstack` method is failing with a `KeyError` when dealing with multi-indexed series, specifically when using a tuple of names to unstack.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the section where it deals with identifying the level numbers of the columns within the index and retrieving their corresponding codes.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle multi-indexed series with tuple names correctly, leading to `KeyError` when trying to unstack a multi-index with tuple names.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle multi-indexed series with tuple names and allow for unstacking based on the tuple of names.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    # Modification to handle multi-indexed series with tuple names
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        if all(isinstance(name, tuple) for name in index.names):  # Check if all names are tuples
            clocs = [index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]  # Get the level number for each tuple name
        else:  # If not all names are tuples, return original data
            return data
   
    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By adding the modification mentioned above, the function should now be able to correctly handle multi-indexed series with tuple names and should resolve the issue described in the GitHub thread.
