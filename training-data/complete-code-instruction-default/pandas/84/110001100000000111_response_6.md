The bug is causing a KeyError when attempting to unstack a Series with a MultiIndex when the level to stack is passed in as a tuple of names.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number` function is trying to index the level name when it should be trying to get the level number.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to ensure that the level names are correctly converted to level numbers using the `index._get_level_number` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```
