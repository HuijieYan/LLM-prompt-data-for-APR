The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where the function differentiates between whether the input data is a Series or a DataFrame and performs different operations based on that.

The bug's cause is likely due to inconsistent handling of the input data when it's a multi-index DataFrame, leading to incorrect unstacking and indexing operations.

To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent handling of the input data regardless of its type and structure, and also ensure proper indexing and unstacking operations for multi-index data.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Check if the data is a Series or DataFrame
    is_series = isinstance(data, pd.Series)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = pd.Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if is_series:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        result = data
        for loc in clocs:
            result = result.unstack(result.columns[loc], fill_value=fill_value)

        unstacked = result
        unstcols = unstacked.index if is_series else unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names[0]] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = pd.MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if is_series:
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
In the corrected code, we ensure consistent handling of the input data by checking if it's a Series or a DataFrame, and then performing the unstacking and indexing operations accordingly. We also make sure to use the correct index and columns in all operations, especially when dealing with multi-index DataFrames.
