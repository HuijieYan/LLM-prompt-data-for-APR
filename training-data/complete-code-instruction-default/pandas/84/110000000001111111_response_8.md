The issue here seems to be related to the `unstack` method failing when the index has tuple names. This is due to the `_unstack_multiple` function in the Pandas library, which is being called by the `unstack` method. The function seems to have a bug when dealing with MultiIndexes with tuple names.

Based on the expected input/output variable information and the GitHub issue, the issue seems to be an error in identifying the level number of the input `clocs` tuple.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to correctly convert the tuple names in `clocs` to their corresponding level numbers. Additionally, other operations performed inside the function need to account for MultiIndexes with tuple names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # Convert tuple names to level numbers if necessary

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

With this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly handle MultiIndexes with tuple names when unstacking. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread as well.

By making this change, the bug should be fixed and the function should now work as expected for the provided test cases and also resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub thread.
