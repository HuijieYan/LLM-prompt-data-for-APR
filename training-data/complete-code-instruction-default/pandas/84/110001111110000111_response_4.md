The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to unstack a MultiIndex DataFrame using the levels provided in the `clocs` list. It handles single level unstacking correctly, but fails when we want to unstack using tuples as level names.

The root cause of the issue seems to be how the levels are being obtained and handled in the `clocs` list. The function should properly handle multiple levels in a MultiIndex DataFrame, including the case where the level names are tuples.

The failing tests indicate that the error is occurring when trying to get the level number for a given level, which is not being handled properly for tuple names in the MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle the retrieval of level numbers, and also handle the case when the level names are tuples in the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected function for `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for level in clocs:
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            level_number = index.names.index(level)
            cloc_numbers.append(level_number)
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(level))

    rloc_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    # Finally, return the unstacked data
```

With this fix, the function should be able to correctly handle the unstacking for both single level and tuple named levels in the MultiIndex DataFrame.

This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue. It allows for unstacking of MultiIndex DataFrames with tuple level names, which was causing the KeyError in the original function.
