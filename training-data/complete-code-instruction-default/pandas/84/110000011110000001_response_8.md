The issue in the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is with the line:
```
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line attempts to get the level number for each item in `clocs` using the `_get_level_number` method of the `index`. However, this method is expecting a level name or number as an input, and it might not be able to handle tuples as shown in the failing test. This is causing the ValueError and KeyError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the problematic line should be changed to handle multi-level indices. Additionally, some checks and adjustments need to be done for different types of input to cover all cases.

A possible approach to fix the bug:
1. Check if the input `clocs` is a tuple or a list of tuples.
2. If `clocs` is a list of tuples, obtain the level numbers for each tuple in `clocs` using a loop and then use these level numbers for further processing.
3. If `clocs` is a single tuple, directly use it to get the level number for processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    if isinstance(clocs[0], (tuple, list)):  # Check if clocs is a list of tuples
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected code should handle both single and multi-level index names input for `clocs` and ensure that the function passes the failing test cases.
