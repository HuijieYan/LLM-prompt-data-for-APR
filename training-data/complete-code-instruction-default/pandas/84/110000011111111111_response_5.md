The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an error in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class. The method is unable to handle tuple names when unstacking, resulting in a `KeyError` or `ValueError` in some cases.

The expected variable values indicate that the function is not correctly handling multi-level indices with tuple names.

Based on the failing test, the error is due to the `_get_level_number` method not properly handling tuple names. This method should be modified to handle tuple names in a multi-index.

The corrected function to fix this issue is provided below. This fix should address the errors related to tuple names in multi-index unstacking.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code

    # Modify the _get_level_number method to handle tuple names
    def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            indices = [self.names.index(name) for name in level]
            return indices
        count = self.names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not pd.api.types.is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(
                f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number"
            )
        else:
            try:
                return self.names.index(level)
            except ValueError:
                raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

    index._get_level_number = _get_level_number.__get__(index, index.__class__)

    # Rest of the code

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should handle tuple names within multi-index data when unstacking. It has modified the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names by returning the indexes of each name in the tuple.
