The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is related to the issue "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError". This issue occurs when trying to unstack a MultiIndexed Series using the unstack() method and passing tuple names as arguments.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line is causing an error because it is trying to retrieve the level number based on the provided names. However, the issue in GitHub clearly states that this operation is failing with a KeyError.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function is expecting the level names to be passed directly, but when tuple names are used, it encounters a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle tuple names correctly and extract the level number based on the tuple names. This may require modifying the logic for extracting level numbers and handling tuple names.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[0]) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a condition to check if the level name is a tuple. If it is a tuple, then we extract the level number based on the first element of the tuple. This modification should allow the function to handle tuple names correctly and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
