The issue seems to be related to the unstacking of a MultiIndexed DataFrame using tuple names. The problem is occurring at the `_unstack_multiple` function in the file `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`. The error message indicates that the function `_get_level_number` is unable to find the level 'A' in the MultiIndex.

The failing test functions `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` are specifically designed to test the unstacking behavior with tuple names in a MultiIndex, and they are failing with a KeyError.

The GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" provides a detailed account of the problem encountered when unstacking a MultiIndexed Series and requests for assistance from relevant developers.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle the unstacking of a MultiIndexed DataFrame with tuple names properly.

The following corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function addresses the issue:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [(index._get_level_number(i),) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function stays the same as the original code
```

This fix modifies the section of code that deals with getting the level number from the MultiIndex. It checks if the first element of `clocs` is a tuple, and if so, it converts each tuple into a single-element tuple to resolve the issue.

With this correction, the failing tests `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` should pass successfully, and the GitHub issue "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" should be resolved.
