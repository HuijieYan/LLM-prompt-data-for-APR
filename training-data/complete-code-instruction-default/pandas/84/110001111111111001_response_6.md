The issue exists in the `_get_level_number` function, which is called within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error arises when trying to find the index of a level that is not present in the `names` attribute of the MultiIndex.

The `_get_level_number` function is raising a `ValueError` when the level name is not found, but the failing tests are expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.

The potential error location is identified within the `_get_level_number` function, where the code is trying to find the index of a level name in the `names` attribute of the MultiIndex and raising the wrong type of error.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` function should be modified to raise a `KeyError` when the level name is not found, which is consistent with the failing tests. Additionally, any other discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variables should be addressed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def _get_level_number(level) -> int:
        count = index.names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        try:
            level = index.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            if not is_integer(level):
                raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and produce the expected output for the provided input values.
