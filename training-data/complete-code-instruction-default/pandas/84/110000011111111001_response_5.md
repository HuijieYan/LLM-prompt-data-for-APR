Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class from the `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` file. The error messages indicate that the method is unable to find the level name 'A' within the list of level names. This method is used in the `_unstack_multiple` function in the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file, which is called by the `unstack` method in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file.

Bug cause: The `_get_level_number` method is not able to handle the tuple parameter 'unstack_idx' correctly, possibly due to incorrect usage of the tuple for finding level numbers in the MultiIndex.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:

1. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the tuple input for unstacking MultiIndex.
2. Modify the way the level numbers are obtained from the MultiIndex using the tuple provided.
3. Ensure that the level names in the MultiIndex are properly located and handled for unstacking.

Corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    levels = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in levels]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in levels]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in levels]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in levels]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function as it is
    # ...
```

This corrected function uses the provided tuple for 'clocs' to obtain the level numbers in a way that handles both single levels and tuples of levels. This ensures that the level names in the MultiIndex are correctly located and handled for unstacking, thereby addressing the bug.
