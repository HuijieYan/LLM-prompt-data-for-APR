1. The _unstack_multiple function is related to the GitHub issue because it is called from the unstack method, which is causing the error in the GitHub issue. The unstack method itself is calling the _unstack_multiple function, which is supposed to handle multi-indexed unstack operations, but it appears to have a bug that is causing the KeyError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it attempts to get the level number for the given index.

3. (a). The buggy function (_unstack_multiple) attempts to handle multi-indexed unstack operations, but it encounters a KeyError when trying to get the level number for the given index.

   (b). The GitHub Issue information provides an example where the unstack operation fails, resulting in a KeyError: "KeyError: 'Level A not found'".

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if the level names provided for unstacking are valid multi-index level names.
   - Handling the case where the level names provided for unstacking are not found in the multi-index.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

The key fix here is to handle the case where the provided level names for unstacking are strings, and to use the provided level numbers directly if they are not strings. This should prevent the KeyError when trying to get the level number for the given index.
