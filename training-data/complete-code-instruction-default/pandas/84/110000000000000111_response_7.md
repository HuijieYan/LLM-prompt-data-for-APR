1. The buggy function appears to be unstacking a MultiIndexed DataFrame or Series, and the error message from the GitHub issue references a KeyError when trying to unstack a specific level of the MultiIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when it tries to get the level number of the MultiIndex using the names of the levels. This is evident in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` in the _unstack_multiple function.

3. The bug is caused by the function not properly handling tuple names for levels in the MultiIndex. When attempting to unstack a MultiIndex using a tuple name, such as ("A", "a"), the function raises a KeyError because it cannot find the level with that name. This is in line with the KeyError in the GitHub issue, where it references `'Level A not found'`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include modifying the function to properly handle tuple names for levels in the MultiIndex, ensuring that it can accurately retrieve the level number for unstacking.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handling hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
        return result
    else:
        # Handling regular specified indexes
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle unstacking for both regular indexes and MultiIndexes, including those with tuple names for levels. The function now includes separate handling for hierarchical columns and regular specified indexes based on the provided input and correctly determines the level for unstacking.
