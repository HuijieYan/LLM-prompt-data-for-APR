### Bug Analysis:
The `KeyError` and `ValueError` are being raised in the `_get_level_number` function inside the `_unstack_multiple` function. This function is used to retrieve the level number based on the level name from the index. The raised errors indicate that the level name is not found in the list of names.

### Bug Cause:
The probable cause for the bug is that the level name passed to the `_get_level_number` function does not exist in the list of names, leading to the `KeyError`. This is probably due to incorrect handling of multi-index column names.

### Possible Approaches:
1. Check if the level name should be accessed differently for multi-index column names.
2. Ensure that the level name is correctly extracted from the multi-index.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [
        index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs
    ]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

The corrected code includes the addition of a conditional check in the `clocs` list comprehension to handle extracting the level number from a tuple if the input is a tuple. This should address the potential source of the bug.
