1. The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple` which is called by the `unstack` method of a DataFrame. The failing test is testing the `unstack` method with MultiIndex and is failing due to a KeyError. The error message indicates that the `level` being used in the `_get_level_number` method is not found in the MultiIndex names.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_get_level_number` method, as it is unable to find the level in the MultiIndex names.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_get_level_number` method is unable to find the specified level in the MultiIndex names, leading to a KeyError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include checking if the specified level exists in the MultiIndex names before trying to get its index, and handling the case where the level is not found gracefully to avoid the KeyError. Additionally, there might be a need to revise the logic of how levels are handled in the function to ensure it is consistent with the MultiIndex structure.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs if i in index.names]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, the `clocs` are filtered to only include those that exist in the MultiIndex names, ensuring that levels that are not present in the MultiIndex names are excluded. This change addresses the potential KeyError caused by trying to get the index of a level that does not exist in the MultiIndex names.
