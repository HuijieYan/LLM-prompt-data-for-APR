##  Bug's Cause

The bug is being caused by the `_get_level_number` method which is being called in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The `_get_level_number` is raising a `KeyError` because it is not able to find the provided level in the `self.names` list. The issue is that the level `('A', 'a')` is causing problems because it is a tuple, while the `_get_level_number` method is expecting a single level name.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function. It should handle the input level correctly before calling the `_get_level_number` method. The fix involves identifying whether the level provided is a tuple or a single value. If it's a tuple, we need to convert it appropriately to support the required behavior. 

To accomplish this, we'll modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to accept the input level correctly. If the level is a tuple, we will convert it to a single value using the appropriate logic before calling `_get_level_number`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert the input clocs to a list if it's a tuple
    clocs = list(clocs) if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else clocs

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```
This code checks if the input `clocs` is a tuple. If it is, it converts it to a list. Then, for each level in `clocs`, it checks if it's a tuple and if so, processes it accordingly before calling the `_get_level_number` method.

## Updated Code

Here's the updated `_unstack_multiple` function after the bug fix:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert the input clocs to a list if it's a tuple
    clocs = list(clocs) if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else clocs

    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple levels to single levels
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this fix, the function should now handle tuple levels correctly and prevent the `KeyError` being raised in the `_get_level_number` method.

This updated code should correct the bug and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
