After analyzing the buggy function and its related functions, as well as the failing test and error message from the GitHub issue, it is clear that the bug is occurring due to an issue with the `_get_level_number` function within the MultiIndex class.

The `_get_level_number` function is being called in the `_unstack_multiple` function, which is related to the unstacking operation used in the failing test cases. The failing test cases provide inputs that lead to the `_unstack_multiple` function calling `_get_level_number`, resulting in a KeyError or ValueError being raised.

The problem seems to be that the `_get_level_number` function is not able to handle tuple names properly when dealing with MultiIndexes.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names properly. This may involve avoiding the use of tuple names when calling the `_get_level_number` function.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        # Extract the level names from the tuple names and use the extracted names for clocs
        level_names = [name[0] if isinstance(name, tuple) else name for name in index.names]
        clocs = [level_names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

With this modification, the `_unstack_multiple` function will properly handle MultiIndexes with tuple names and the failing test case should pass. Additionally, this fix should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

After making this change, the corrected function will comply with the requirements mentioned and resolve the bug that causes the failing test case.

This corrected code should address the issue and ensure that the function works as expected.
