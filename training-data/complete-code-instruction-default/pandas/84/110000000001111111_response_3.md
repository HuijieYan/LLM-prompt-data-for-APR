The issue appears to be related to the `clocs` variable, which is a tuple in the failing tests. The function, however, seems to be expecting the first element of this tuple to be a level name, which causes it to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_level_number` is trying to access the level number by index, rather than by name. This is evident from the GitHub issue, where the KeyError indicates that the level "A" is not found, which suggests that it is being interpreted as an index rather than a name.

To resolve this issue, the function `_get_level_number` needs to be modified to handle the case where the input is a tuple of names. Additionally, the rest of the code should be updated to handle a tuple of level names appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[index.names.index(name)] for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if index.names[i] not in clocs]

    ccodes = [index.codes[index.names.index(name)] for name in clocs]
    cnames = [name for name in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
}
```

This updated version of the function should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report by properly handling a tuple of level names.
