The issue seems to be occurring while trying to unstack a MultiIndex with a mixed type name in the `df.unstack()` method. The actual error message is related to the `MultiIndex._get_level_number()` method and the error states that "A" is not found in the list, leading to a KeyError.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_unstack_multiple` fails to handle the case of tuple name correctly and does not retrieve the level number for the tuple names in the MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case of tuple names in a MultiIndex. We should adjust the logic to correctly handle both single and tuple names in the MultiIndex while obtaining the level numbers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs_new = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            loc = tuple(index.names.index(n) for n in loc)
        else:
            loc = index._get_level_number(loc)
        clocs_new.append(loc)

    clocs = clocs_new

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This updated function will correctly handle the case of both single and tuple names in the MultiIndex and obtain the level numbers accordingly.

This corrected code aims to pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output variable information, ensuring that the code performs the unstack operation correctly for a MultiIndex with mixed type names.

Please note that there might be variations in the correct solution based on the specific use case for the function and the broader context of the codebase.
