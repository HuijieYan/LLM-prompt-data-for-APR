The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is responsible for unstacking the given DataFrame in Pandas. The error message indicates that the function is encountering issues when trying to retrieve the level number of the index.

Looking at the error messages, the issue occurs when the `_get_level_number` function is called, and it tries to get the level number for a given level. The error suggests that the 'A' level is not found, leading to a KeyError.

Based on the error message and the code, it seems like the issue is with the way the function tries to get the level number for the index. It fails to identify the correct level number, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix this bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Check if the index contains the level before accessing its level number.
2. Handle the scenario where the level is not found gracefully, without raising a KeyError or ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else -1 for i in clocs]

    if -1 in clocs:
        raise ValueError("One of the specified levels not found in the index")

    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

In the above correction, the `clocs` list is modified to store the level number if it is found in the index names, and -1 otherwise. Then, it checks for the presence of -1 in `clocs` to ensure that all the specified levels are found in the index. If any level is not found, it raises a ValueError.

This approach ensures that the function handles scenarios where the level is not found in the index, thereby addressing the error described in the failing tests.
