The issue is caused by the `_get_level_number` method when a tuple of names is passed as the level parameter of the `unstack` method.

The problematic function is `_unstack_multiple`, and the issue lies in the line that retrieves the level number for each name in the `clocs` list: `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The error occurs when passing a tuple of names instead of a single name to the `_get_level_number` method.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle a tuple of names. Additionally, modifications may be needed to handle different scenarios of input parameters based on the observations from the GitHub issue and runtime information.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for i in clocs:
        if isinstance(i, tuple):
            cloc_numbers.append(index.names.index(i))
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(i))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # Ensure to make necessary adjustments based on the specific input scenario.

    return unstacked
```

The corrected function checks if the `clocs` parameter contains a tuple of names. If so, it retrieves the corresponding level numbers and proceeds with the unstacking process accordingly.

This corrected version should handle the multi indexed unstacking with tuple names, as demonstrated in the GitHub issue and the specific input cases provided.
