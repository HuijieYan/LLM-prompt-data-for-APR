**Bug Analysis:**

The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when it tries to unstack a multi-index with tuple names. The function fails to handle the multi-index correctly and results in a KeyError.

The root cause of the bug seems to be that the function is not properly handling the tuple names when unstacking the multi-index.

**Approach for Fixing the Bug:**

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be updated to properly handle multi-index with tuple names. Specifically, it needs to correctly identify the levels and codes of the multi-index and then perform the unstacking operation based on that information.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Determine the level numbers for the given clocs
    cloc_numbers = [data.index._get_level_number(c) if isinstance(c, tuple) else data.index.names.index(c) for c in clocs]

    # Determine the remaining levels
    rloc_numbers = [i for i in range(data.index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Get the levels and codes for the clocs
    clevels = [data.index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [data.index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    
    # Get the levels and codes for the rlocs
    rlevels = [data.index.levels[i] for i in rloc_numbers]
    rcodes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in rloc_numbers]
    rnames = [data.index.names[i] for i in rloc_numbers]

    # Perform unstacking based on the above information
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # If the result is a Series, update the index with new_columns
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        new_columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(unstacked.index, names=cnames)
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        # If the result is a DataFrame, update the columns with new_columns
        new_columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(unstacked.columns, names=cnames)
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function properly determines the levels and codes of the multi-index and unstacks it accordingly.

After applying the fix, the function should successfully handle the unstacking of multi-index with tuple names as demonstrated in the expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the `_unstack_multiple` function operate as expected.

Please update the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file with the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function.
