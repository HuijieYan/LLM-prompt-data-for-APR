The issue here is that the `clocs` variable is incorrectly assigned in the `_unstack_multiple` function of the `pandas.core.reshape.reshape` module. The `clocs` variable is expected to contain the level numbers, but it's currently being assigned the level names instead.

To fix this bug, the `clocs` variable should be assigned the level numbers using the `index._get_level_number()` method. Additionally, the `rlocs` variable is expected to contain the remaining level numbers, so it needs to be updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]  # Fix: Get level numbers instead of names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]  # Update rlocs accordingly

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this fix, the `clocs` variable is correctly assigned the level numbers, ensuring that the unstacking operation processes the correct levels.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue. It correctly handles the unstacking of multi-index dataframes with tuple names and ensures that the test case `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` passes as expected.
