The `index._get_level_number(i)` method is causing an error in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The failing tests indicate that an error is occurring while handling the level number for a MultiIndex.

The potential error is occurring in the section of the code where `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.

The issue arises because the `index._get_level_number` method is trying to find the name of the level in the MultiIndex, but the level is specified as a tuple in the failing test. This results in errors such as `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` and `KeyError: 'Level A not found`.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuples as level names in a MultiIndex. Additionally, we need to ensure that we are correctly handling the level names and numbers throughout the function.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex
from pandas.core.reshape.reshape import unstack
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        level_numbers = []
        for cloc in clocs:
            if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
                level_number = index.names.index(cloc)
            else:
                level_number = cloc
            level_numbers.append(level_number)
    else:
        level_numbers = clocs

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return unstack(data, level_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)
```
