The problem in the function `_unstack_multiple` is that it is trying to use a tuple of names as the argument for unstacking the MultiIndex, which is causing the error. The expected behavior should be that when unstacking, only integer level or level name should be used as arguments.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case when the argument `clocs` is a tuple of names. We can convert the tuple of names to a list of level names before processing it.

Here's the corrected code for the function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

With this fix, the function will be able to handle the case when a tuple of names is passed as the argument for unstacking the MultiIndex.

This corrected code should pass the failing tests and also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug. This fix will allow users to use a tuple of names to unstack a MultiIndex without encountering an error.
