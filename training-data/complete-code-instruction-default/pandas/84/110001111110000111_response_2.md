The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is causing issues when unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names. The error is raised in the `_get_level_number` function, which tries to get the level number of a given level. However, the code uses the `index._get_level_number` method to get the level numbers, which is the source of the error. The failing tests indicate a `KeyError` when level 'A' is not found, and the error message on GitHub issue also confirms this.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function and use the `index._get_level_number` method correctly to avoid the `KeyError`. We should also handle tuple names properly when unstacking the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(name) if isinstance(name, tuple) else index.names.index(name) for name in clocs]

    if clocs == list(range(index.nlevels)):
        # All levels are unstacked
        return data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)

    dummy_index = index.droplevel(clocs)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function checks if all levels are unstacked and returns the unstacked data directly in that case. It also handles tuple names correctly when getting the level numbers.

This corrected code should pass the failing tests and resolve the issues reported in the GitHub issue.
