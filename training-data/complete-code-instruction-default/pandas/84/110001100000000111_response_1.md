The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.

The bug's cause is that the `clocs` variable is being used as a string in the function `index._get_level_number(i)`, but it should instead be an integer representing the level number.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that `clocs` is an integer before passing it to the `index._get_level_number(i)` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return unstacked
```
The correction ensures that `clocs` is converted to an integer if it's a tuple before being used in the `index._get_level_number(i)` function. This fix should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
