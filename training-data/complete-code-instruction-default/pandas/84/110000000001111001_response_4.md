The bug in the function lies in the handling of nested indices when unstacking the data. 

The discrepancies in the actual and expected variables suggest that the function is incorrectly unstacking the data, leading to incorrect reshaping and naming of the columns.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the nested indices and unstack the data accordingly, ensuring that the reshaping and naming of the columns is correct.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the levels and codes for the specified clocs
    levels = [data.index.levels[data.index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]
    codes = [data.index.codes[data.index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]

    # Unstack the data
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    # Flatten the multi-level columns to a single level
    unstacked.columns = unstacked.columns.map(lambda x: '_'.join(filter(None, x)))

    return unstacked
```

The corrected function properly handles the nested indices and unstacks the data accordingly, ensuring that the reshaping and naming of the columns is correct.
