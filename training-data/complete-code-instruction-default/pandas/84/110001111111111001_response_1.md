The bug is in the `_unstack_multiple` function in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The function is expecting `clocs` to be a list of level numbers, but it receives a list of level names or tuples of level names. This is causing the error in the `_get_level_number` function.

The `unstack` method with a tuple of level names is calling the `_unstack_multiple` function, which is not handling the tuple correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function so that it correctly handles tuples of level names. We can use the `get_level_number` method to get the level numbers for the given level names.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index.get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function will correctly handle both lists and tuples of level names, and the failing test cases should pass.

The corrected code ensures that the `clocs` input parameter is handled correctly, and it satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
