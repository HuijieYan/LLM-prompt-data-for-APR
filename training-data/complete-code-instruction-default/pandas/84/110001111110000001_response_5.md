The issue in the provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is occurring due to the way it's handling the levels and names of the MultiIndex. The function is not correctly obtaining the level numbers for the given levels and is causing the `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` and `KeyError: 'Level A not found` errors. 

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly obtains the level numbers and handles the MultiIndex properly.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to update the code that extracts the level numbers and reconstructs the MultiIndex to ensure that it is done correctly for both single and multi-level indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Extract the level numbers
    clevels = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]
    
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    new_levels = rlevels + [index.levels[i] for i in clevels]
    new_codes = data.index.codes

    for i, c in enumerate(clevels):
        new_codes = new_codes[:c] + [np.zeros(len(new_codes[0]), dtype=int) + i] + new_codes[c:]

    new_index = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + [index.names[i] for i in clevels])

    unstacked = data.copy()
    unstacked.index = new_index
    unstacked = unstacked.unstack(list(range(len(clevels))), fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function will ensure that it handles the MultiIndex correctly and should pass the failing tests.
