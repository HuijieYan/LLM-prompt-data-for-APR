The issue arises due to the usage of tuples as names for the MultiIndex. This causes problems in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class and results in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the scenario where tuples are used as names in the MultiIndex.

The corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.names.index(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This fix modifies the `clocs` list comprehension in the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle tuples as names in the MultiIndex. It uses the `index.names.index(i)` method if the name is a tuple, otherwise, it falls back to `index._get_level_number(i)`.

With this modification, the function should be able to handle the scenario where tuple names are used in the MultiIndex and should pass the failing test cases. This fix also addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
