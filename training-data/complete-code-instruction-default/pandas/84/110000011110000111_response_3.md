Upon analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, as well as the error message and the GitHub issue, it appears that the error is occurring in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class. The function seems to be unable to handle the tuple names in the multi-index, leading to a KeyError.

The cause of the bug seems to be the `_get_level_number` method not being able to handle tuple names in the multi-index, which results in the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the tuple names in the multi-index. We also need to ensure that the `clocs` and `rlocs` are correctly calculated and processed.

One possible approach to fixing the bug would be to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the tuple names in the multi-index by extracting the levels and codes for each level of the multi-index correctly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `clocs` and `rlocs` are correctly calculated based on the multi-index structure.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract index and levels
    index = data.index
    levels = index.levels
    codes = index.codes

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    # ...

```

With this corrected function, it should now be able to handle tuple names in the multi-index and pass the failing test. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
