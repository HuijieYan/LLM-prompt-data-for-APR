The problematic function is `_unstack_multiple` which is used in the `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` test cases. The error occurs at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, indicating an issue with getting the level number for a given index.

The root cause of the bug is that the `clocs` variable contains a tuple of level names, but the function `_get_level_number` expects a single level name. This causes the function to raise a `ValueError` or `KeyError` because a tuple is not found when searching for a single level name.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way `clocs` are processed and handle cases where `clocs` are tuples.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Check if clocs is a tuple
        clocs = [(index._get_level_number(i[0]), i[1]) for i in clocs]  # Get level number for each tuple value
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle cases where `clocs` is a tuple, and the corrected function should pass the failing test cases.
