The error occurred when the test fails because the `_unstack_multiple` function uses the `level` value directly to convert to `clocs`, while `clocs` is expected to be a list of level numbers. You need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function so that it takes a tuple of names and converts them into a list of level numbers before processing them.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert names to level numbers
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

You should also remove the following import from the buggy function to avoid a merge conflict:

```python
from pandas.core.reshape.util import get_group_index, compress_group_index, decons_obs_group_ids
```

After making these changes, re-run the failing test cases to ensure that the issue has been resolved. If the tests pass, you can then create a pull request on the GitHub repository for pandas.
