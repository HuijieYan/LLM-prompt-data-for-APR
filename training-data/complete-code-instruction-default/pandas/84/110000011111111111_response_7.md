The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an error in the code where it tries to handle multiple levels in a MultiIndex. The error occurs when attempting to get the level number of the provided input. The function incorrectly handles the tuple names in the MultiIndex and raises a KeyError instead of properly obtaining the level number.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified to handle the tuple names correctly and obtain the level number in the MultiIndex. This will involve correcting the logic for identifying the level number and handling the tuple names in the index.

Additionally, the corrected function should maintain consistency with the expected input/output variable information provided and pass the failing test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    levels = [index._get_level_number(level) if isinstance(level, tuple) else level for level in clocs]

    if len(levels) == 1:
        result = data.unstack(levels[0], fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        result = data.unstack(levels, fill_value=fill_value)

    return result
```

The corrected function handles both single level and multiple levels in the MultiIndex. It utilizes the `_get_level_number` method to obtain the level number, and then unstacks the data accordingly.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases and successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
