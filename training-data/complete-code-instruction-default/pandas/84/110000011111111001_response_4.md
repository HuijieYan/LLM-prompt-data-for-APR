The buggy function, `_unstack_multiple`, is failing due to an error in the calculation of the indices and columns during unstacking. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the level 'A' not being found in the MultiIndex.

The root cause of the problem lies in how the function handles the index and column manipulation. It incorrectly tries to extract the level number for the specified level, and in doing so, ends up raising a ValueError or KeyError.

The correct approach to fixing this would be to use the correct pandas API and methods to perform the unstacking operation on the DataFrame. The function should handle MultiIndex and unstack operations properly, without directly manipulating the indices and columns like it is currently doing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, the function uses the `unstack` method directly on the DataFrame `data` with the specified `clocs`. This leverages pandas' built-in capabilities for hierarchical indexing and unstacking, and avoids the direct manipulation of indices and columns.

This corrected version should resolve the issues and pass the failing test cases.
