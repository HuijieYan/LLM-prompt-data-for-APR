The problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to unstack a MultiIndex. However, it fails to retrieve the level numbers correctly and this results in a `ValueError` or `KeyError`.

The function tries to handle hierarchical columns but it has some issues and doesn't deal with them properly. This is causing the errors. The function is also trying to handle both Series and DataFrame, which leads to complexity and handling errors differently for each case.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle hierarchical columns and simplify the logic for handling both Series and DataFrame.

The corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    if not rlevels:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(index, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [index],
            names=[name if i < len(rlevels) else "__placeholder__" for i, name in enumerate(index.names)] +
                  [index.names[i] for i in clocs],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code handles the unstacking of MultiIndex without trying to deal with hierarchical columns explicitly. It simplifies the logic by unstacking the DataFrame directly instead of unstacking the MultiIndex twice in different ways depending on the input and handles both Series and DataFrame in a similar manner.

The corrected code should pass both failing tests.
