The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class, where it raises a `ValueError` since the value 'A' is not found in the list of names. This method is called from the `_unstack_multiple` function to transform the input `clocs` into level numbers for unstacking. However, the `clocs` variable is a tuple that contains a mix of integers and level names. As a result, the level name 'A' is not found, leading to the `ValueError` being raised.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle mixed types in the `clocs` tuple. We can achieve this by checking the type of each element in the `clocs` tuple and converting the level names to level numbers using the `_get_level_number` method. After that, we can use the level numbers for unstacking.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handling mixed types in the clocs tuple
    cloc_numbers = []
    index = data.index
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, str):
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(loc)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This modified code will handle the mixed types in the `clocs` tuple and use the level numbers for unstacking.

Please ensure to run the failing test cases to validate that the fixed function now passes the previously failing tests.
