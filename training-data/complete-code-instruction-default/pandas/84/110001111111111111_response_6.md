The issue is caused by the `_get_level_number` method in the `pandas.core.indexes.multi.MultiIndex` class. When the `unstack` method is called, it attempts to locate the level number for a tuple of names, leading to a KeyError due to 'A' not being found in the list of names.

The potential error location within the `_unstack_multiple` function is identified to be the line where it calls `index._get_level_number(i)`.

To fix this issue, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle the case where `clocs` contains tuple names. The logic should be updated to handle both single level names and tuple names correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    new_clocs = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in cloc]
        else:
            cloc = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        new_clocs.append(cloc)

    clocs = new_clocs

    # rest of the function remains unchanged...
}
```

With this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to handle both single level names and tuple names correctly, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub thread.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
