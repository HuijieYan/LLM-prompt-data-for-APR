The root of the problem is in the function `_unstack_multiple`, which is causing the error when unstacking a multi-index. The error is caused by a check that tries to get the index level number for the specified level in `clocs`. This check is causing a KeyError because the level passed to the `_get_level_number` method is a tuple, and the method is not handling hierarchical columns yet.

The potential error location is in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The bug is caused by the inability of the function to handle hierarchical columns, which results in a KeyError when trying to get the level number for the specified level. This is consistent with the information from the GitHub issue, where unstacking a multi-index with tuple names fails with a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle hierarchical columns properly so that it can get the correct level number for unstacking.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if index.nlevels > 1:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, (int, str)) else i for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding a check to handle hierarchical columns and ensuring that the level number is obtained for unstacking, the corrected function should now be able to successfully unstack a multi-index with tuple names and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
