The problem is occurring in the _get_level_number function when trying to find the index of a level that is specified as a tuple. This is causing a ValueError followed by a KeyError.

The bug seems to be related to handling multi-index when the level parameter is given as a tuple. The problematic function _unstack_multiple is unable to handle the tuple level correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _unstack_multiple function to properly handle an input level that is a tuple when dealing with multi-index data.

Here is the corrected code for the _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

With this update, the _unstack_multiple function will be able to properly handle the tuple input for the level parameter and avoid the ValueError and KeyError that were occurring before. This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
