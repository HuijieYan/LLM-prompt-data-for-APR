The bug is likely caused by an error while trying to get the level number for a MultiIndex. The error message 'Level A not found' suggests that the code is trying to access a level that does not exist in the MultiIndex.

The bug is caused by the `_get_level_number` function, especially when it is called to get the level number for a MultiIndex, which it doesn't handle correctly.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to handle MultiIndexes correctly and avoid the KeyError. This can be done by ensuring that the level names are correctly processed and the code properly handles MultiIndexes in both Series and DataFrame objects.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same

    return unstacked
```

This modified function checks if the index is a MultiIndex and then ensures that the level names are correctly processed. This should fix the bug described in the GitHub issue.
