1. The buggy function is related to unstacking a Series with a MultiIndex. The GitHub issue is about unstacking a Series with a MultiIndex and encountering a KeyError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it tries to get the level number from the index with the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.

3. (a). The buggy function tries to unstack a MultiIndex, but encounters an error when trying to get the level number.
   (b). The GitHub issue states that attempting to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names results in a KeyError, specifically, "Level A not found."

4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to properly handle the case when tuple names are present in the multi-index, and address the KeyError that arises when attempting to get the level number.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

This corrected function includes a check for whether the level is a string (tuple name) before trying to get the level number. By including the condition `if isinstance(i, str)`, the function can handle the case when tuple names are present in the MultiIndex.
