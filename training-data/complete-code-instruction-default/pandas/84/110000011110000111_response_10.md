The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is causing a KeyError due to the way it handles multi-index levels. The error is occurring in the `_get_level_number` method of the `index` object, where it fails to find the level named "A".

The failing test functions `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` are calling the `unstack` method on a DataFrame with specific multi-index configurations and failing due to the error in `_unstack_multiple`.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem with the `unstack` method on a Series with a multi-level index.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle multi-index levels properly and avoid the KeyError. We also need to ensure that the fixed function passes the failing test and resolves the issue described in the GitHub report.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):  # Handle multi-level index names
            loc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in loc]
            cloc_numbers.append(tuple(loc_numbers))
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    # ... (rest of the function code)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function should address the KeyError issue and properly handle multi-level index names. It should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub report.
