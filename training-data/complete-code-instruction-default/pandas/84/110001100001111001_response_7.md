The potential error in the buggy function is likely due to the incorrect handling of hierarchical indices. The function attempts to manipulate and unstack the data based on the input column locations, but it does not properly handle the hierarchy of the indices which leads to incorrect restructuring of the data.

To fix this bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified to correctly handle hierarchical indices. This can be achieved by using the `data.unstack()` method, which is specifically designed to handle hierarchical indices.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```

By using the `data.unstack()` method, we can ensure that the hierarchical indices are properly handled when unstacking the data. This corrected code should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing test cases.
