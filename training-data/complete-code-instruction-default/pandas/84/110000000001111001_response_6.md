The issue seems to be occurring in the section of the code where a new MultiIndex is being created. The code is not creating the new index with the correct levels, names, and codes, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that the new MultiIndex is created correctly with the expected levels, names, and codes. Additionally, you need to handle the conditional statements regarding the type of input (Series or DataFrame) appropriately.

Here's the corrected function that should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided:

```python
# corrected function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains the same as the original function

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
