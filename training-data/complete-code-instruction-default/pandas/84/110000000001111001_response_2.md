The bug in the function seems to be related to the unstacking and re-stacking of the data when hierarchical columns are present. The function is not handling the hierarchical columns correctly, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

The potential error location within the function is the logic for handling hierarchical columns, as well as the creation of new levels, names, and codes for the unstacked data.

The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect handling of hierarchical columns and the reconstruction of the codes. This is evident from the discrepancies in the actual and expected values of the variables related to hierarchical columns.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Properly handling hierarchical columns within the function.
2. Ensuring that the reconstruction of codes for hierarchical columns is done correctly.
3. Correctly setting the new levels, names, and codes for the unstacked data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        unstacked = data
        for cloc in clocs:
            unstacked = unstacked.unstack(cloc, fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked

    # Handle regular columns
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked
```

This corrected function should properly handle both hierarchical and regular columns and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
