### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_get_level_number` function is unable to handle tuple input for the `level`. It should be able to handle tuples when the index is a MultiIndex. 

### Reason
The `_get_level_number` function only checks if the input level is an integer and raises a ValueError if it is not. It does not handle the case when the level is a tuple, which is the cause of the KeyError and ValueError raised during the failing test.

### Possible approaches
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuple input for the level parameter and return the level numbers for each level in the tuple. This will ensure that it works for both single levels and tuples.
2. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to pass the level numbers to the `_get_level_number` function instead of the level itself.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> Union[int, List[int]]:
    if isinstance(level, int):
        return self.names.index(level)
    elif isinstance(level, tuple):
        return [self.names.index(l) for l in level]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Level {level} not found")

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = index._get_level_number(clocs)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

With these changes, the `_unstack_multiple` function will be able to properly handle tuple input for levels and should pass the failing test cases.
