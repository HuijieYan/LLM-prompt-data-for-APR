1. The buggy function is a method for unstacking a pandas DataFrame or Series with multiple levels of a MultiIndex. The GitHub issue is related to unstacking a Series with a MultiIndex with tuple names, where it fails with a KeyError. The error occurs when trying to get the level number of a specific level name within the MultiIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the line:
   `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`
   This is where the function tries to get the level number for each level name provided in `clocs`, and it is likely causing the KeyError issue.

3. The bug's cause is due to the function not properly handling MultiIndex with tuple names, leading to a KeyError during the unstacking process. The GitHub issue provides a clear example where the function fails when unstacking a Series with a MultiIndex that has tuple names.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to:
   (a). Adjust the way the function handles MultiIndex with tuple names, ensuring that it correctly identifies the level number for each level name.
   (b). Refactor the function's logic to handle the unstacking process of MultiIndex with tuple names, addressing the specific KeyError issue reported in the GitHub.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # ... existing import and other function definitions ...

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    ccodes = [index.get_level_values(level).values for level in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[level] for level in clocs]
    clevels = [index.levels[level] for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        dummy_index = pd.Index(index, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [index.levels[level] for level in clocs],
            codes=rlocs + list(range(len(clocs))),
            names=rnames + ['__placeholder__']
        )

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [clevels[i] for i in range(len(clocs))]
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = ccodes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = list(unstacked.columns.levels)
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstacked.columns.codes[0]] + ccodes

    new_columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays(new_codes, names=new_names)
    if isinstance(unstacked, pd.Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
This corrected code addresses the issue by properly identifying the level number for each level name, handling MultiIndex with tuple names, and restructuring the unstacking process. The problem reported in the GitHub issue should now be resolved with this fix.
