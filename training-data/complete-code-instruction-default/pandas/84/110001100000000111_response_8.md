The potential error location within the problematic function is at line 317, specifically in the list comprehension where the `_get_level_number` method is called for each element in the `clocs` list. This is the cause of the KeyError that is being raised.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function is assuming that all elements in the `clocs` list are valid level names or numbers in the index. However, the code does not handle the case where the level name is a tuple, as seen in the GitHub issue. This leads to a KeyError being raised when trying to find the level number for a tuple name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle both single level names/numbers and tuples of level names.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if all(isinstance(loc, tuple) for loc in clocs):
        clevel_numbers = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]
    else:
        clevel_numbers = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This function now checks if all elements in `clocs` are tuples, and if so, it retrieves the level numbers using the tuple names. If not, it retrieves the level number for the single name/number. This modification allows the function to handle both single level names/numbers and tuples of level names, satisfying the GitHub issue.
