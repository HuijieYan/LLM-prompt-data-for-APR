The buggy function is _unstack_multiple, and it is using the function _get_level_number to retrieve the level number. The error message indicates that it's trying to retrieve 'A' from a MultiIndex, which is not appropriate. This is causing a ValueError. The failing test functions are trying to unstack a MultiIndex, which is not being handled properly by the _unstack_multiple function.

To fix the bug:
1. In the _unstack_multiple function, we need to check if the index is a MultiIndex and handle it differently. MultiIndex needs to be handled separately because it has multiple levels and codes.
2. We should also properly handle the case when there are no rlocs.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        # Handle MultiIndex separately
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
        return unstacked

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same...
    # ...
```

This fixed function should now handle both regular Index and MultiIndex correctly and should pass the failing test.
