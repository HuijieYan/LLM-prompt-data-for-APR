The problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the level 'A'. The function is trying to get the level number, but it's failing to find the 'A' in the list of names. This suggests that the level 'A' is not correctly defined or accessed within the MultiIndex.

The bug is likely caused by an issue with level identification and access within the MultiIndex, leading to errors when trying to unstack the DataFrame.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the construction of the MultiIndex and ensure that levels such as 'A' are properly defined.
2. Verify that the level 'A' is being accessed correctly within the MultiIndex.
3. Handle edge cases and ensure that the function can handle different types of multi-index configurations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Changed to use the index attribute of the DataFrame
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```
With the above changes, the function should now correctly handle the access and identification of levels within the MultiIndex, thus resolving the error.
