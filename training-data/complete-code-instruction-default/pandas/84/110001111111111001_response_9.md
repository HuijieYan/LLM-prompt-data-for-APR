### Bug

The issue lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function. In this function, the `clocs` parameter is being used to get the level number for the index. However, when the `clocs` parameter is a tuple, the function is trying to directly get the level number without checking if it's a tuple or a single value.

### Cause

The `_get_level_number` function is expecting a single value to get the level number, but it's receiving a tuple instead. This is causing it to throw a `ValueError` and a subsequent `KeyError`.

### Possible approaches for fixing the bug
We need to modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle the case when `clocs` is passed as a tuple, as it should get the level numbers for all the levels in the tuple.

Additionally, the subsequent code in the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be updated to handle the case when `clocs` is a tuple.

### Corrected code

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Modified block to handle tuple type for clocs
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # ... rest of the code ...
```
