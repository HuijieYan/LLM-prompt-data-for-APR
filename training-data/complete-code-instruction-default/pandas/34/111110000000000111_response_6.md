1. The buggy function is part of the TimeGrouper class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The GitHub issue is related to a problem with the groupby function when using a daily frequency, specifically on a long clock-change day in Cuba where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the calculation and handling of the bin edges and labels, especially in cases where there are ambiguous timestamps such as on a clock-change day.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the way the function calculates and assigns bin edges and labels, especially when dealing with ambiguous timestamps. The GitHub issue points out that on a clock-change day in Cuba, the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError, indicating that the function is not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve adjusting the logic for handling ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that bin edges and labels are correctly assigned, taking into account the potential for ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # other class methods and attributes

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",  # Change the ambiguous parameter to 'infer'
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the ambiguous parameter in the date_range function is changed to 'infer' based on the suggestion in the GitHub issue. This change should help in handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, resolving the issue described in the GitHub problem description.
