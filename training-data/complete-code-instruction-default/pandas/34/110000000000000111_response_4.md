1. The function `_get_time_bins` is part of the pandas library and is related to a GitHub issue where the groupby function with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba. The issue arises when the timestamp is ambiguous due to the clock change, and the groupby function does not handle it properly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the generation of bins and labels, especially in the case of an ambiguous timestamp.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function fails to account for the ambiguity in the timestamp caused by the clock change.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug would include properly handling ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that the labels and bins are generated correctly, and addressing the specific issues related to the clock change in Cuba.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected function ensures that the handling of ambiguous timestamps is done correctly, addressing the specific issue reported in the GitHub bug. It now properly handles the generation of bins and labels, taking into account the ambiguity in the timestamp caused by the clock change.
