The potential error of the buggy function is that it is invoking `date_range()` as `binner = labels = date_range(...)` and not initializing the required `DatatimeIndex` index using `date_range` which is causing this "AmbiguousTimeError". 

To fix the bug, we need to create a `DateTimeIndex` using the `date_range` with the time frequency and `ax.tz` (timezone), as `date_range` returns a `DatetimeIndex` with the start and end values. This will ensure that the timezone information is retained while creating the frequency of the bins.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... same as before

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
      
        binner_labels_index = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=ax[0], end=ax[-1], tz=ax.tz)
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, binner_labels_index.values, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
        bins_data = ax.take(bins, is_copy=True)

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = bins_data[1:]
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
     
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return bins_data, bins, labels
```

With these changes, the test is expected to pass and the error is mitigated based on the following reasoning:

1. The `date_range` is used to obtain the frequency of time bins and the index on `binner_labels_index` is created using the start and end dates, with the specified timezone information retained.
2. `lib.generate_bins_dt64` is used to generate bins using the adjusted bin edges, and ensure the assigned bins adhere to the closed parameter by resolving non-ambiguous times using the `hasnans` parameter.
3. After generating the bins, the labels are adjusted based on the conditions for the closed and label parameters, taking into account the possibility of NaN in the bins.
4. The correct number of labels is ensured by comparing the length of bins and labels and adjusting the labels accordingly.
5. With these corrections, the AmbiguousTimeError from the failing test is expected to be resolved and the test to pass successfully.
