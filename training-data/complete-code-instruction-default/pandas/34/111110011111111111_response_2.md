The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when the `date_range` method is used. This error occurs when the clock change day in Cuba leads to a repeated timestamp at midnight, resulting in the ambiguous local time. The bug is likely in the way the labels are generated and assigned in the `date_range` method call.

The potential error location is identified as the handling of time bins and labels, which is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when generating the date range.

The bug causes the function to fail in handling the ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The expected output is the grouping to return three groups, one for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), with the group for the 4th of November to be labelled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and contain the 25 hourly data points for that day. The provided `bins` and `labels` values don't match the expected output, indicating the bug in the function's logic.

To fix the bug, the problematic function `_get_time_bins` needs to be modified to handle the ambiguous time on the clock change day. We need to ensure that the labels are generated and assigned correctly in the `date_range` method call to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        bins = np.insert(bins, 0, 0)  # Insert a placeholder at the start

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles the generation and assignment of labels in the `date_range` method call to correctly handle the ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba. This code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and, if executed, successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
