There are several issues identified with the provided code and the GitHub issue. 

1. The problem is related to handling ambiguous time on clock change days, particularly in Cuba, and the bug causes the `groupby` function to raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to how the timestamps on clock change days are being handled. 

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the `date_range` function not properly handling the ambiguous time on clock change days. This leads to the `groupby` function raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The GitHub issue also provides a code sample, problem description, expected output, and version information.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug might include updating the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle ambiguous time on clock change days, specifically in the context of the provided GitHub issue. This may involve using a different method to handle timestamps on clock change days, such as using a custom method to check for and handle ambiguous time.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code should handle the ambiguous time on clock change days and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
