The issue is related to handling the time change transition on the day of the clock change in the `groupby` with a daily frequency.

The potential cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the time transition on the day of the clock change in the `_get_time_bins` function. It can be inferred from the failing test and the error message that there is an AmbiguousTimeError raised due to the ambiguous timestamp at midnight local time on the clock change day in Cuba.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be updated to handle the daylight saving time transition more accurately.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly handle the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change by specifying the ambiguous and nonexistent arguments in the `date_range` function. The `ambiguous` parameter can be set to 'NaT' and the `nonexistent` parameter can be set to 'shift_forward' to handle the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # ... (previous code)

    binner, bin_edges, labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # handle ambiguous time as NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # shift nonexistent time forward
    )

    # ... (remaining code)
```

With this fix, the `_get_time_bins` function should now handle the daylight saving time transition correctly and pass the failing test. It should also satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Please replace the original `_get_time_bins` function in the `pandas/core/resample.py` with the corrected code provided above. This should resolve the bug and address the AmbiguousTimeError issue reported on GitHub.
