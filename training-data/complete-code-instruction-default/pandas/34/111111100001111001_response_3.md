The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` which is implemented within the `TimeGrouper` class. It seems to be failing in generating the bins and labels based on the given `ax` input. This is most likely due to the incorrect calculation of the `last` value and mismatch in frequencies.

To fix the bug, the calculation for `last` value needs to be modified to account for the time offsets based on the frequency. Additionally, the `labels` and `binner` generation logic seems to be incorrect which should be modified.

Corrected code for the problematic function is as follow:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        # ... existing code ...
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max() + pd.Timedelta(self.freq.value - 1, unit='ns'), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)

        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # ... existing code ...
        
        return binner, bin_edges, labels
```
