The error is caused by the incorrect computation of the `last` timestamp in the `_get_time_bins` function. The timestamp for the end of the last bin should be generated from the maximum timestamp in the index, but this process is currently resulting in an "AmbiguousTimeError" due to the incorrect computation of the `last` timestamp.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `last` timestamp is generated correctly based on the maximum timestamp in the index, and the `label` and `closed` variables are appropriately handled to determine the correct last bin boundary.

The fixed code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max() + self.freq
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        label=self.label,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code ensures that the `last` timestamp is correctly generated based on the maximum timestamp in the index and takes into account the `label` and `closed` parameters to determine the correct last bin boundary.

With this corrected code, the provided failing test should pass without raising the "AmbiguousTimeError" and the results will match the expected output.
