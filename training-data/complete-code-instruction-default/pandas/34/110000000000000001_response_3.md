# The buggy function is _get_time_bins, which is supposed to handle time bins for a given axis.
The potential error location is in the section where the labels are being adjusted based on the closed and label parameters.

The bug's cause is the potential mismatch in the length of the bins and labels due to incorrect adjustments based on the closed and label parameters.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately adjust the labels based on the closed and label parameters, ensuring that the length matches the bins. Additionally, we need to handle the case where there are NaN values in the axis.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    # if we have more bins than labels, adjust bins
    elif len(bins) > len(labels):
        bins = bins[: len(labels)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code:
- The labels are adjusted to match the length of the bins, handling the case where there are more bins or labels.
- A condition is added to adjust the bins if there are more bins than labels.
- The handling of NaN values in the axis is improved.

With these changes, the buggy function should now handle time bins accurately and prevent the mismatch in the length of bins and labels.
