The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be caused by the incorrect calculation of bin edges and labels. The `bin_edges` calculated from the `_adjust_bin_edges` function seems to be incorrect, which results in the incorrect calculation of `bins`.

To fix the bug:
1. It seems that the problem is with the calculation of `bin_edges` in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function or its usage in the `_get_time_bins` function.
2. We need to ensure that the `bin_edges` are calculated correctly in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function and used appropriately in the `_get_time_bins` function to generate the `bins`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)  # Corrected usage of bin_edges

    # Recalculate bins using the corrected bin_edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `bin_edges` calculated in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function are used in the `_get_time_bins` function to generate the `bins` appropriately. This should resolve the bug and produce the expected output based on the provided input information.
