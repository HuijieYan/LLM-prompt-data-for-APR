The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the use of the `date_range` function, as it may not be imported or available within the scope of the buggy function. Additionally, the method `_adjust_bin_edges` is being called without the `self` parameter, which indicates that this method needs to be called from an instance of a class.

The bug's cause is likely that the `date_range` function is not being properly imported or accessed within the scope of the `_get_time_bins` function. Additionally, the method `_adjust_bin_edges` should be called from an instance of a class, but it is not being passed the `self` parameter.

Approaches for fixing the bug would include properly importing the `date_range` function, ensuring that the `_adjust_bin_edges` method is called from an instance of a class, and passing the `self` parameter to the `_adjust_bin_edges` method.

The corrected code would be:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/resample.py

# Import the necessary functions
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT
import pandas.core.resample as resample

# this is the buggy function that has been fixed
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = resample._get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
