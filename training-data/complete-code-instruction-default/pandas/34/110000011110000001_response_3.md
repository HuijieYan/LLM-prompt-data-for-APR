The buggy function validates the `ax` input using the `isinstance` method, and an error is raised if `ax` is not an instance of DatetimeIndex. This assertion is likely incorrect as the failing test demonstrates an issue with daylight saving time (dst). The error message also indicates that an AmbiguousTimeError was raised, which is likely due to the implementation of daylight saving transitions.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the ambiguity caused by daylight saving time properly. One approach could be to account for the existence of ambiguous time, ensuring that it does not fall within the bin edges. This change will prevent the AmbiguousTimeError from being raised in such situations.

The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by inserting NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected function, the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function has been set to "NaT", which will insert NaT (Not a Time) for ambiguous times. This modification should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError encountered in the failing test case.
