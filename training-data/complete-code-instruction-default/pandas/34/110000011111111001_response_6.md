The error is likely to occur in the `_get_time_bins` function for the `TimeGrouper` class in the pandas library. It seems that the bug is causing an error when attempting to infer the DST time due to ambiguous time information.

The reason for this bug is that the `date_range` method is creating ambiguous labels for inference, which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The issue is likely related to how the bins and labels are being created and adjusted for `TimeGrouper`.

One approach to fixing this bug would be to ensure that the time bins and labels are created without ambiguity. This could involve adjusting the label creation process or handling ambiguous time information in a way that avoids the error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    if self.closed == "left":
        last = last - to_offset(self.freq)

    binner = arange(first, last + to_offset(self.freq), to_offset(self.freq), dtype="M8[ns]")
    binner = DatetimeIndex(binner, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)

    labels = binner.shift(1)

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    labels = labels.intersection(ax)

    return binner, [], labels
```

This corrected function creates non-ambiguous time bins and labels, ensuring that the DST time inference does not encounter any errors. This should allow the failing test to pass, and the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
