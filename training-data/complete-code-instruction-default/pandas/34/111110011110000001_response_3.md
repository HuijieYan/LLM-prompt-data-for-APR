Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error could be occurring due to the generation of time bins in the `_get_time_bins` function. The error message includes "Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times," which suggests that the time bins are not meeting the requirements for DST (Daylight Saving Time) transitions.

Bug's cause:
(a). The `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins, and it's failing to account for DST transitions, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.
(b). The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` creates a DateTimeIndex with a frequency of 1 hour, includes DST transitions and then attempts to downsample it by taking the mean for each day.
(c). The error message indicates a pytz AmbiguousTimeError, and it includes information about non-repeated times, suggesting a problem with DST transition handling during binning.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure proper handling of DST transitions while generating time bins.
2. Adjust the method for generating time bins to account for DST transitions, avoiding non-repeated times resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError.
3. Consider using a different method for generating time bins that is DST-aware and capable of handling DateTimeIndex with frequency including DST transitions.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Generate time bins with proper handling of DST transitions
    bins = pd.date_range(start=ax.min(), end=ax.max(), freq=self.freq, closed=self.closed)
    binner = bins
    labels = bins[:-1]  # Adjust labels based on the closed attribute

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the `_get_time_bins` function generates time bins using `pd.date_range` with proper handling of DST transitions by considering the start and end of the DateTimeIndex `ax`. The `binner` and `labels` are updated based on the generated `bins` to ensure correct time interval grouping. This correction should address the issue of non-repeated times leading to an AmbiguousTimeError and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
