1. The buggy function "_get_time_bins" is part of the "pandas.core.resample" module, and it is used in the context of resampling time series data. The related functions such as "_get_timestamp_range_edges", "ax", and "_adjust_bin_edges" are necessary for the correct functioning of "_get_time_bins".

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the section where it calculates the "first" and "last" values using "_get_timestamp_range_edges" and then constructs the "binner" and "labels" using "date_range".

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to the incorrect handling of time zone changes and ambiguous timestamps during resampling, which is highlighted in the GitHub issue. The current implementation does not handle ambiguous time correctly due to clock changes, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Use the correct timestamp range calculation method that handles ambiguous time due to clock changes.
   (b). Ensure that the labels and bins are correctly adjusted to account for ambiguous timestamps during resampling.
   (c). Handle time zone changes and ambiguous timestamps in a way that aligns with the expected behavior, as described in the GitHub issue.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT
import pandas.core.resample as r

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = r._get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = r._adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values)

    bins = r.lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code addresses the issue of ambiguous timestamps during resampling by ensuring that the handling of time zone changes and ambiguous timestamps aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
