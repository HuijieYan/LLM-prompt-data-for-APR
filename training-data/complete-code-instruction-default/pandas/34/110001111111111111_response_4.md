Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely to be located in the _get_time_bins function, as indicated by the AmbiguousTimeError being raised by the failing test. This suggests that there is an issue with handling the time bins, labels, and range edges when dealing with ambiguous timestamps due to daylight saving time changes.

Bug's Cause:
The failing test involves grouping time series data using pd.Grouper with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. The function _get_time_bins is responsible for creating the time bins and labels for the grouping operation. However, the handling of ambiguous timestamps due to daylight saving time changes is not properly implemented, resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the logic for handling ambiguous timestamps on days when daylight saving time changes occur.
2. Ensure that the timestamps for the time bins and labels are correctly adjusted to account for the ambiguous time.
3. Make use of the timezone information to handle the ambiguous timestamps accurately.
4. Consider the relationship between the frequency of the time series data and the occurrence of daylight saving time changes.

Corrected Code:
```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, DataFrame, date_range, NaT, Timestamp
from pandas.core.resample import lib

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code includes adjustments to properly handle ambiguous timestamps on days when daylight saving time changes occur. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
