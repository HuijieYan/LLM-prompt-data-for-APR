The bug is related to the time changeover day in Cuba, where the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError. The issue arises from the fact that midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day, and the code does not handle this properly. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is around the logic dealing with binning the time intervals and labels, particularly around midnight on the clock change day. 

The bug's cause is the failure to handle ambiguous timestamps around midnight on the clock change day. This causes the labels to be incorrect, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, the code must be able to handle the ambiguous time on the clock change day. This would involve correctly handling the time intervals and labels around midnight on the clock change day.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
  
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels.shift(1, freq=self.freq)
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1, freq=self.freq)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles the ambiguous time issue, shifts the labels if necessary, and correctly adjusts the labels to make sure there are no more labels than bins, addressing the problem described in the GitHub issue.
