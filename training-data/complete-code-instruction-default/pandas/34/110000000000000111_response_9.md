1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is related to the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba". The issue is related to the implementation of the pd.Grouper function where it fails to handle ambiguous timestamps on specific days.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the handling of timestamps and frequency bins, especially when dealing with timezones and ambiguous times.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a) The buggy function is responsible for creating time bins based on the specified frequency and timezone information. It seems that the function is not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to errors when creating the bins.
   (b) The GitHub issue provides an example where the code fails when dealing with a timezone change, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a) Adding specific handling for ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that the code can correctly determine the appropriate bins in such cases.
   (b) Modifying the bin creation process to account for potential issues with ambiguous times, such as using the tz_localize and tz_convert methods appropriately.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64_any_dtype as is_datetime

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not is_datetime(ax):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = ax
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    binner = labels = pd.date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should appropriately handle ambiguous timestamps and create the time bins without causing the AmbiguousTimeError described in the GitHub issue.
