1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue because the issue mentions that on a long clock change day in Cuba, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, and the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError. This means that there is an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps, which might be related to the generation of time bins in the function.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the generation of the time bins and labels, particularly in handling ambiguous timestamps.

3. The bug's cause is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This could be due to the incorrect generation of time bins and labels when there are ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock change days.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a) Implementing a mechanism to handle ambiguous timestamps during the generation of time bins and labels.
   (b) Ensuring that the labels and bins accurately represent the timestamps, even in the presence of ambiguous times.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Handling ambiguous timestamps
    if ax.tz is not None:
        tz = ax.tz
    else:
        tz = self.freq

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code includes a handling mechanism for ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that the labels and bins accurately represent the timestamps, even in the presence of ambiguous times. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
