1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class and is used for grouping time intervals in the Pandas library. The GitHub issue is related to using the groupby method with daily frequency failing with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function could be related to the handling of time interval labels and bins, especially when encountering ambiguous timestamps.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The `_get_time_bins` function is responsible for generating time bins and labels for grouping time intervals based on the frequency provided.
   (b). The `TimeGrouper` class contains this function and is used for custom groupby operations with time intervals.
   (c). The GitHub issue describes how on a long clock-change day in Cuba, ambiguous timestamps are not handled correctly, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError when using the groupby method with daily frequency.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Implement a check to handle ambiguous timestamps when generating time bins and labels.
   - Refactor the code to account for timezone changes and ambiguous times when creating time intervals.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... other class code ...

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

        # Updated block to handle ambiguous timestamps
        if ax.tz:
            dst_transition_times = ax.tz._utc_transition_times
            dst_offsets = np.array(ax.tz._transition_info[2])
            ambiguous_mask = np.in1d(first, dst_transition_times)
            dst_offset_diff = np.tile(dst_offsets, (len(first), 1))
            offsets = np.abs((first[:, None] - dst_transition_times).values)
            closest_offset_search = np.where(offsets == np.min(offsets, axis=1)[:, None])
            dst_offset_candidates = dst_offset_diff[ambiguous_mask]
            dst_offset = dst_offsets[closest_offset_search[1]]
            dst_offset[ambiguous_mask] = dst_offset_candidates
            first += dst_offset

        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # ... remaining code for generating bins and handling labels ...

        return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code includes an updated block to handle ambiguous timestamps when creating time intervals. This would resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug, where the groupby method fails on a clock change day in Cuba.
