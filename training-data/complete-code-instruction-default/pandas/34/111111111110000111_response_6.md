Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error location is in the `_get_time_bins` function, specifically in the creation of the binner and labels using the `date_range` function. This is leading to an AmbiguousTimeError as reported in the failing test.

Elucidation of the bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating bins and labels for time groups based on a given frequency.
(b). The class `TimeGrouper` contains the `_get_time_bins` function and is used for time-interval grouping.
(c). The related functions `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` are called within the `_get_time_bins` function for calculating timestamp range edges and adjusting bin edges, respectively.
(d). The failing test is `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` and the error message indicates an AmbiguousTimeError due to a clock change issue with the date conversion.
(e). The GitHub Issue describes a similar problem and the expected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Avoid using `date_range` function to create binner and labels and handle ambiguous time situations.
2. Handle ambiguous time situations caused by daylight savings time or clock changes by ensuring proper conversion and labeling.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous time situations by using a different method to create binner and labels
    binner = ax.floor(self.freq, ambiguous="NaT", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    labels = ax.resample(self.freq, closed=self.closed, label=self.label, base=self.base).max()

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected function ensures proper handling of ambiguous time situations by using alternative methods to create binner and labels, which should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and also address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
