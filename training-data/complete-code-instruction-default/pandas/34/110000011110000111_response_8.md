The buggy function is _get_time_bins, which is called when the failing test function test_downsample_dst_at_midnight is executed. The error message from the failing test indicates an AmbiguousTimeError due to an issue with handling the transition from standard time to daylight saving time in the timezone "America/Havana".

The issue is caused by the failure to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly when creating the bins for resampling. The specific problem lies in the creation of the binner and labels using the date_range function, which does not account for daylight saving time transitions.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the ambiguous timestamps properly when creating the binner and labels. This can be achieved by utilizing a different approach to create the bins and labels that takes into account the ambiguity of the timestamps during the transition from standard time to daylight saving time.

The corrected code for the problematic function should address the handling of ambiguous timestamps and ensure that the bins and labels are created correctly to account for the time transition issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The changes made to the function involve using the ambiguous="infer" argument in the date_range function to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps. This modification ensures that the bins and labels are created taking into account the daylight saving time transition and resolves the AmbiguousTimeError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
