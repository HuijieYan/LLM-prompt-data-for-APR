The bug in the provided function is likely related to the handling of time zones and daylight saving time. The `pd.Grouper` class has a defective behavior when creating time bins, especially around ambiguous time during daylight saving changes.

The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem of timestamp ambiguity on clock change days in specific time zones, which causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_time_bins` needs to handle the ambiguous timestamps during the daylight saving time change, ensuring that the time bins are created correctly.

One approach to solve this problem would be to explicitly handle the ambiguous timestamp issue during the creation of time bins, ensuring that the timestamps are interpreted correctly. This may involve using methods provided by third-party libraries or updating pandas to a version that contains a fix for this issue.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function that addresses the issue raised on GitHub:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first,
            end=last,
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if len(binner) > len(bins):
            binner = binner[:len(bins)]
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected function takes into account the possibility of ambiguous timestamps due to daylight saving changes and ensures that the time bins are created correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
