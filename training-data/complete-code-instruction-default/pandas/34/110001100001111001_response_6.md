The buggy function is expected to create time bins and return binner, bins, and labels. However, the bug is caused by a mismanagement of date offsets and timezones while generating the labels and bin_edges. This causes the labels to be inconsistent with the bins and the original time axis.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the line `binner = labels = date_range(...` where the `date_range` function is called to generate labels. This function does not consider the timezone, and as a result, the labels and bins do not match properly.

To fix the bug, the correct timezone should be applied consistently throughout the process, and the generation of bins and labels needs to be aligned with the frequency and timezone settings.

To address the bug, the corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from pandas import Timestamp, DatetimeIndex
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

# Fixed function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.to_series().values
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values.astype('int64'))

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected function, the timezone information is consistently applied, and the creation of bins and labels is aligned with the frequency and timezone settings. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output based on the provided input.
