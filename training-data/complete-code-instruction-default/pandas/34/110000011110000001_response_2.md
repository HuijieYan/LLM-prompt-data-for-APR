The `_get_time_bins` function is responsible for generating time bins and associated labels for a given `DatetimeIndex`. The failing test function, `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, tries to resample time data using this function, but it throws an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This error is likely to be caused by incorrect handling of time zone localization in the `_get_time_bins` function.

The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is at the line:
```python
binner = labels = date_range(
    freq=self.freq,
    start=first,
    end=last,
    tz=ax.tz,
    name=ax.name,
    ambiguous="infer",
    nonexistent="shift_forward",
)
```
Here, the `ambiguous` parameter is set to "infer", which may lead to an ambiguous time error.

In the failing test, the time zone is being changed from UTC to America/Havana. The error message indicates that an ambiguous time error is raised because the time 2018-11-04 00:00:00 is ambiguous.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle time zone localization properly and avoid ambiguous time situations.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_localized = ax.tz_localize(ax.tz)  # Localize ax to its own timezone
    first, last = ax_localized.min(), ax_localized.max()

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax_localized, ax)

    ax_values = ax_localized.asi8
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected function, the `ax` is localized to its own timezone, and the time bins and labels are adjusted accordingly. This approach should avoid ambiguous times and the function should now pass the failing test.
