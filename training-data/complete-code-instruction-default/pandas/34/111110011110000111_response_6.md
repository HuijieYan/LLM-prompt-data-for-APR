The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_get_time_bins` method, specifically in the handling of time bins and labels, as well as the adjustment of labels when the length of the bins does not match the length of the labels.

The cause of the bug is related to the handling of ambiguous time in the time zone conversion, which leads to an "AmbiguousTimeError." This is reported in the failing test, and the error is consistent with the user-reported issue on GitHub, where the expectation is for the call to `groupby` to return three groups, but an "AmbiguousTimeError" is being raised on ambiguous timestamps such as midnight during the clock change in Cuba.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of ambiguous times and ensure that the labels and bins match in length.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_localized = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_convert(ax.tz)
    first = ax_localized[0]
    last = ax_localized[-1]
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed, label=self.label
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code adjusts the time zone conversion and localization to handle ambiguous times. It also ensures that the length of the bins and labels match, and the labels are adjusted accordingly.

With this fixed code, the `groupby` call in the failing test should return the expected result, and the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved.
