1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it is directly related to the behavior of the `pd.Grouper` when handling daily frequency with a time zone conversion. The issue mentions the problematic behavior of `pd.Grouper` on long clock-change days in Cuba, specifically on November 4th.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section that handles the date range construction with the `date_range` function, as this is where the behavior might be impacted by time zone and ambiguous timestamps.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function is responsible for generating time bins based on the given axis, which might be impacted by the time zone and ambiguous timestamp behavior as highlighted in the GitHub issue.
   (b). The GitHub issue specifically mentions that the call to `pd.Grouper` raises an AmbiguousTimeError on long clock-change days in Cuba, which indicates that the function responsible for creating time bins might not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly during the construction of the time bins to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.
   (b). Ensure that the time zone conversion and handling of time zone-related issues in the date range construction is done accurately.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function, considering the insights from the GitHub issue and potential approaches for fixing the bug, is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax = ax.tz_convert(None)  # Convert to UTC to avoid ambiguous time errors
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=None,  # Disregard time zone to avoid ambiguity
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Replace ambiguous values with NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we handle the ambiguous timestamps by converting the axis to UTC, disregarding the time zone when creating the date range, and replacing ambiguous values with NaT. These measures should help avoid the AmbiguousTimeError described in the GitHub issue.
