1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the mentioned GitHub issue which is related to using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. The error is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on this specific day and is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
2. The potential error location within the function is the handling of ambiguous timestamps on the clock change day in Cuba, especially concerning the label and bin edges generation.
3. (a) The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins and labels based on the input axis `ax`, which in the context of the GitHub issue is a DatetimeIndex.
   (b) The GitHub issue describes a specific problem related to the behavior of `pd.Grouper` when working with time series data that includes an ambiguous timestamp due to a clock change day (daylight saving time).
   The problem is related to how the labels and bins are generated, especially when dealing with the ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba. This is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` as the function is failing to handle the situation appropriately.
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly handling the generation of labels and bins for the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day, possibly by utilizing the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters in the `date_range` function.
   - Handling the situation appropriately to avoid raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function based on the suggested approaches:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range
import numpy as np
import pandas._libs.lib as lib
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Correctly handle generation of labels and bins
    freq = to_offset(self.freq)
    ambiguous = "infer"  # Set ambiguous parameter to infer
    nonexistent = "shift_forward"  # Set nonexistent parameter to shift_forward
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        freq=freq,
        ambiguous=ambiguous,
        nonexistent=nonexistent,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, np.datetime64('NaT'))
        labels = labels.insert(0, np.datetime64('NaT'))

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
