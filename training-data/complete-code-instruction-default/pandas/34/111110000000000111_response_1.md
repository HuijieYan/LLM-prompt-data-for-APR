1. The buggy function is part of the class `TimeGrouper`, which is a customized groupby class for time-interval grouping. The GitHub issue states that the call to groupby can raise an AmbiguousTimeError on a long clock-change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_get_time_bins` method, where it handles the time binning and labels. The issue reported on GitHub relates to the handling of ambiguous timestamps on long clock-change days, which is likely related to this part of the function.

3. (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating time bins and labels based on the input DatetimeIndex.
   (b). The buggy class `TimeGrouper` is a custom groupby class that uses the `_get_time_bins` method to create time bins and labels for grouping time-intervals.
   (c). The GitHub issue information indicates that on long clock-change days, such as one in Cuba, the call to groupby can lead to an AmbiguousTimeError, suggesting that the handling of ambiguous timestamps is not accurate.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Address the handling of ambiguous timestamps on long clock-change days, ensuring that the time binning and labels are correctly identified without causing AmbiguousTimeError.
   (b). Modify the logic in the `_get_time_bins` method to detect and handle ambiguous timestamps properly, taking into account the specific case of long clock-change days.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code addresses the handling of time bins and labels in the `_get_time_bins` method, ensuring that the creation of time intervals and labels is accurately handled, avoiding the AmbiguousTimeError reported in the GitHub issue.
