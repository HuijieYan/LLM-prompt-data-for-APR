The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function can be identified as it doesn't handle the case where the frequency is a Day.

The possible approaches for fixing the bug are:
1. Handle the case where the frequency is a Day.
2. Ensure that the bin_edges and bins are generated correctly, especially when the frequency is a Day.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if self.freq.n:
        ax = ax.normalize()

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = ax.copy()
        binner.freq = self.freq
        binner.name = ax.name
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    
    # assuming self.closed is 'left' based on the original code
    bin_edges, bins = get_bins(ax_values, binner.asi8, 'left')

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By using the code above, the TimeGrouper class should now handle the case where the frequency is a Day properly.
