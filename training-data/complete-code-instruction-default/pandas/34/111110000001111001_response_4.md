The bug is caused by incorrect adjustments to the bin edges and labels, resulting in an inaccurate calculation of bins. Specifically, the function is using incorrect bin_edges, which is leading to incorrect bins. 

To fix the bug, we need to correctly adjust the bin edges and labels to ensure that the bins are calculated accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated code includes the correct adjustments to the bin edges and labels, ensuring that the bins are accurately calculated.

By correcting the adjustments to the bin edges and labels, the function ensures that the bins are calculated accurately, addressing the root cause of the bug.
