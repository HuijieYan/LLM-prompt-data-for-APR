The problem occurs when the date range spans a day with an ambiguous time due to a daylight saving change, such as in the provided test case where the date range crosses the daylight saving time in Cuba.

It is likely that the issue is occurring when the binner and bin_edges are being adjusted within the _get_time_bins function, potentially resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError when the resulting labels are used for grouping.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way binner and bin_edges are being calculated and used. One possible solution would be to use the TimeGrouper's _adjust_bin_edges function to generate the bin_edges instead of invoking the function directly in the _get_time_bins function.

Here's the patched and corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = pd.date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, _ = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, binner.values, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we've updated the calculation and usage of binner and bin_edges to avoid potential issues with ambiguous times and daylight saving time changes. We used the TimeGrouper's _adjust_bin_edges function to adjust bin_edges instead of invoking the function directly within _get_time_bins to ensure consistency and avoid potential errors. This corrected version should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and ensure the function passes the failing test.
