The bug in the code arises when using the `pd.Grouper` function to group data with a daily frequency on a clock-change day in a specific time zone. The error message indicates an AmbiguousTimeError, meaning that midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, and the `pd.Grouper` function does not handle this properly.

The problematic function is `_get_time_bins` in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. It does not handle ambiguous timestamps properly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError. The test code `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` highlights the issue and the expected behavior.

Potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the timezone and labeling of the groups.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle ambiguous timestamps properly, especially when dealing with daily frequency. This involves ensuring that the grouping labels are correctly assigned, and the ambiguous timestamps are addressed appropriately.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Use tz_localize to handle ambiguous timestamps
    start = ax.min().tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")
    end = ax.max().tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=start,
        end=end,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This corrected code ensures that ambiguous timestamps are handled using `tz_localize` with the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter, which resolves the AmbiguousTimeError. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test.
