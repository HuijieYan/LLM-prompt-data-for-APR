1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` takes a DatetimeIndex `ax` and performs various operations on it to get the time bins. The related functions mentioned in the buggy function include `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` which are also used within `_get_time_bins`. The failing test code `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to group the data by day and average it, but it raises an AmbiguousTimeError.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is likely in the calculation of the time bins and labels, as it seems to be causing the AmbiguousTimeError.

3. The buggy function may be causing the AmbiguousTimeError because it does not handle ambiguous time zones correctly, which leads to issues when trying to generate time bins and labels for the resampling process. This is evident from the failing test code and the error message, which mentions the AmbiguousTimeError and the inability to infer the DST time.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the time bins and labels are generated in a way that handles ambiguous time zones properly, especially when switching between different time zones.
   - Check if the timezone conversion and resampling logic is robust enough to handle ambiguous time zones without raising errors.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex) or ax.tz is None:
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex with a defined timezone"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Use the timezone from the input index
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the timezone from the input index is used when creating the time bins and labels. And we also provide appropriate checks to handle ambiguous time zones. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and the function should pass the failing test.
