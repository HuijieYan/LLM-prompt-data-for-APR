The bug is caused by incorrect binning of the timestamps due to the period that includes a transition from standard time to daylight savings time. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data.

The issue is likely in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class, where the binning and labeling are being done based on the timestamps. This creates ambiguous labels and results in the error.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the bin edges and labels to handle the transition from standard time to daylight savings time. This will ensure that the bins and labels correspond correctly to the timestamps, and the `AmbiguousTimeError` is avoided.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Adjust first and last to handle daylight savings time transition
    first = first.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous='infer')
    last = last.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous='infer')

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This modification ensures that the bin edges and labels are adjusted to handle the transition from standard time to daylight savings time, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` that was occurring before.
