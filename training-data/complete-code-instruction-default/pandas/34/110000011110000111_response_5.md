Potential error location: The potential error location within the problematic function is with the `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')` call in the failing test. It seems that the error is related to handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days.

Bug's cause:
The bug occurs when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on a clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised, as the code fails to handle this situation correctly.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days and ensure that it correctly labels the groups on such days.
2. Use the `ambiguous` parameter in the `tz_localize` method to handle ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The updated code should now handle ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days, as well as addressing the specific issue reported in the failing test. This should resolve the problem and allow the test to pass, while also addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
