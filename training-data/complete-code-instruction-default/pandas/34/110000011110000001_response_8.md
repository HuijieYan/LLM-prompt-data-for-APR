The buggy function is _get_time_bins, which is part of a larger resampling process implemented in the pandas library. The failing test is trying to resample a dataframe with a frequency of 1 Day (freq="1D"). The specific issue arises when the data used for resampling contains timestamps in the ambiguous time zone, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

The potential error location is in the part where the labels are created using date_range and tz_localize. This is evident from the error message, which indicates that the code is failing to infer daylight saving time (dst) due to ambiguous timestamps.

The bug is caused by the labels generated using date_range and tz_localize, which do not handle ambiguous time zones effectively. As a result, the resampling process fails to infer dst time from the provided timestamps, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the way labels are created to handle ambiguous time zones effectively. This can be achieved by utilizing the concept of inferred_dst, where the ambiguous times are labeled appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use the reindex method with inferred_dst to handle ambiguous time zones effectively
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name,
    ).reindex(ax, method='inferred_dst')

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By using the reindex method with inferred_dst, the corrected code effectively handles ambiguous time zones, ensuring that dst times are appropriately inferred during the resampling process. This fix should allow the resampling process to pass the failing test without raising an AmbiguousTimeError.
