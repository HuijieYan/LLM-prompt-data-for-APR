Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `_get_time_bins` function, specifically in the way that `binner` and `labels` are being created.

Bug Cause:
The error is due to the way the `binner` and `labels` are being created. The `binner` and `labels` are being created using a call to `date_range` in the `_get_time_bins` function. This call to `date_range` is not handling the daylight saving time (DST) transition correctly, which is causing the timestamps to be ambiguous, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `binner` and `labels` are created with correct handling of DST transition. This can be done by adding the `infer_dst_tz` parameter in the call to `date_range` and setting it to `True`. In addition, we need to ensure that the `ambiguous` parameter is set to `'infer'`. This will allow `date_range` to handle the ambiguous times correctly. 

Additionally, we should also handle the case when there are more `labels` than `bins` by adjusting the `labels` to match the number of `bins`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        infer_dst_tz=True,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should handle the ambiguous times correctly and resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue.
