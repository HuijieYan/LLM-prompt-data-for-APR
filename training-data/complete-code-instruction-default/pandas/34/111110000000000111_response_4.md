Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `_get_time_bins` function, where it tries to handle daily frequency grouping for a date range that includes an ambiguous timestamp due to a clock change.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` does not handle the situation where a clock change results in an ambiguous timestamp, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
(b). The buggy class `TimeGrouper` is responsible for time-interval grouping using the `pd.Grouper` class. It uses the `_get_time_bins` function internally, leading to the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
(c). The GitHub issue describes a scenario where on a long clock-change day in Cuba, there is a call to `groupby` using `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency, which raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps resulting from a clock change.
2. Ensure that the `pd.Grouper` class, along with the `TimeGrouper` class, can handle daily frequency grouping without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError` in scenarios like the one described in the GitHub issue.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    binner = labels = ax.floor("D")
    return binner, [], labels
```

This corrected function uses the `floor` method to round the timestamps down to the nearest day, ensuring that ambiguous timestamps due to a clock change are handled by grouping them within the same day, avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError` that was being raised.
