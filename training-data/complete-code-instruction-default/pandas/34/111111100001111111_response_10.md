Potential error location within the problematic function:

The bug appears to be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to the calculation of the first and last timestamp and how these are used to create bins and labels for the time grouper.

Bug cause:

The bug causes the groupby operation to fail and raise an AmbiguousTimeError when encountering an ambiguous timestamp during a clock change day in Cuba. This is due to improper handling of the timestamps and bin edges, resulting in incorrect bins and labels.

Suggested fixes:

1. Properly handle ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba by utilizing the tz parameter when constructing the bins and labels.

2. Ensure that the first and last timestamps are calculated correctly, taking into account the time zone and ambiguous time periods.

3. Adjust the binning process to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps and create bins and labels that align with the expected behavior.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Modified buggy function

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, tz=ax.tz, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner, labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
            closed=self.closed,
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner[1:]
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code addresses the bug by properly handling ambiguous timestamps and ensures that the bins and labels are constructed correctly, taking into account the time zone and ambiguous time periods. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
