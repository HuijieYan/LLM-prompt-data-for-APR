1. The buggy function is a part of the Pandas library and is related to the issue of pd.Grouper failing with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba. The function is responsible for creating time bins based on the input datetime index, and the issue arises from the handling of ambiguous timestamps, particularly on the clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of ambiguous time stamps, which leads to the AmbiguousTimeError when the function is called with data containing ambiguous timestamps.

3. (a) The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating time bins and labels based on the input datetime index. It is a part of the groupby functionality in Pandas.
   (b) The GitHub issue provides a code sample where a datetime index is being used and grouped using `pd.Grouper`. On a long clock-change day in Cuba, when midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError. The expected output is for the call to groupby to return three groups (one for each day, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), and for the group for the 4th of November to be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and contain the 25 hourly data points for that day. The issue is in handling the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day, which is not being handled correctly by the function.

4. To fix the bug, potential approaches include:
   - Handling ambiguous timestamps explicitly by checking for ambiguous timestamps and addressing them appropriately. This could involve providing an option to handle ambiguous timestamps based on user preference or using the 'infer' option for ambiguous times in the code.
   - Ensuring that the time bins and labels are adjusted to account for any ambiguous or non-existing timestamps, such as on the clock change day.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue and includes handling for ambiguous timestamps on the clock change day in Cuba:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handling ambiguous timestamps explicitly
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the ambiguous parameter is set to 'infer' to handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly. This allows the function to handle the issue of AmbiguousTimeError on the clock change day in Cuba.
