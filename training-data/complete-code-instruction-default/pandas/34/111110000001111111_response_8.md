The problem seems to be related to the time zone conversion and the handling of ambiguous timestamps due to the clock change in Cuba. The input parameter `ax` passed to the function is a `DatetimeIndex` with timezone information, but it seems that the function is not correctly handling the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change.

Based on the input and the expected output, the issue lies in the calculation of `first` and `last` within the `_get_time_bins` function. The code fails to handle the ambiguous timestamp that occurs due to the clock change on November 4th.

To fix the bug, the function should use the `ambiguous` argument in the `date_range` function to handle ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions. Additionally, the calculation of `first` and `last` should take the ambiguous timestamp into consideration.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Handle ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax[0].floor('D'),
        end=ax[-1].ceil('D'),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='infer'
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change in Cuba, and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
