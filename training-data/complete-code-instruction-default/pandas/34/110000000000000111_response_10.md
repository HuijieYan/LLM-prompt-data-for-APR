1. The buggy function is related to the issue on GitHub because it is used to group time series data into time bins, which is the same functionality that is causing the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba. The problem seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the part of the code that handles the creation and labeling of time bins, especially when dealing with ambiguous timestamps due to daylight saving time or other reasons.

3. (a) The buggy function is responsible for creating time bins for grouping time series data. It checks the input axis `ax` to ensure it is a DatetimeIndex and then proceeds to create time bins and labels based on the given frequency and timestamp range.
   (b) The GitHub issue information indicates that the problem occurs on clock change days in Cuba, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError when using pd.Grouper to group the data. This suggests that the bug in the function may be related to how it handles ambiguous timestamps due to daylight saving time.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may involve improving the handling of ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that the function correctly identifies and resolves ambiguity in timestamps, and properly labels the time bins.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
  
    if self.freq == '1D':
        # handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days
        first = first.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous='infer', nonexistent='shift_forward')
        last = last.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous='infer', nonexistent='shift_forward')
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In this corrected version, the function specifically handles ambiguous timestamps on clock change days by using the `tz_localize` method with arguments `ambiguous='infer'` and `nonexistent='shift_forward'` when the frequency is '1D'. This ensures that ambiguous timestamps are properly resolved, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
