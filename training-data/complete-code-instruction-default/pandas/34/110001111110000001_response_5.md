The function `_get_time_bins` in the `resample.py` file is responsible for generating time bins based on the provided axis. The error message points to an issue with ambiguous time, and it appears that the function is not handling daylight saving time transitions correctly.

The issue appears to be with the `date_range` function used to create the bins and labels. It is likely that this function does not handle ambiguous time correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` raised during the test.

To fix this issue, we need to use the appropriate arguments in the `date_range` function to handle ambiguous time. Additionally, we may need to handle the daylight saving time transitions more effectively.

One possible fix for this issue is to ensure that the `ambiguous` argument in the `date_range` function is set to `True` to infer ambiguous times during the creation of bins and labels. Additionally, we may need to handle daylight saving time transitions explicitly to avoid errors related to ambiguous time.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # Existing code
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous=True,  # Set ambiguous to True to infer ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the updated code, the `ambiguous=True` argument is added to the `date_range` function to handle ambiguous times. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` that was raised during the failing test.
