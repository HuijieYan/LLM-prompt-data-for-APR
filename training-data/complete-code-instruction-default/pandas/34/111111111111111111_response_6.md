Potential error location:

Looking at the failing test for the buggy function, it seems that the problem arises from the `date_range` creation within `_get_time_bins`. In particular, the `date_range` appears to be creating an ambiguous timestamp for the start/end time when transitioning into and out of Daylight Saving Time. This ambiguity is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised.

Bug's cause:

The bug appears to be caused by the creation of the `date_range` within the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class. The resulting `date_range` is creating ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change, leading to the failure in the test case provided.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

One approach to fix the bug is to adjust the date range generation within the `_get_time_bins` method to handle ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change. This might involve incorporating logic to account for ambiguous times when creating the date range.

Another approach could be to utilize a different method for generating the date range that handles ambiguous times more gracefully.

Additionally, it may be necessary to update the logic handling the start and end times within the `_get_time_bins` method to ensure that they do not result in ambiguous timestamps.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = pd.date_range(
        start=first.tz_localize(None),
        end=last.tz_localize(None),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner.copy()
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code attempts to handle ambiguous timestamps by explicitly localizing the `first` and `last` timestamps to remove the ambiguity when creating the date range. Additionally, it refactors the logic for handling the labels and bins, ensuring that they align properly even when ambiguous times are present.
