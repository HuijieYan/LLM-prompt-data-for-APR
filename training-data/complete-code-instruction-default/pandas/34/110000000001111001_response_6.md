The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is intended to generate time bins and labels based on the input `ax` and the provided frequency. The bug seems to be with the labeling logic and the adjustment of labels. This is evident from the incorrect output of `labels`, `binner`, and `bins`.

The cause of the bug is likely the incorrect manipulation of labels and bins based on the specified frequency. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with the use of `tz` information or incorrect handling of time zones, leading to discrepancies in the generated labels and bins.

To fix the bug, the labels and bins should be adjusted based on the frequency and the time zone information. Additionally, the logic for adjusting labels and handling the time zone needs to be enhanced.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, Timestamp, date_range, NaT
import numpy as np

# corrected function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().normalize()
    last = ax.max().normalize()

    if first != ax[0]:
        first = first + self.freq
    if last != ax[-1]:
        last = last - self.freq

    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)

    bins = np.searchsorted(binner.asi8, ax.asi8)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

This corrected function now takes into account the frequency, time zone, and labeling logic to generate the correct time bins and labels based on the input `ax`. It should now provide the expected output for the given inputs and types.
