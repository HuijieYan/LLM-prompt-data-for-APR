The bug is likely located in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The error message indicates an issue with an ambiguous time during a clock change in Cuba, and the failing test also involves a datetime index being grouped using `pd.Grouper`. 

The GitHub issue also provides more details about the expected output and the version of pandas being used. It states that the call to `groupby` should return three groups for 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November, handling the ambiguous time correctly.

The bug is likely caused by the `_get_time_bins` function not handling ambiguous times properly, especially in the context of daylight saving time transitions.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    ax = ax.tz_convert(None)  # Remove timezone to prevent handling ambiguous times
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=ax.min(), end=ax.max(), freq=self.freq, tz=None, name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated function first removes the timezone from the input index to prevent handling ambiguous times, then creates the binner and labels using `date_range` with the timezone set to `None`. This approach should avoid the AmbiguousTimeError when grouping datetime indexes with ambiguous times.

It's important to note that this corrected code should handle the ambiguous time correctly while also passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
