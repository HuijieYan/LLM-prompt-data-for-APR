The issue is caused by the usage of `date_range` with closed frequency for binning timestamps that are ambiguous because of a clock change.

The function is failing to account for ambiguous times when generating bins using a combination of `date_range` and `lib.generate_bins_dt64`. As a result, an AmbiguousTimeError is being raised when calling `groupby` on a long clock-change day in Cuba, which indicates that the datetime index frequencies are not being handled correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how bins are generated and labeled when dealing with ambiguous times due to clock changes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import get_offset
import pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets as liboffset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use converted first and last values to account for ambiguous times
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    first = first.tz_localize(ax.tz)
    last = last.tz_localize(ax.tz)

    if isinstance(self.freq, (str, liboffset.Tick)):
        freq = to_offset(self.freq)
    elif isinstance(self.freq, Timedelta):
        freq = get_offset(self.freq)
    else:
        freq = self.freq

    binner = date_range(
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max() + freq,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8

    # Generate bins and labels based on adjusted first and last
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, [first.value, last.value], self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    bin_edges = np.array([first.value, last.value])

    # adjust the labels based on frequency, known nothing about relative frequencies
    binner = binner[1:] - freq
    labels = binner[1:]

    if self.closed == "left":
        labels = labels.insert(0, first)
    else:
        labels = labels.insert(labels.shape[0], last)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub issue and handle ambiguous times due to clock changes in Cuba. We have modified the logic for generating bins and labels and adjusted the handling of ambiguous times using tz_localize. This should prevent the AmbiguousTimeError from occurring and produce the expected groups when calling `groupby` on a long clock-change day in Cuba.
