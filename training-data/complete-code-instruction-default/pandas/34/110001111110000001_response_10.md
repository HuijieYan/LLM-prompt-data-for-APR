The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to obtain time bins from a given `ax` parameter. The function seems to have some logical issues, especially related to how `binner` and `labels` are being assigned and used. It also seems that the time zone handling is problematic, which is evident from the error message.

The error message indicates that there is a problem related to ambiguous time in daylight savings time transitions when the time is set to midnight. This suggests that the time bins are not handled properly, potentially due to the incorrect usage of `binner` and `labels`.

To fix the bug, the time bins should be generated in a way that considers daylight savings time transitions and handles time zones properly.

The incorrect handling of the `binner` and `labels` variables also seems to be a cause for the failure. These variables should be assigned and used appropriately to avoid potential issues.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# corrected buggy function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last + self.freq,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        closed=self.closed
    )
    labels = binner

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these corrections, the function should now handle time bins appropriately, including proper handling of time zones and daylight savings time transitions. This should make the function pass the failing test.
