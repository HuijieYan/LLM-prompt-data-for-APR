The bug is caused by the `_get_time_bins` function, which is part of the `TimeGrouper` class. The failing test is a result of an AmbiguousTimeError being raised when trying to perform a groupby operation on a DataFrame with a datetime index that has ambiguous timestamps due to a clock change day in Cuba.

The error is caused by the `date_range` function within the `_get_time_bins` function, which is unable to handle ambiguous timestamps resulting from a clock change day, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps that arise from a clock change day. This can be achieved by using a different approach to generate the date range and properly handling the ambiguous timestamps.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_values = ax.asi8

    if self.closed == "right":
        bin_edges = np.concatenate([ax_values, [ax_values[-1] + self.freq.value]], axis=None)
    else:
        bin_edges = np.concatenate([[ax_values[0] - self.freq.value], ax_values], axis=None)

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(bin_edges, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = DatetimeIndex(bin_edges, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function handles the generation of bin edges and labels differently to properly handle ambiguous timestamps resulting from a clock change day. This fix should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
