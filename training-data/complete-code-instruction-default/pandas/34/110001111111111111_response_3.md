The bug in the provided function is causing an AmbiguousTimeError due to DST transition in Cuba. The issue occurs when trying to downsample data on the day when the local time changes due to DST. The problem arises from the incorrect calculation of the time bins and labels.

The issue is likely related to the incorrect use of the 'date_range()' function while creating bins, which leads to an AmbiguousTimeError. 

To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the labels and bins are correctly created to handle the DST transition. Additionally, the bins and labels generation should consider the timezone and potential ambiguous times.

Given the analysis, the buggy function can be fixed by modifying the code as follows:

```python
from pandas import Timedelta, NaT
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

class TimeGrouper:
    ...
    
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
        first -= Timedelta(1, "ms")
        last += Timedelta(1, "ms")

        start, end, closed = first, last, self.closed
        if self.closed == "right":
            start, end = last, first
            closed = "left"

        binner = date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=closed, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner[1:]
        else:
            labels = binner

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

With the above fixed code, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved. This approach modifies the way time bins and labels are created, ensuring they handle the DST transition correctly.
