The buggy function is a method called `_get_time_bins` inside the class `TimeGrouper` in the file `pandas/core/resample.py`. This method is used to return a binner, bins, and labels based on the values passed in the `ax` parameter. It involves determining the first and last values in the `ax` parameter, and then creating bins and labels based on the frequency.

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` tries to downsample data by resampling it to an average of 1 day using `dataframe.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq="1D")).mean()`. The test is failing with an `AmbiguousTimeError`, indicating a problem with daylight saving time.

The potential error location in the function `_get_time_bins` is likely related to the date range generation, which is causing an issue with daylight saving time.

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of date ranges, especially when dealing with dates near the boundary of daylight saving time transitions. It appears that the date range is not being generated properly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the date range generation needs to be adjusted to handle daylight saving time transitions more effectively. It may involve using the appropriate timezone handling functions and considering the nature of the date boundaries.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor('D')
    last = ax[-1].ceil('D')

    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
    bin_edges = np.concatenate([binner, [binner[-1] + np.timedelta64(self.freq, 'ms')]])

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles the date range generation more effectively by using the `floor` and `ceil` methods to calculate the first and last values based on the day boundaries. It also adjusts the `bin_edges` based on the frequency and timezone, ensuring accurate generation of bins and labels, thereby addressing the daylight saving time issue.
