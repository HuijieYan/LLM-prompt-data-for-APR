The bug is sourced in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class. The function generates and manipulates time bins and labels for grouping. The error that causes the failing test occurs when no repeated times are present, leading to an ambiguous time error. 

The cause of the bug is likely the incorrect generation and manipulation of the `binner` and `labels` variables, in relation to the timezone conversion and date ranges.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` method should be modified to adequately handle ambiguous time issues and ensure the correct generation of bins and labels for time grouping. Considerations should include the generation of bins and labels that are timezone-aware and handle ambiguous times accurately.

The corrected code for the `TimeGrouper` class's `_get_time_bins` method is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Adjust to use the same timezone as input 'ax'
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Correct the labels based on binner
    labels = binner[1:]  # It's based on the logic from the original code

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The proposed fix addresses timezone issues and ensures correct generation and manipulation of bins and labels for time grouping. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the input/output variable information provided.
