There are several issues with the buggy function:

1. The call to the `date_range` function is not correct as it is missing the reference to the `pandas` library.
2. The `_adjust_bin_edges` function is being called as a method of the class, but it is defined as a function and should not be invoked as a method.
3. The `bin_edges` and `bins` variables are being calculated incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made:
1. Add an import statement for the `pandas` library at the beginning of the file.
2. Change the call to the `date_range` function to use the `pandas` reference.
3. Call the `_adjust_bin_edges` function as a regular function instead of a method of the class.
4. Correct the calculations for `bin_edges` and `bins`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = pd.date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = _adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = pd.Series(binner).searchsorted(ax_values, side=self.closed)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
