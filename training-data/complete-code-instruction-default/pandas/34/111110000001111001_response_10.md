This bug is likely caused by the incorrect use of the `DatetimeIndex` and `Timestamp` objects. These errors seem to stem from the `date_range` function and how it interacts with the provided `freq` parameter. Another issue seems to be with the way `bin_edges` are calculated. The `bin_edges` should be calculated to conform to the provided frequency, which is the `<Day>` type in this case.

The possible approach to fixing the bug would be to update the usage of `date_range` with the correct frequency and timezone parameters, as well as to accurately calculate the `bin_edges` based on the frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = ax
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first = ax.min().normalize()
        last = ax.max().normalize() + self.freq
    
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        bin_edges = binner.asi8
        bin_edges = np.insert(bin_edges, 0, bin_edges[0] - self.freq.nanos)
        bin_edges = bin_edges + self.base
    
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=False
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
    ```
