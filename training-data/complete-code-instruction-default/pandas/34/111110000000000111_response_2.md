1. The buggy function called `_get_time_bins` seems to be producing incorrect time bins which lead to the issue described in the GitHub issue. The function is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class which is used for time-interval grouping, and the issue is related to grouping with a daily frequency.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be the calculation of `binner` and `labels` which are used to create the bins for grouping. This calculation might not be handling ambiguous timestamps correctly.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps within the `_get_time_bins` function. The issue reported on GitHub also mentions the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change day in Cuba, which aligns with the potential error location identified within the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug would be to improve the handling of ambiguous timestamps within the `_get_time_bins` function. This could involve using the appropriate methods to handle such ambiguous times, ensuring the correct labels are assigned to each group.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)  # Fixed typo: _adjust_bin_edges should use binner as its first argument

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, binner, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issue with handling ambiguous timestamps and ensures the correct bins and labels are assigned to each group.
