The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised when grouping by day with daily frequency on a long clock-change day in Cuba. This is because the function doesn't handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly.

The issue is related to the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, specifically around the transition to daylight saving time on November 4th in the `America/Havana` timezone. This leads to the incorrect handling of the ambiguous timestamp, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `binner` and `labels` calculation to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days. This will involve using the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` methods to get the timestamps in the desired timezone. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `binner` and `labels` have the same length as the `bins` array.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_convert(self._tz)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=ax.min(), end=ax.max(), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this fix, the function should correctly handle the ambiguous timestamp on the clock-change day in Cuba and pass the failing test. This will also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
