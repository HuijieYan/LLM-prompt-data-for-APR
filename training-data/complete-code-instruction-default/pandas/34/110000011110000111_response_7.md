The potential error location in the buggy function is within the date_range() method call, specifically in the tz_localize() and ambiguous parameters.

The failing test and error message indicate that the AmbiguousTimeError is raised when trying to group the data by day due to an ambiguous timestamp, specifically on a long clock-change day in Cuba.

The GitHub issue further explains that the call to groupby should return three groups - one for each day, but it raises an AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba. The expected output is to have three groups and the group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00', containing the hourly data points for that day.

To fix the bug, the date_range() method call within the _get_time_bins() function needs to be modified to handle the ambiguous timestamp.

The corrected code for the problematic function, including the fix, is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Modified date_range() call to handle ambiguous timestamp
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Set ambiguous parameter to NaT to handle ambiguous timestamp
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The above fix sets the ambiguous parameter in the date_range() call to "NaT" to handle the ambiguous timestamp and prevent the AmbiguousTimeError. This correction resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and should also pass the failing test.
