The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` causes an AmbiguousTimeError when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. The issue is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps on days with clock changes, such as November 4th, where midnight local time is ambiguous.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of timestamps on clock change days, particularly in the lines where `binner` and `labels` are defined.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly when generating bins and labels for grouping. This leads to the AmbiguousTimeError when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on days with clock changes.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly. This can be achieved by properly adjusting the labels to account for ambiguous timestamps and by ensuring that the bins and labels are generated appropriately for days with clock changes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function, including the necessary modifications to handle the AmbiguousTimeError:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function properly handles ambiguous timestamps and ensures that the bins and labels are generated correctly for days with clock changes, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
