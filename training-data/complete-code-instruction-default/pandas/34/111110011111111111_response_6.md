The bug in the function seems to occur because when the time bins are being created, an AmbiguousTimeError is raised due to an ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change in Cuba. This is likely caused by incorrect handling of the timestamps when creating the bins.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_time_bins` needs to be modified to properly handle the creation of time bins and to avoid raising an AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

The modification includes using `ambiguous="infer"` when creating the time range to handle ambiguous times during the clock change day. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError that was occurring before.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the provided input/output variable information, successfully resolving the GitHub issue.
