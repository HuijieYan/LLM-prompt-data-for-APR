The issue stems from the `_get_time_bins` method within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. This method is called by the failing test and is related to other methods within the same class such as `_adjust_bin_edges`. The failing test produces an `AmbiguousTimeError` which indicates that midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp and is not handled correctly by the `pd.Grouper` method.

The cause of the bug is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during time grouping, specifically on days when there is a clock change in the time zone.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` method needs to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps more effectively, taking into account days when there is a clock change in the time zone.

The following approach can be taken to fix the bug:
1. Identify the location within the `_get_time_bins` method where the handling of ambiguous timestamps can be improved.
2. Implement logic to handle ambiguous timestamps on days when there is a clock change in the time zone, ensuring that the grouping is done correctly without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. Update the logic to appropriately label the group for the day containing ambiguous timestamps.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code should handle ambiguous timestamps during time grouping more effectively, allowing the `pd.Grouper` method to work correctly on days when there is a clock change in the time zone. This solution should resolve the issue presented in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the failing test passes without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
