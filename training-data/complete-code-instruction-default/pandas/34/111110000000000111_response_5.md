1. The buggy function is part of a custom groupby class called `TimeGrouper` that is designed for time-interval grouping. The specific function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating time bins based on the frequency provided. The GitHub issue is related to a problem in the `pd.Grouper` when using daily frequency that leads to an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba. This error is related to handling ambiguous timestamps when there is a time change, for example, during daylight saving time transitions.

2. The potential error in the `_get_time_bins` function lies in the handling of timestamps around the time change, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

3. (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating time bins based on the frequency provided but seems to have issues when dealing with ambiguous timestamps.
   (b). The custom groupby class `TimeGrouper` and its functions are called by the buggy function.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a code sample that uses the `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency. On a clock change day in Cuba, there are ambiguous timestamps, and this leads to an AmbiguousTimeError, which is not handled as expected.

4. To fix the bug, one possible approach can be to handle the ambiguous timestamps explicitly, either by using time zone information or by handling the transition periods. Another approach could be to adjust the bin edges and labels based on the frequency and the timestamps.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the bin edges and labels are adjusted based on the axis values. Additionally, handling of ambiguous timestamps and time zone information may need to be incorporated to fully resolve the issue.
