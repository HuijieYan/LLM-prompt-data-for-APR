The issue is caused by a bug in the _get_time_bins function in the pandas library, which fails to handle ambiguous time on clock change days in certain timezones. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError when running tests with daily frequency on clock change days.

The expected behavior is that the call to groupby should return three groups, one for each day, and should handle ambiguous times correctly.

To address this bug, the _get_time_bins function should be modified to handle ambiguous times on clock change days. This can be achieved by adjusting how the bin edges are calculated and labels are assigned to ensure that ambiguous times are handled correctly.

Based on the provided input and error message, it appears that the issue is related to the timezone conversion and handling of ambiguous times during grouping. The error occurs on the day of the clock change in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to update the logic for calculating bin edges and labels in the _get_time_bins function to handle ambiguous times, specifically on clock change days. This might involve using different methods for defining the bins and labels to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.

Here is the corrected code for the _get_time_bins function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected function includes adjustments to the bin edges calculation and handling of ambiguous times to ensure that it can handle clock change days in certain timezones. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and make the function work as expected.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It is also expected to successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
