The bug in the provided function is likely due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days, which leads to an AmbiguousTimeError. The function is supposed to group timebins at a daily frequency, however, it fails to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly. This issue is also reflected in the GitHub issue, where a call to groupby raises the AmbiguousTimeError, specifically on clock change days in Cuba. The output is not as expected, and the daily grouping does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days more robustly, ensuring that the grouping is done correctly without throwing the AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps
    mask = binner.to_series().index.duplicated(keep='first')
    binner = binner[~mask]
    labels = binner[1:]

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, binner.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated function adds a step to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days by removing duplicate indices from the binner and labels. This should prevent the AmbiguousTimeError and correctly group the timebins at a daily frequency without issues.
