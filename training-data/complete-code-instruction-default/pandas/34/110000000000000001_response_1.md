1. The buggy function _get_time_bins() seems to be designed to handle datetime axis data, but there are potential issues with handling datetime indexes and binning the data properly.

2. The potential error location is in the section where the bin edges are being adjusted and the bins are being generated. There may also be issues with handling labels and bins correctly.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to issues in handling datetime indexes and binning the data properly, as well as potential issues with adjusting labels and bins.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the datetime index is properly handled and checked for validity
   - Reviewing the logic for adjusting bin edges and generating bins
   - Double-checking the handling of labels and bins to ensure they match correctly
   - Addressing potential issues with the use of NaT and the handling of NaN values

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = pd.date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.values
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
