The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the context of daylight saving time changes, particularly on days when the clock changes. The GitHub issue is related to a groupby operation with a daily frequency failing with an AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba.

To address this issue, we need to handle ambiguous timestamps more robustly, ensuring that the groupby operation does not raise an AmbiguousTimeError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the ambiguous timestamps explicitly, possibly by using an approach that assigns ambiguous timestamps to the desired label based on the closed and label parameters, and ensuring that the labels and bins are correctly adjusted to handle this ambiguity.

Below is the corrected code for the buggy function, with the necessary fixes to handle ambiguous timestamps:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Adjust for ambiguous timestamps and handle properly
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Correct handling of ambiguous timestamps
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected function includes explicit handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating the date range, adjustment of labels, and bins to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps, and ensuring that ambiguous timestamps do not raise an AmbiguousTimeError.

This corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
