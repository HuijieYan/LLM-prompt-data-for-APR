Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be related to the way the time bins are being created when using pd.Grouper(freq='1D'). The AmbiguousTimeError occurs when the code tries to group the data by day frequency on a day where daylight saving time change occurs, such as in the test case provided for Nov 4, 2018.

Bug's cause using:
(a) The buggy function: _get_time_bins shows the code responsible for creating time bins.
(b) The failing test and error message: The failing test demonstrates the issue occurring when grouping by day frequency on a day where daylight saving time change occurs, causing an AmbiguousTimeError.
(c) The GitHub Issue information: The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, along with the expected output and the version of pandas being used.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One potential approach for fixing the bug would be to handle the AmbiguousTimeError and adjust the code in _get_time_bins to properly handle daylight saving time changes and ambiguous timestamps. This may involve using the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters in pd.date_range to handle ambiguous and nonexistent times appropriately.

Another approach could be to provide a custom solution for time binning that takes daylight saving time changes into account.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, NaT, date_range

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="NaT", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected function aims to properly handle ambiguous and nonexistent times when creating time bins. By specifying `ambiguous="NaT"` and `nonexistent="shift_forward"` in the call to date_range, we can handle ambiguous and nonexistent times appropriately. Additionally, other adjustments are made to ensure proper handling of bins and labels. This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
