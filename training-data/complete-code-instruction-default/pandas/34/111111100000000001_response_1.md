Potential error location: The potential error is in the line "ax_values = ax.asi8" where "asi8" should be replaced with "asi8".

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function checks if the input "ax" is an instance of DatetimeIndex. If not, it raises a TypeError. This is the first potential issue.
(b). The related class TimeGrouper contains the buggy function and additional functions that are being called within the buggy function. There are calls to "_get_timestamp_range_edges" and "_adjust_bin_edges" within the buggy function which may potentially contribute to the bug.
(c). The related functions like "_get_timestamp_range_edges" and "_adjust_bin_edges" could also be contributing to the bug.

Approach for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by updating "ax.asi8" to "ax.values". Additionally, it's essential to ensure that the related functions called within the buggy function are also working correctly and are passing the right inputs.

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.values  # Fix: Replace ax.asi8 with ax.values
    
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
