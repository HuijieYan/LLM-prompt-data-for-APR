The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to return binner, bins, and labels. However, the calculations and assignments for these variables are incorrect, resulting in mismatched values and types.

The first issue is with the calculation of `last` and `first` which are derived from the return values of the function `_get_timestamp_range_edges`. The calculation of `last` seems to be incorrect due to a time zone mismatch.

Another problem is the calculation of `bin_edges` and `bins` using the function `lib.generate_bins_dt64`. The end result `bins` does not correspond to the expected shape and values.

To fix the issues, we need to ensure proper calculation of `last` and `first` based on the time zone. Additionally, `bin_edges` and `bins` should be computed accurately.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins` is provided below:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = _adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, closed=self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the function `_get_timestamp_range_edges` is called to properly calculate `first` and `last` based on the time zone. Additionally, adjustments are made to properly calculate `bin_edges` and `bins` using the function `lib.generate_bins_dt64`. Finally, the corrected values for `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` are returned as expected.
