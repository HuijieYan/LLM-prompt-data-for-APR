Analyzing the provided information, the bug seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous time in the `_get_time_bins` function, which is part of the `TimeGrouper` class. The failing test is related to a specific scenario with time zone conversion and ambiguous time.

The failing test is attempting to downsample data by using `pd.Grouper` with a frequency of "1D". The data contains timestamps that are tz-aware and from Cuba time zone, including a day with a DST time change. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised.

The GitHub issue provides detailed information about the expected behavior, the problem, and the current version of pandas being used.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle the ambiguous time scenario when creating the bins and labels for the grouper.

A possible fix for the bug could involve modifying the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times correctly and manage the time zone conversions more accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_utc = ax.tz_convert("UTC")  # Convert to UTC to avoid ambiguity
    ax_values = ax_utc.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax_utc, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Handle ambiguous times for labels
    labels = ax.tz_convert(None)
    labels = labels[~labels.duplicated()]

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the above correction, the `_get_time_bins` function should handle the ambiguous time scenario and avoid raising the `AmbiguousTimeError` when performing the groupby operation using `pd.Grouper`.
