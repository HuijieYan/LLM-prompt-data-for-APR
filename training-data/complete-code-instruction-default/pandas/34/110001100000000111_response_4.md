The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the `_get_time_bins` method, as this is the function mentioned in the GitHub issue, and it is responsible for grouping the data based on time bins.

The bug's cause arises from the fact that the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` in certain cases, as reported in the GitHub issue. This is likely related to the handling of time zones and the calculation of time bins within the function.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_time_bins` needs to be updated to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps and time zone conversions. This may involve modifying the calculation of time bins, the handling of ambiguous time, and the use of the `pd.Grouper` function.

Here is the corrected code for the function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = labels[:-1] if self.closed == "right" else labels
    labels = labels.insert(0, NaT) if ax.hasnans else labels

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code includes adjustments to the calculation of time bins, handling of ambiguous timestamps, and adjustments to the labels based on the closed status and presence of NaN values. These changes should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report related to ambiguous time errors.
