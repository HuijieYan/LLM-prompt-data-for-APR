The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method inside the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. This function is called during the test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` and is failing due to the error message: "AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times".

The potential error location within the function is identified in this line:
`binner, labels = date_range(...)`

The cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function is unable to handle the input data properly and is leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, the `date_range` function must be replaced with a method that can handle datetime data that might have repeated times due to daylight saving time changes. This will involve using a different approach to generate the bins and labels.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = ax.floor(self.freq)
    labels = binner.unique()

    bin_edges = np.append(labels, labels[-1] + np.asarray(self.freq))
    ax_values = ax.to_series().values.astype(np.int64, copy=False)
    binner, bins = get_bi(binner.asi8, ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = bins
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code:
- We have used the `floor` method to get the bin edges. This method correctly handles datetime data that may have repeated times due to daylight saving time changes.
- We have used the `unique` method to get unique labels.
- The `get_bi` method is used to generate bins and labels, accounting for the possibility of repeated times due to daylight saving time changes.

This corrected code should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
