The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely to be caused by a mismatch in the length of `bins` and `labels`. It seems that `labels` is being generated correctly, but then its length is adjusted to be the same as `bins`, which may cause discrepancies.

To fix the bug, we can adjust the length of `labels` based on the length of `bins` with the following possible approaches:
1. If `labels` should always be equal to or less than `bins`, we can just slice `labels` to match the length of `bins`.
2. If `labels` should always be equal to `bins`, we can handle the case where `labels` has less elements than `bins`.

Based on the provided information, we will assume the second approach, but adjustments may be needed based on the specific requirements of the class `TimeGrouper`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if labels has less elements than bins, pad the labels with NaT
    if len(labels) < len(bins):
        labels = labels.append([NaT] * (len(bins) - len(labels)))

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, we're handling the scenario where `labels` has fewer elements than `bins`, and padding the `labels` with `NaT` accordingly. This ensures that the length of `labels` matches the length of `bins`.
