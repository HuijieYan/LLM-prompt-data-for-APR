The problem in the function `pivot_table` arises from the `if` condition where it checks if the `table` is symmetrical. If it is not, it tries to select only the first column, assuming that it is a DataFrame. However, it does not consider the case where `table` is a Series.

The `'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'` error that is reported in the GitHub issue is indicative of this problem. The function is assuming `table` to have a `columns` attribute, which is causing the error in the case where `table` is a Series.

To fix this, we need to handle the case where the `table` is a Series separately and ensure that the appropriate operation is performed for both Series and DataFrame.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to check if `table` is a Series, and if so, convert it to a DataFrame with a single column before proceeding with the subsequent operations.

Here's the corrected `pivot_table` function that resolves this issue and satisfies the expected input/output variable information and the GitHub issue:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing code ...

    if not isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and isinstance(table, Series):
        table = table.to_frame()

    if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and \
       (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
        table = table[values[0]]

    # remaining code ...

    return table
```

This corrected function checks if `table` is a Series and converts it to a DataFrame using the `to_frame` method. Then, it proceeds with the subsequent operations, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and resolving the GitHub issue.
