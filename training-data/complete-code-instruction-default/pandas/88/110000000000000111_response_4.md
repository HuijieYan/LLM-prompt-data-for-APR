The buggy function is the `pivot_table` function in the pandas library. The GitHub issue describes a situation where the function throws an AttributeError when attempting to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the section where it checks if the `table.columns.nlevels > 1` and then tries to access `table[values[0]]`. This section is likely causing the AttributeError when the DataFrame has multi-index columns.

The bug is caused by an incorrect assumption about the structure of the `table` object when dealing with multi-index columns. The function expects `table` to always be a DataFrame, but when multi-index columns are present, it may actually be a Series.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly account for the possibility of `table` being a Series when multi-index columns are present. It should also handle the indexing operation differently depending on whether `table` is a Series or a DataFrame.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing code ...

    # existing code ...

        # existing code ...

        table = agged

        if isinstance(table, Series):
            table = DataFrame(table)

        if table.index.nlevels > 1:
            # Related GH #17123
            # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
            # to the level position or name.
            index_names = table.index.names[: len(index)]
            to_unstack = []
            for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
                name = table.index.names[i]
                if name is None or name in index_names:
                    to_unstack.append(i)
                else:
                    to_unstack.append(name)
            table = table.unstack(to_unstack)
        
        # existing code ...
        
    # existing code ...

    return table
```

The corrected code includes a check for whether `table` is a Series, and if so, it is converted to a DataFrame before further processing. This ensures that the function operates correctly even when dealing with multi-index columns.
