The buggy function is `pivot_table` which is from the `pandas` library. The function seems to be recursive and, when `aggfunc` is a list, it calls itself multiple times with the same parameters except for `aggfunc`. This might cause an infinite recursion.

The error message indicates that the function is returning a `Series` instead of a `DataFrame`, and it is trying to access a non-existent `columns` attribute, which is causing an `AttributeError`.

The potential error location within the function is identified as the part where it checks the condition `if isinstance(aggfunc, list):` and then calls `table = pivot_table(...` recursively. This is where the recursion issue might be happening.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle a list of aggregation functions without making recursive calls to itself. Instead, we can iterate through the list of `aggfunc` and perform the aggregation separately, and then combine the results.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # code to handle the case when aggfunc is a list
    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            # perform aggregation separately for each function
            agged = data.pivot_table(
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        # combine the results into a single DataFrame
        table = pd.concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)
    else:
        # original implementation for single aggfunc
        index = _convert_by(index)
        columns = _convert_by(columns)
        # ... rest of the function remains unchanged

    return table
```

This corrected code handles the case when `aggfunc` is a list by performing aggregation separately for each function in the list and then combining the results into a single `DataFrame`. This should fix the issue of infinite recursion and also ensure that the function returns a `DataFrame` as expected.
