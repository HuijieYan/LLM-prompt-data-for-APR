The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the recursion of the `pivot_table` function when `aggfunc` is a list. This leads to incorrect results and potential infinite recursion.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle the case where `aggfunc` is a list differently. Instead of calling the `pivot_table` function recursively, we can first check the type of `aggfunc` and handle the list case separately before performing the aggregation.

The corrected code for the function is provided below:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            # Perform aggregation for each function in the list
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        # Concatenate the results
        table = concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)
    else:
        # Perform aggregation directly if aggfunc is not a list
        keys = index + columns
        grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
        table = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

By modifying the function to handle the case where `aggfunc` is a list separately, we avoid the issue of infinite recursion and ensure that the correct aggregation is performed.

The corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
