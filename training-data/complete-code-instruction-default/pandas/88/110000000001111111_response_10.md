The issue is related to using the `pivot_table` function with multi-index columns, where the bug causes an AttributeError due to a Series object not having the attribute 'columns'.

Based on the input/output variable information and the GitHub issue, the potential error location is identified as the section of `pivot_table` function which checks if the table is empty and has multiple levels, causing the error when attempting to access the columns attribute on a Series object.

The cause of the bug is due to mistakenly treating a Series object as a DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the code inside the `pivot_table` function should be modified to ensure that the table is properly handled as a DataFrame in all cases. Specifically, when the table is a Series, it needs to be converted to a DataFrame before performing any operations that require DataFrame attributes. 

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (existing code)

    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = table.to_frame()  # Convert Series to DataFrame

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = agged.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)

    # ... (existing code)

    return table
```

The updated code includes a check to convert the Series to a DataFrame if the table is a Series object. This ensures that subsequent operations are performed on a DataFrame to avoid the AttributeError.

With these changes, the corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
