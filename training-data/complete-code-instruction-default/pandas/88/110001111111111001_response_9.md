### Issue Analysis
Looking at the error message and the failing test, it is clear that the `pivot_table` function is dealing with `cols` as a `tuple` for column names, each of which may include numeric values. However, this approach is leading to an error due to a discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable value.

### Bug Cause
The root cause of the issue is that the `pivot_table` function does not handle numeric column names properly when they are passed as part of a tuple.

### Possible Approaches
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the code to handle and process the numeric column names appropriately when passed as part of tuples.
2. Ensure that the `pivot_table` function can accept both string and numeric column names provided as tuples.

### Corrected Code
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = [str(col) for col in columns]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ... (Rest of the function)

    return table
```

The corrected code includes a modification to handle numeric column names when passed as part of tuples by converting them to strings as required. This corrected code should address the bug and make the function compatible with the failing test cases.
