The issue in the provided function seems to be arising from the condition `table.columns.nlevels > 1`, leading to an `AttributeError` when attempting to access the `columns` attribute of a Series object.

The bug seems to stem from the conditional check for `table.columns.nlevels > 1` when 'table' is a Series object. This conditional check should only be executed when 'table' is a DataFrame.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the conditional check to only apply when 'table' is a DataFrame, as accessing the 'columns' attribute in a Series object will result in an AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # ... (existing code)

    # Modify the conditional check to only apply when 'table' is a DataFrame
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table[values[0]]  # Discard the top level

    # ... (existing code)

    return table
```

This fix ensures that the conditional check `table.columns.nlevels > 1` is only executed when 'table' is a DataFrame, thereby preventing the AttributeError when 'table' is a Series object.

This corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
