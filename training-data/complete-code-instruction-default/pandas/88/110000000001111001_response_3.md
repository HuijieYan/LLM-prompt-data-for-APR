The bug seems to be caused by recursive call to the `pivot_table` function within the function itself, which causes an infinite loop and incorrect output. The recursive call occurs when `aggfunc` is passed as a list, leading to the function calling itself with each function in the list and concatenating the results. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Removing the recursive call and using the `aggfunc` directly on the grouped data without calling the `pivot_table` function again.
- Ensuring that the function does not call itself when `aggfunc` is a list and instead processes multiple aggregations within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # Rest of the function remains the same until the recursive call to pivot_table
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)
   
    # Remaining code after the recursive call remains the same
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle multiple aggregations without the need for recursive calls. This should resolve the bug and produce the expected results for the given inputs in the test cases.
