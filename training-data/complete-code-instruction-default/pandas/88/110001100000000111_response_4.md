The issue is caused by the `df2.pivot_table(values='v', columns=('k1','k2'))` call, specifically due to the `if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)` condition in the `pivot_table` function. At this point, `table` is a Series object, and Series objects do not have a `columns` attribute, hence causing the `AttributeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `pivot_table` function to handle the case when `table` is a Series object correctly. We can do this by checking the type of `table` and handling the Series and DataFrame objects separately.

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (previous function body)

    # Modify the following if condition
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
        table = table[values[0]]  # Handling DataFrame
    elif isinstance(table, ABCSeries) and table.index.nlevels > 1:
        table = DataFrame(table, columns=[table.name])  # Handling Series
    
    # ... (remaining function body)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle the case of a Series object as `table` and convert it to a DataFrame by creating a new DataFrame from the Series. This resolves the AttributeError caused by trying to access the `columns` attribute of a Series object. The function should now behave as expected in the provided GitHub issue example.
