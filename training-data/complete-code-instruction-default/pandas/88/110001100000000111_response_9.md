The buggy function `pivot_table` is causing an AttributeError when used with multi-index columns. This error occurs due to an incorrect implementation of checking the number of levels in the table's columns. The GitHub issue titled "BUG/API: pivot_table with multi-index columns only" provides a clear description of the problem and the expected output.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the section where it checks for the number of levels in the table's columns:

```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
    table = table[values[0]]
```

This code snippet checks for the number of levels in the table's columns, and if it is greater than 1, it tries to access the first value, resulting in an AttributeError when `table` is a Series.

To fix the bug, this section of code needs to be rewritten to handle both Series and DataFrame objects appropriately. Additionally, the code should be modified to ensure symmetrical behavior between rows/columns and single/multi-case.

The following corrected code addresses these issues:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if values_passed:
        if len(values) == 1 and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            table = table[values[0]]

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    return table
```

In this corrected code, a check is added to verify if there is only one value and if the table's columns have more than one level before accessing the first value. If both conditions are met, it then accesses the value. This fix will prevent the AttributeError while ensuring the expected behavior for both single and multi-index cases.
