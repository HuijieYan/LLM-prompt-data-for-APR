The buggy function is the `pivot_table` function from the `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` file. The error is occurring when the `columns` parameter given to the function has tuples with multiple elements.

The root cause of the problem is that the function is assuming that `columns` is a list, and is not handling the case where it is a tuple.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that `columns` is always converted to a list within the function before further processing.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = list(columns)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this change, the function should now handle cases where `columns` is passed as tuples, as in the failing tests mentioned. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
