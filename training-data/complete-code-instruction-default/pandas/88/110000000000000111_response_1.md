# The buggy function pivot_table has a bug that causes an AttributeError when using multi-index columns. The issue is related to the code attempting to access the column names using table.columns.nlevels. This code is intended to handle the case where the pivot_table has multiple levels in the columns index, but it mistakenly assumes that the result is always a DataFrame, leading to the AttributeError when a Series is returned instead.

The bug is caused by the assumption that the result of the pivot_table will always be a DataFrame, leading to unexpected behavior when a Series is returned, especially in the case of multi-index columns.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to handle both DataFrame and Series results from the pivot_table function. Conditional checks need to be added to ensure that the code operates correctly regardless of the return type.

Here's the corrected code for the pivot_table function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # ... (existing code remains unchanged)

    # ... (existing code remains unchanged)

    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):  # Added conditional check for DataFrame
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table._ensure_type(table.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer"))

    if margins:
        # ... (existing code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):  # Added conditional check for DataFrame
        table = table.dropna(how="all", axis=1)

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):  # Added conditional check for DataFrame
        if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            m = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
                cartesian_product(table.columns.levels), names=table.columns.names
            )
            table = table.reindex(m, axis=1)

    return table
```

The corrected code now includes conditional checks to handle both DataFrame and Series returns from the pivot_table function. This ensures that the function operates correctly in cases of multi-index columns and resolves the AttributeError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
