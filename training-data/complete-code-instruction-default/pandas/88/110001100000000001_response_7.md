1. The buggy function pivot_table in the pivot.py file in the pandas library is calling itself recursively when the aggfunc parameter is a list, leading to potential infinite recursion.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where the function recursively calls itself when aggfunc is a list.

3. The cause of the bug is the recursive call to pivot_table within the same function, when the aggfunc parameter is a list. This leads to infinite recursion and stack overflow. The related function _add_margins is also called within the buggy function, but it does not directly contribute to the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Redefining the logic for handling multiple aggfuncs without recursive calls.
   b. Restructuring the code to avoid recursive calls when aggfunc is a list.

5. Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

In the corrected code, the section that previously led to infinite recursion has been replaced with a new approach that loops through the aggfunc list and performs the aggregation without recursively calling pivot_table. This fixes the bug and ensures that the function behaves as intended.
