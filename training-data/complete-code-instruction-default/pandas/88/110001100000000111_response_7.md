Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions and the GitHub issue, it appears that the error is occurring due to incorrect handling of multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function. The issue has been identified as a bug in the `pivot_table` function when using multi-index columns, as indicated by the GitHub issue title and description. The error is specifically related to the condition `table.columns.nlevels > 1` causing an `AttributeError` when `values` is not multi-index.

The bug seems to be caused by inadequate handling of multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function, leading to errors when trying to access `table.columns` in cases where the `values` is not multi-index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Ensuring proper handling of multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function to avoid the AttributeError when accessing `table.columns`.
2. Implementing appropriate checks for multi-index columns before attempting to access properties like `nlevels` on `columns`.

To fix the bug, the following corrected code for the problematic function can be applied:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # Rest of the original code follows...
    ...
    ...
    ...

    if not isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and not table.empty and values_passed and not values_multi and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table[values[0]]

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    # GH 15193 Make sure empty columns are removed if dropna=True
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and dropna:
        table = table.dropna(how="all", axis=1)

    return table
```

This corrected code ensures proper handling of multi-index columns and includes appropriate checks before accessing properties like `nlevels` on `columns`, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
