The buggy function is a part of the pandas library in Python. The function 'pivot_table' is used to create a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame. The GitHub issue titled "BUG/API: pivot_table with multi-index columns only" indicates that there is an AttributeError when calling the pivot_table function with multi-index columns.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the line:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
```
This line is trying to access 'table.columns' assuming it's a DataFrame, but if 'table' is a Series object, it will result in an AttributeError because Series objects do not have a 'columns' attribute.

The bug is caused by the fact that the code does not take into consideration that 'table' can be a Series object in some cases. When 'table' is a Series, the 'table.columns' attribute does not exist, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle both DataFrame and Series objects. We can use the isinstance() function to check if 'table' is a DataFrame or a Series, and then perform the necessary operations accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the pivot_table function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    if values_passed:
        # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    else:
        # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

        for v in values:
            # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    table = agged
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    if not dropna:
        # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table._ensure_type(table.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer"))

    if margins:
        # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    # Discard the top level if table is a Series instead of a DataFrame
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and not table.empty and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table[values[0]]

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and dropna:
        table = table.dropna(how="all", axis=1)

    return table
```

In the corrected code, we have added a conditional check to handle the case where 'table' is a Series instead of a DataFrame. If 'table' is a Series, we only select the first value and discard the top level.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and handle the AttributeError when 'table' is a Series.
