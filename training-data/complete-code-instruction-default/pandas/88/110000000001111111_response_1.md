The issue is originating from the implementation of the `pivot_table` function when the `columns` parameter consists of multiple index values.

In the given function, the problem area is identified with the conditional check for `table.columns.nlevels > 1`, which is causing the AttributeError when the columns have multiple index levels.

The bug is caused because the function is trying to access the `.columns` attribute of the `table` variable, which results in an AttributeError when `table` is a Series object. This occurs when columns have multiple index levels, and the operation should not be performed on a Series in that context.

To fix this bug, the conditional check for `table.columns.nlevels > 1` should be handled according to the type of the `table` variable. If `table` is a DataFrame, the conditional check should proceed. If it is a Series, the logic should be adapted to accommodate the multi-index situation.

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # Existing code...

    if not isinstance(table, Series) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table[values[0]]

    # Existing code...
    
    return table
```

By adding the conditional check `not isinstance(table, Series)`, we ensure that the operation is only performed when `table` is a DataFrame. If it is a Series, the conditional block will be skipped, preventing the AttributeError.

With this fix, the conditional check will be handled appropriately based on the type of the `table` variable, resolving the issue and allowing the function to work correctly with multiple index levels in columns.
