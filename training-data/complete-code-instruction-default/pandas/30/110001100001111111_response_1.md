A potential error location in the problematic function can be identified where the condition to check if the new_data.dtype is "object" is not followed by any change in the data type. This may lead to issues when attempting to convert the data to int64.

The bug's cause can be elucidated by examining the buggy function and its relationship with related functions. Additionally, the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values provided in the GitHub issue can be analyzed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adding proper data type conversion after checking if the new_data.dtype is "object" and handling exceptions more appropriately during the conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also aims to resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
