The issue seems to arise from the `_try_convert_to_date` function incorrectly converting boolean values to datetime objects. The function has several issues, including incorrectly checking for empty data and attempting to convert boolean values to dates. 

The function has a logical error when checking for empty data, and it also incorrectly tries to convert boolean values to int64. Additionally, the function incorrectly attempts to check if the data contains numerical values that are out of range, which is unnecessary for the input data types. 

To fix the function, the logical errors in the checks need to be addressed, and the conversion of boolean values to datetime needs to be removed.

The corrected complete function would be as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if data.empty:
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected function removes unnecessary checks and conversions for boolean data types, and correctly handles the conversion of other data types to datetime objects. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
