1. The buggy function "_try_convert_to_date" is related to the GitHub issue because it is responsible for parsing a ndarray-like input into a date column. The issue is related to the incorrect parsing of data when using the "read_json" function with typ="series" of a json list of bools.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic used to convert the input data into a datetime format. This logic is causing the incorrect conversion of boolean values into timestamps.

3. (a). The buggy function attempts to parse the input data into datetime format using the to_datetime function, but the logic is not handling boolean values correctly.

   (b). The GitHub issue explains that the read_json function with typ="series" of a json list of bools is resulting in a Series of timestamps instead of a Series of bools. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check in the _try_convert_to_date function to handle boolean values separately and avoid attempting to convert them to datetime.
   - Ensuring that the function returns a Series of bools when the input data is a list of bools.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
  
    if isinstance(data, list) and all(isinstance(x, bool) for x in data):
        return data, True

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a check for when the input data is a list of bools, in which case it returns the input data as is with a boolean flag set to True. This will ensure that the function returns a Series of bools when the input data is a list of bools, as expected in the GitHub issue.
