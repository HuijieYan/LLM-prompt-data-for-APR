1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it is responsible for converting input data into a date column. The issue on GitHub is related to `pd.read_json()` causing unexpected behavior when `typ="series"`.

2. The potential error location within the function is when trying to convert the input data into date formats and coercing object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. This coercion is causing unexpected behavior when dealing with boolean values.

3. The bug is caused because the function is trying to parse boolean values as dates, and unable to do so, resulting in the incorrect output of timestamps or exceptions as discussed in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the dtype of the input data and handling boolean values separately to avoid coercion into date formats
   - Adding a condition to handle boolean values and return them as is, without attempting to convert them

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if is_bool_dtype(data):
        return data, True

    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(data) | (data > self.min_stamp) | (data == pd.NaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function checks if the input data is of boolean type, and if it is, it returns the data as is without attempting to convert it. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
