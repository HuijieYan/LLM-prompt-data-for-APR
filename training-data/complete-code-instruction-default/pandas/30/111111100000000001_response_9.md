Potential Error:
The potential error in this function seems to be in the if condition where it checks for the dtype of the input data. This could be causing issues with the date conversion process.

Bug's Cause:
The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of data type conversion and date parsing. The function attempts to convert the input data to int64 dtype, but this may not cover all possible date formats.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can revise the logic for data type conversion and date parsing. This may involve using a more robust method for detecting and parsing date formats, as well as handling error conditions more effectively.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.missing import iNaT
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime64_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import isna
from pandas.core.tools.datetimes import to_datetime

class Parser():

    # Corrected version of the function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="coerce", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except Exception as e:
            return data, False
```
The corrected function now uses the `to_datetime` function directly to parse the input data into date formats, with error handling to handle any exceptions. This simplifies the logic and potentially resolves the issues with data type conversion and date parsing.
