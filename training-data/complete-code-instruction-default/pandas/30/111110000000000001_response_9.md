1. The buggy function is within a class called Parser. It seems to be trying to convert data into a date column with some error handling, but there are issues with the data type conversion and date parsing logic.

2. The potential error locations within the function include the data type conversion using `astype("int64")` and the date parsing using `to_datetime`.

3. The issues in the buggy function are caused by incorrect data type conversion and improper date parsing logic. The function seems to be trying to handle different data types and date formats, but the logic for handling these cases is not implemented correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve refining the logic for data type conversion and date parsing, handling different data types and date formats more systematically, and ensuring that error handling is comprehensive and accurately identifies and handles different types of errors that can occur during the conversion and parsing processes.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```
In the corrected function, the logic for data type conversion using `astype("int64")` has been fixed to use `new_data.astype("int64")`, and the date parsing using `to_datetime` has been updated to handle errors and return the parsed date data along with a boolean indicating parsing success. Additionally, the handling of out of range numbers has been improved.
