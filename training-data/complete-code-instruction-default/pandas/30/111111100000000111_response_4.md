The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is causing the issue described in the GitHub problem. This function is responsible for trying to parse an ndarray into a date column, but it is converting Boolean values into timestamps, which is not the expected behavior.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where it checks for dtype and casts the data to int64 if it is of type "object". This is likely where the Boolean values are being converted incorrectly.

The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly converting Boolean values into timestamps, while it should be returning a Series of Boolean values.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to return a Series of Boolean values if the input data is of type "bool".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            if data.dtype == "bool":
                return data, True  # Return data as is if it's a boolean type

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code checks for the dtype of the data and if it's "bool", it returns the data as is with a flag indicating success. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem.
