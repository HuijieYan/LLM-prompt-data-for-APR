1. The buggy function is intended to parse a pandas dataframe into a date column, but it is incorrectly converting boolean values into timestamps. This is related to the GitHub issue as it mentions an error when using pd.read_json with typ="series" resulting in timestamps instead of boolean values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of boolean values, which should not be converted to timestamps.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly distinguish boolean values from other data types, leading to incorrect conversion to timestamps. This is in line with the GitHub issue, as it also mentions the incorrect conversion of boolean values to timestamps.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a condition to check for boolean values and handle them separately from other data types.
   - Adjusting the data type conversion logic to correctly identify and process boolean values.
   - Ensuring that the function returns a pandas Series of boolean values when encountering boolean data.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype, is_integer, is_object_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if len(data) == 0:
        return data, False

    if is_object_dtype(data):
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='raise')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    else:
        new_data = data

    if is_integer(new_data):
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='ignore', unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True

    if is_bool_dtype(new_data):
        return new_data, True
    else:
        return data, False
```

This corrected function checks for boolean values and handles them separately, ensuring that boolean values are returned as a pandas Series of boolean values. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
