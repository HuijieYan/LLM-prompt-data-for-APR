The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it checks for the data type and tries to convert to int64. It then tries to check for range and convert to datetime, but it does not handle all the possible exceptions that may occur during these operations.

The bug's cause is due to insufficient error handling in the function. When trying to convert the data to int64 or datetime, if there are any exceptions raised, the function does not handle them properly. This can lead to the function returning incorrect or unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to include comprehensive error handling for each operation it performs. This includes handling exceptions raised during data type conversion, range checking, and datetime conversion. Additionally, it should take into account all possible scenarios that may cause the function to return an incorrect result, and handle them accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_numeric_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime64_any_dtype
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import isna
from pandas.tseries.tools import to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    try:
        new_data = data.astype("int64")
    except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
        new_data = data

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if is_numeric_dtype(new_data):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == np.iinfo(np.int64).max)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if not is_datetime64_any_dtype(new_data):
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, TypeError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, we added comprehensive error handling for data type conversion, range checking, and datetime conversion. We also handled all possible exceptions that may occur during these operations. Additionally, we used the appropriate functions from the pandas library for data type checking and datetime conversion.
