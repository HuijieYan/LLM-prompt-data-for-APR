Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the attempt to convert boolean values into datetime. This is problematic because the function should be trying to parse boolean values into boolean columns, not date columns.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the attempt to coerce boolean values into date columns, which results in a TypeError when using `read_json` with `typ="series"` of a json list of bools. This causes the function to produce a Series of timestamps or raise an exception instead of the expected Series of boolean values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the function to handle boolean values properly and coerce them into boolean columns instead of date columns.
2. Check for boolean dtype and handle it appropriately without attempting to convert it to date.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            if new_data.all() in [True, False]:  # check for boolean values
                return new_data.astype(bool), True  # coerce to boolean column
        
        return new_data, False
```

This corrected code will prevent the function from attempting to coerce boolean values into date columns and will instead handle boolean values appropriately.
