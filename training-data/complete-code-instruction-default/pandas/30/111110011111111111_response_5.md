The problem is that the function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert boolean Series data into datetime, which is causing the TypeError. This is not the intended behavior when the `typ="series"` parameter is used in the `read_json` function.

To fix this bug, the function `_try_convert_to_date` should check for boolean data and return it as is, without attempting to convert it to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    
    # this is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if pd.api.types.is_bool_dtype(new_data):  # check if data is boolean
            return new_data, False

        # other checks and conversions
        # ...

``` 

This corrected function checks if the input data is of boolean type and if it is, it returns the data as is, without attempting any datetime conversion. This will fix the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue. It will also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

Hope this helps!
