The issue seems to be related to the function `_try_convert_to_date` where it tries to parse an ndarray into a date column but ends up returning a boolean series with timestamp values.

The potential error location within the function could be where it checks for the dtype of new_data and tries to convert it to int64. This conversion seems to be incorrect and is causing issues with the date conversion logic.

The bug's cause seems to be the incorrect handling of dtype conversion and the subsequent date parsing logic. This is evident from the input/output variable value information where the dtype conversion does not seem to produce the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the dtype conversion is performed correctly and the date parsing logic is also handled appropriately. We should also handle the case of boolean data separately to avoid any conflicts with date parsing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime64_any_dtype as is_datetime

class ClassName:
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if not is_datetime(data):
            if new_data.dtype == "bool":
                return data, False
            elif new_data.dtype == "int64":
                # try to handle epoch formats
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, unit='s', errors='ignore')

        return new_data, True
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly convert the input data to a date column without causing any issues. It should also address the problem mentioned in the GitHub issue where boolean values were incorrectly converted to timestamps.
