The issue here seems to be with the way the `new_data` variable is being modified and handled. It seems that in both cases, the `new_data` variable should be modified and updated based on certain conditions, and then the correct value of `new_data` should be returned in the end.

It seems like the variable `new_data` is being incorrectly assigned the value of `data`, and that assignment should be removed. Additionally, the logic to set `new_data` to the result of converting `data` to integer if it is of type "object" should be nested within a condition that checks if the dtype is object. Finally, before returning the `new_data` variable, it should be checked if it is within the range specified by `self.min_stamp`. 

A possible approach to fix the bug would be as follows:
1. Remove the assignment `new_data = data` and replace it with `new_data = data.copy()`.
2. Wrap the logic to set `new_data` to the result of converting `data` to integer if it is of type "object" within a condition that checks if the dtype is object.
3. Check if `new_data` is within the specified range before returning it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False
    
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
