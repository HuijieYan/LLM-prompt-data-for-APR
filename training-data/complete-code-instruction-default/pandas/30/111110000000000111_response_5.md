1. The buggy function is part of the `Parser` class and is responsible for converting data into a date column. The GitHub issue is related to the `read_json` method in Pandas, which is not properly converting boolean values to a series and instead returning a series of timestamps. This issue is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function treating boolean values as potential dates.

2. The potential error location within the `_try_convert_to_date` function lies in the section that is trying to coerce object types into integer formats, ignoring numbers that are out of range, and parsing the data into datetime formats.

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a) The `_try_convert_to_date` function incorrectly handles boolean values and tries to convert them into date formats, which results in the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
   (b) The `Parser` class may not be handling boolean values properly when converting to date formats, and this behavior is likely causing the issue.
   (c) The GitHub issue describes how the `read_json` method is expected to return a series of boolean values but instead results in a series of timestamps or an exception, highlighting the inconsistency and expectations of users.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a condition in the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values separately and avoid attempting to convert them to date formats.
   - Modify the logic in the `Parser` class to handle boolean values appropriately when converting to date formats.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function that addresses the issue:

```python
class Parser():
    # ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == "bool":  # Handle boolean values separately
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
``` 

By adding a condition to handle boolean values separately and returning them without attempting to convert to date formats, the issue reported in the GitHub problem description would be resolved.
