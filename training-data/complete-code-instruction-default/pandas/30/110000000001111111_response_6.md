The bug in the provided function is that it is incorrectly converting boolean values into timestamps instead of retaining them as boolean values. This is causing the function to return an incorrect result, leading to a TypeError when used in certain scenarios, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it attempts to convert boolean values into timestamps.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling boolean values correctly, and the conversion code is causing the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle boolean values separately and ensure that they are retained as boolean values, rather than being converted to timestamps.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that satisfies the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    # Handle boolean values separately
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, True

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

With the corrected code, the `_try_convert_to_date` function will correctly handle boolean values and retain them as boolean values, thereby resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
