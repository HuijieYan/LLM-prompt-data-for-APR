1. The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date` which is part of the `Parser` class in the `pandas/io/json/_json.py` file. This function is called when trying to parse a JSON file into a Pandas dataframe or series, and it attempts to convert data to a date column.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block of code where it tries to convert the data to a date using the `to_datetime` function. The error message indicates that the function is trying to convert a boolean value to a datetime, which is not possible.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_try_convert_to_date` function does not handle boolean values properly when trying to convert the data to a date. This causes an error when attempting to read a JSON list of boolean values as a series.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a condition to check for boolean values and handle them differently when converting to a date.
   - Ensure that the function can handle boolean values and prevent them from being converted to a date.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # Ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected code, an additional condition has been added to handle boolean values, ensuring that they are not converted to a date. This fixed function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
