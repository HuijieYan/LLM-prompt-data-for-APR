Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error is likely occurring in the `_try_convert_to_date` function due to the boolean values in the input data that are being mistakenly interpreted as timestamps. This is likely happening because the function is attempting to convert boolean values to dates using the `to_datetime` function, which is leading to the TypeError.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function has a conditional check for converting boolean data to dates which should be removed.
(b). The failing test involves reading a JSON array of boolean values as a Series, which is resulting in a TypeError due to an attempt to convert boolean values to datetime. This should result in a Series with boolean values instead.
(c). The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values stem from the buggy conversion of boolean values to datetime.
(d). The GitHub issue information confirms that the expected output should be a Series of boolean values when reading boolean data from JSON.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean data appropriately and avoid attempting to convert it to datetime. 
2. Update the function to correctly return a Series with boolean values when the input data is of type boolean.

The corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    # Return the data as is with a success flag for boolean data
    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, True
    
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected code returns the input data as is with a success flag for boolean data. This resolves the issue with the TypeError and ensures that boolean values are handled appropriately.
