Analysis:

1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method within the pandas `JsonReader` class that attempts to parse a numpy array like object into a date column. The function first checks if the input data is empty, and if not, it attempts to coerce the data into an integer format. Then it ignores numbers that are out of range and tries to convert the data into a datetime object.

2. The GitHub issue refers to the problem that occurs when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` and providing a JSON list of booleans. The result in older versions of Pandas is a Series of timestamps, while in newer versions, it raises a `TypeError` stating that `<class 'bool'>` is not convertible to datetime.

3. Cause of the bug:

a. The `_try_convert_to_date` function attempts to convert the input data into a datetime object regardless of the type of data. In the case of a list of booleans, this conversion should not occur. This is the main cause of the bug.

b. The related functions in the `JsonReader` class also handle data conversion and type checking, but the specific handling for boolean data in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is lacking.

c. The GitHub issue provides information about the expected output, the pasted output of `pd.show_versions()`, and the behavior of the function in different versions of Pandas.

Approach for fixing the bug:

The main approach to fixing the bug is to add a check for boolean data in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, and if the input data is of boolean type, it should not be attempted to convert it into a datetime object.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if is_bool_dtype(data):  # Add a check for boolean data
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
By adding a check for boolean data at the beginning of the function, we can bypass the conversion process and directly return the original data as well as a boolean indicating that the conversion was not successful. This resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
