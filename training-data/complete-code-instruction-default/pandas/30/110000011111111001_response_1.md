1. The buggy function is trying to parse data into a date column and handle different data types such as arrays, numbers, and object types. The failing test is trying to read a JSON with boolean values and convert it into a Series, which triggers the TypeError when the function tries to convert boolean values to datetime.

2. The potential error is in the try_convert_to_date function where it is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling boolean values properly. It is expecting to convert a variety of types to datetime, but boolean values are not convertible to datetime, leading to the TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a condition to check if the data type is boolean, and if so, return the original data and False (indicating parsing was not successful).
   - This condition should be added before trying to convert the data to datetime.
   - Update the function to handle boolean values separately, as they are not compatible with the datetime conversion.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected function
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if is_bool_dtype(new_data):
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False

```

With this corrected function, boolean values are handled separately and returned as False, indicating that parsing was not successful, which satisfies the failing test and expected input/output variable information.
