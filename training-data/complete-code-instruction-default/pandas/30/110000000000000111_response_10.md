1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it attempts to convert a list of boolean values to dates, resulting in an error when it should not be doing so. The GitHub issue is related to the unexpected output of the `pd.read_json` function when `typ="series"` is used to read a JSON list of boolean values, leading to a Series of timestamps instead of boolean values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `to_datetime` function, which is trying to convert the boolean values into timestamps.

3. The buggy function is attempting to convert boolean values into timestamps using the `to_datetime` function, which causes the unexpected output of timestamps instead of boolean values. This is also in line with the GitHub issue, where the user expects a Series of boolean values but gets a Series of timestamps instead.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the dtype of the input data and only attempting to convert it to datetime if it is not boolean.
   - Changing the logic to handle boolean values separately and return the original data without conversion if it contains boolean values.
   - Making sure the function only parses the data as dates if it is in a compatible format.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the input data is of boolean type and directly returns the data without any conversion if it is. This resolves the issue of getting timestamps instead of boolean values when the input is a list of boolean values.
