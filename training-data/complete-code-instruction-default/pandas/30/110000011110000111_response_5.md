1. The problematic function "_try_convert_to_date" is used to parse an ndarray like into a date column. It tries to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. The failing test "test_readjson_bool_series" sets the typ parameter to "series" and passes a JSON with boolean values to the function read_json, which internally calls "_try_convert_to_date", resulting in a TypeError when trying to convert boolean values to datetime. The GitHub issue reports the problem with the read_json function when typ="series" is used with a JSON list of bools.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the line:
```python
new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
``` 
This line tries to convert the new_data to datetime, which leads to a TypeError when the input is of type bool.

3. The bug is caused by the function's inability to handle boolean values when trying to convert to datetime. This problem is highlighted by the failing test which expects the result to be a Series of bools, not timestamps. The GitHub issue further explains that this behavior is inconsistent with the "frame" case and provides the expected output. 

4. Possible approaches to fix the bug:
   (i) Add a conditional check to handle boolean values separately before attempting to convert to datetime.
   (ii) Update the function to handle different data types correctly based on the "typ" parameter.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        except AttributeError:
            if all(isinstance(x, (bool, np.bool_)) for x in data):
                return pd.Series(data), True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function includes a conditional check to handle boolean values separately before attempting to convert to datetime. It checks if the data is of type "object" and comprises only boolean values, in which case it directly returns a pandas Series of the boolean values, and the function returns True. This approach ensures that boolean values are handled correctly and the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
