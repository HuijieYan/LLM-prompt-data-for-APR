The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is used to parse an ndarray into a date column, but it is currently not working as expected. It is failing tests where the input `data` is of type `RangeIndex` and `Series`.

The issue arises from the handling of the `new_data` and `in_range` variables. The function is not correctly converting the data to a new format and not performing the necessary checks for dates that are out of range.

To fix this issue, we need to properly convert the `new_data` to the desired format and correctly check for dates that are out of range.

A possible fix for the `_try_convert_to_date` function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    # ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This fixed code ensures that the `new_data` is correctly converted to the desired format and the checks for dates that are out of range are performed accurately.

The fix will resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report related to parsing JSON data as described in the detailed description. The fix will ensure that the expected output of the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` will be a Pandas Series of bools, which is consistent with the behavior of `typ="frame"` and `convert_dates=False`.
