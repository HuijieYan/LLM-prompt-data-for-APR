1. The buggy function is a method within the Parser class, which is responsible for trying to parse a ndarray into a date column. The function attempts to coerce object types into int64 and then convert to datetime, but it has several issues such as not handling missing imports (numpy, isna, iNaT, to_datetime) and potential logic errors in identifying numbers out of range.

2. The potential error locations within the problematic function are the data type checks and the date range checks, as well as the exception handling for converting data to datetime.

3. (a). The buggy function tries to coerce object data types into int64 without proper error handling or checking for the presence of necessary libraries like numpy, which may cause the function to fail.
   (b). The buggy class does not handle potential errors when coercing object data types into int64 or when converting data into datetime, lacking proper exception handling.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Importing necessary libraries such as numpy and pandas within the class.
   - Adding proper error handling for coercing object data types into int64 and converting data into datetime.
   - Implementing logic to properly check for numbers out of range and handling missing values.

5. The corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser:
    
    def __init__(self, date_unit, min_stamp):
        self.date_unit = date_unit
        self.min_stamp = min_stamp
        self._STAMP_UNITS = ['ns', 'us', 'ms', 's', 'm', 'h']
        
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        if isinstance(new_data, np.ndarray): # Check if data is an ndarray
            if np.issubdtype(new_data.dtype, np.number):
                in_range = (
                    np.isnan(new_data) 
                    | (new_data > self.min_stamp) 
                    | (new_data == np.iinfo(np.int64).max)
                )
                if not in_range.all():
                    return data, False
            else:
                return data, False
        else:
            return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
In the corrected code, necessary libraries such as numpy and pandas are imported. Proper error handling and checks for numbers out of range have been implemented. Additionally, some improvements have been made to the logic to handle different types of data for proper conversion to date.
