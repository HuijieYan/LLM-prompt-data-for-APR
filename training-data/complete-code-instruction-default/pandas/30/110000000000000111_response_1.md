1. The buggy function is a method that attempts to parse a numpy ndarray into a date column. The issue on GitHub is related to using the `pd.read_json` function with `typ="series"`, which is resulting in timestamps or exceptions instead of a series of boolean values. The bug in the function is likely causing this unexpected behavior when trying to parse the data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for parsing the input ndarray into a date column. This logic seems to be causing the unexpected output when trying to convert boolean values to timestamps.

3. The bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempting to coerce boolean values into timestamps, which is not the expected behavior when the input data is a series of boolean values. This function is called internally when a series is created from a JSON list of boolean values using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series". There is an inconsistency in the behavior of this function when compared to the behavior of `pd.read_json` with `typ="frame"` and with `convert_dates` set to False.

4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to properly handle boolean data and ensure that it returns a series of boolean values when appropriate. This may involve adding specific conditions to check for boolean data and bypass the date parsing logic.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if new_data.dtype == 'bool':
        return new_data, True

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a check for boolean data, and if the input is a series of boolean values, it returns the boolean series without attempting to parse it into dates. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"`.
