The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is called within the `read_json` function when trying to parse a boolean series from JSON data. The error message indicates that the issue arises when trying to convert a boolean to a datetime object, which is not allowed.

The problematic code is likely within the `try` block that attempts to convert the data to an integer format. When the input data is a boolean, this conversion fails but does not raise an error, causing subsequent code to run and ultimately trying to convert the boolean to a datetime, which is not allowed.

To fix the bug, we should check for boolean types and handle them appropriately, possibly by returning early or converting them to a different data type before attempting to parse them as a datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle the boolean types:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        # Convert boolean values to integer (True -> 1, False -> 0)
        new_data = new_data.astype(int)

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if not issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.datetime64) and not issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, str):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle boolean values and return them as integers before attempting to parse them as datetimes, resolving the TypeError encountered in the failing test.
