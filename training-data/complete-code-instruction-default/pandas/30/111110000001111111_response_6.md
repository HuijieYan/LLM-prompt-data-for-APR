The bug in the provided function is that it is returning the original 'data' instead of the 'new_data' after conversion in the case when the data type is not 'object' and it does not pass the range check. Also, there is no handling of certain undefined variables such as 'isna', 'iNaT', and 'to_datetime'.

The issue posted on GitHub is related to parsing a JSON list of boolean values into a Pandas Series object, but in older versions of Pandas, it results in a Series of timestamps. Since version 1.0.0, it raises a TypeError because boolean values are not convertible to datetime.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional check of 'in_range.all()', and the incorrect return of 'data' instead of 'new_data' after conversion is made.

The cause of the bug involves the incorrect handling of non-epoch data types and non-handling of certain variables that are used.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the conversion of non-epoch data types, handle necessary variables, and ensure that the correct data is returned after the conversion. Additionally, it should handle the boolean data type specifically to avoid any issues when converting it to a date.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return new_data, False

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                np.isnan(new_data) 
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp) 
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return new_data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return new_data, False
```

This corrected code will handle the boolean data types separately, handle necessary variables such as 'isna', and ensure the correct data is returned after the conversion. It should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input and output variable information.
