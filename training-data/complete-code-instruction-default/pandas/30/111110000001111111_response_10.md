The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data to a date column, but it is encountering issues with the conversion. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that there are problems with parsing boolean values as dates.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the section where it checks for the dtype of the input data and attempts to convert it. It seems that the function is not properly handling boolean values and is attempting to parse them as dates, leading to the unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the function's inability to handle boolean values correctly, which leads to the unexpected conversion to dates.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle boolean values and not attempt to convert them to dates. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == 'bool':
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

The corrected function now properly handles boolean values, returning them as they are without attempting to convert them to dates. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
