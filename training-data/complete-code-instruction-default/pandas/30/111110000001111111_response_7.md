The issue seems to be that the function `_try_convert_to_date` is erroneously trying to convert non-datetime values (e.g., booleans, integers) to datetime values. This is causing unexpected behavior when trying to parse a Series of boolean values, as described in the GitHub issue.

The error location within the problematic function is in the section where it checks the data type and tries to convert it to 'int64'. This is incorrect, as boolean values should not be coerced to 'int64' for conversion to datetime.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of non-datetime values in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, leading to unexpected behavior and the TypeError described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we should update the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle non-datetime values correctly. Boolean values should remain as they are without trying to coerce them to 'int64'. Additionally, the function should return the original data along with a boolean flag indicating if the parsing was successful.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, iNaT
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64_any_dtype

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray-like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not is_datetime64_any_dtype(data):
            return data, False
        
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

This corrected function checks if the input data is already in datetime format. If it is, the function tries to convert it to datetime with the specified unit. If the input data is not in datetime format, it returns the original data with a parsing success flag. This updated function should resolve the issues described in the GitHub issue and correctly handle non-datetime values.
