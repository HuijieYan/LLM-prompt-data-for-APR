The bug is caused by the _try_convert_to_date function not correctly handling boolean values and coercing them to integer. This results in incorrect datetime values being returned when converting boolean values to dates. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _try_convert_to_date function to handle boolean values separately and not attempt to coerce them to integers. The function should return the input data with a boolean False flag if the input is of type bool, to indicate that parsing as date was unsuccessful.

Here's the corrected code for the _try_convert_to_date function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        # data is of boolean type, return it as is with False flag
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function should now handle boolean values correctly and return the input data as is with a False flag if the input data is of type bool. It will also handle other data types as before, attempting to coerce integers and dates, and returning True if parsing was successful.

This fix should address the issue outlined in the GitHub report and ensure that the function behaves as expected in the provided test cases.
