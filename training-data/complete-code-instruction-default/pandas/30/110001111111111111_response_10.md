While attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, the buggy function is incorrectly attempting to convert to datetime for both DateUnit and Boolean datatypes. This is evident from the error message "TypeError: <class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime" and the details given in the failing test.

In order to fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to check the data type of the input and handle boolean data separately, ensuring that boolean data is not converted to datetime.

Here is a possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data type of the input.
2. If the data type is boolean, return the input data with a boolean flag set to True.
3. If the data type is not boolean, proceed with the existing logic for conversion to datetime.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

class MyObjectParser:
    # ... existing implementation ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        # Check if data is boolean
        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False  # Return the input data with a boolean flag set to False

        # Existing logic for datetime conversion
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

The corrected function first checks if the input data is of boolean type. If it is, it returns the input data with a boolean flag set to False. If the input data is not boolean, it proceeds with the existing logic for datetime conversion.

With this modification, the function will correctly differentiate between boolean and datetime data, ensuring that boolean data is not incorrectly converted to datetime. This will address the issue reported in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
