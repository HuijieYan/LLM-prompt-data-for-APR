The issue is related to the `_try_convert_to_date` function which is a method of the `Parser` class. The function is used to try to parse a numpy array into a date column, but it is failing to handle boolean values correctly. The GitHub issue details how the `pd.read_json` method with `typ="series"` is resulting in timestamps or exceptions, rather than a series of boolean values as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where it tries to convert the data to datetime without handling boolean values properly.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling boolean values correctly and is attempting to convert them to datetime, resulting in the wrong output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include adding a check for boolean data types before attempting to convert them to datetime, and returning the original data unchanged if it is boolean.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    # this is the fixed function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == bool:  # Check for boolean data type
            return data, False  # Return the original data and False
    
        # Handle non-empty data
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                pd.isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == pd.NaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected function adds a check for boolean data types, and if the data is boolean, it returns the original data and False, indicating that parsing was not successful. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
