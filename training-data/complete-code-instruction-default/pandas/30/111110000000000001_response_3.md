1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class, which appears to be designed to convert data into date format. The function seems to be checking the data type of the input data, attempting to convert it to integer if it's an object, and then checking if it's within a certain range. It then tries to convert the data to a datetime object using different time units. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the handling of the `new_data` variable and the loop that tries different date units for conversion.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to the mishandling of the `new_data` variable and the loop that tries different date units for conversion. It seems that the function does not properly handle the conversion of data to date format and does not handle errors consistently.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensure that the type conversion of `new_data` is handled correctly
   - Improve error handling and consistency when converting the data to date format
   - Verify the data type and handle the type conversion properly for different data types

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return new_data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        return data, False
```
In the corrected code, I have amended the error handling and refactor the date unit conversion loop to ensure that the `new_data` variable is handled consistently and the errors are properly managed.
