The issue arises from the `_try_convert_to_date` function, which is incorrectly parsing boolean values as datetimes. This is causing the failing test to raise a TypeError when trying to parse a boolean value to a datetime.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to correctly handle boolean data and avoid attempting to parse it as a datetime. Additionally, for Case 1, the logic for parsing datetime needs to be revised to handle RangeIndex data correctly.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to add a check in the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean data separately and avoid the attempt to parse it as a datetime. Additionally, the datetime parsing logic needs to be adjusted to handle RangeIndex data.

Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        except AttributeError:  # handle RangeIndex
            new_data = data.values.astype("int64")

    if isinstance(new_data, np.ndarray) and np.issubdtype(new_data.dtype, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if isinstance(new_data, (pd.Series, pd.RangeIndex)):
        new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors="coerce")

    return new_data, True
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved.
