Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/io/json/_json.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

class Parser():

    # this is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
          
        if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
            return data, False

        new_data = data

        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")  # Change "data" to "new_data"
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):  # Change "new_data.dtype" to "new_data.dtype.type"
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)  # Remove "_values" from "new_data._values"
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)  # Change "new_data" to "data"
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

The potential error locations were identified based on the fact that the original code referenced `data` in some places and `new_data` in others, creating inconsistency and potential errors. Additionally, there were some incorrect references to the numpy `dtype` and the `isna` function that needed to be fixed.

The bug was caused by an inconsistency in variable naming, using `new_data` in some places and `data` in others, as well as incorrect references to the numpy `dtype` and the `isna` function.

The bug was fixed by ensuring consistent variable naming, using correct references to the numpy `dtype` and the `isna` function, and making minor adjustments to the code logic.

The corrected code resolves these issues and ensures that the function works as intended.
