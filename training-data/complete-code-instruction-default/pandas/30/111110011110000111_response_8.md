1. The buggy function is a method called _try_convert_to_date within the Parser class. This function is called when trying to convert data to a date format, but it currently has some issues handling boolean values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where it is trying to coerce boolean values into a date format using the to_datetime function.

3. The cause of the bug is that the _try_convert_to_date function is not handling boolean values correctly and is trying to coerce them into a date format, resulting in a TypeError. The failing test is trying to read a JSON list of boolean values and convert them into a pandas Series, but due to the bug, it is resulting in a TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the data type of the input and handling boolean values separately before attempting to convert to a date format.
   - Adding a conditional check to skip the conversion if the input is of boolean type.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser:
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":  # Handling boolean values
            return data, False

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                pd.isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == pd.iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function checks for boolean values and returns False without attempting to convert them to a date format. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and also pass the failing test.
