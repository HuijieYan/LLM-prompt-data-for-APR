1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is trying to parse a ndarray-like into a date column. It checks if the data is empty, then tries to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. It also checks for numbers that are out of range and ignores them. It then tries to convert the data to datetime, and if that fails, it continues trying different date units. The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is trying to convert a boolean series from JSON, and it fails with a TypeError stating that the boolean class is not convertible to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it tries to convert data to datetime and in the subsequent checks for different date units.

3. The bug is caused by the function `_try_convert_to_date` trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not supported. The failing test is attempting to convert boolean values from JSON, and the error message indicates that the boolean class is not convertible to datetime.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Exclude boolean values from the conversion to datetime.
   b. Add a condition to check for boolean values and handle them separately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    # Exclude boolean values
    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected code, a new condition has been added to exclude boolean values from the conversion to datetime, which should fix the bug without affecting other data types.
