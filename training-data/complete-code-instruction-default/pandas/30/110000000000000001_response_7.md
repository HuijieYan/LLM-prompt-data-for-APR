1. Analysis:
This function is designed to try to parse a ndarray into a date column by coercing objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats.

2. Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the part where it checks for numbers that are out of range.

3. Bug's cause:

The bug's cause is the possibility of numbers being out of range not being handled correctly, resulting in incorrect parsing of the data or potentially causing errors.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
a. Handle the out of range numbers properly and return the correct result
b. Add necessary error handling to ensure that the function behaves as expected in all cases

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data) | (new_data <= self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if in_range.all():
            date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else to_datetime._STAMP_UNITS
            for date_unit in date_units:
                try:
                    new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    continue
                return new_data, True

    return data, False
```
In the corrected code:
- Handle the out-of-range numbers properly and return the correct result by checking for numbers within the range and using the correct logical operators.
- Use the correct method for accessing the stamp units and handle the date parsing within the if block that checks for in-range numbers.
- Return the correct result based on parsing success or failure.
