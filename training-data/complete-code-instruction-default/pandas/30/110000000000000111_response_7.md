1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue because it is responsible for parsing a ndarray into a date column, which is causing the incorrect output when using `typ="series"` in the `pd.read_json` function. The issue on GitHub describes how the expected output is a Pandas series of bools, but instead, it is returning a series of timestamps or raising a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for parsing the ndarray into a date column, as it is currently returning a date column instead of a series of bools.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is attempting to convert the input data into a date format, but it is not correctly handling boolean values. As a result, the function is returning a date column instead of a series of bools when `typ="series"` in the `pd.read_json` function is used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a check to handle boolean values separately and return a series of bools without attempting to convert them to date formats.
   - Modify the function to handle different data types correctly, ensuring that it returns the expected output based on the `typ` parameter in the `pd.read_json` function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # handle boolean values separately
    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            np.isnan(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to handle boolean values separately and return them as a series of bools without attempting to convert them to date formats. This change should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
