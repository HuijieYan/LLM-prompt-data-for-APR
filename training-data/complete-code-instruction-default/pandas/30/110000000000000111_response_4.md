1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is linked to the GitHub issue by being part of the pandas library, specifically in the `read_json` method. The issue involves the `read_json` method returning a Series of timestamps instead of a Series of bools when `typ="series"` is used with a JSON list of bools.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that attempts to convert the input data to datetime.

3. The bug's cause is that the function `_try_convert_to_date` is incorrectly parsing the input data and returning a Series of timestamps instead of a Series of bools as expected in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Avoiding date conversion for boolean type input data
   - Adding a condition to check the data type and return the input data as is if it is boolean

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected function, the issue described in the GitHub post should be resolved, and the `read_json` method should return a Series of bools as expected.
