The issue with the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that it is trying to convert boolean values to datetime. This results in a TypeError when trying to convert a boolean value to datetime.

To fix this issue, the function should first check if the data is of boolean type, and if so, it should return the data as is along with a False flag indicating that the parsing was not successful.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # if the data type is boolean, return data as is
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this change, the function will correctly handle boolean values and return them as is, along with the False flag, indicating that the parsing was not successful for boolean values. This should fix the TypeError that was occurring when trying to convert boolean values to datetime.
