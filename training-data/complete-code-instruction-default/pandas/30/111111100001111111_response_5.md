The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` in the `Parser` class is responsible for trying to parse an ndarray into a date column. The function attempts to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats and return a boolean if parsing was successful.

The function first checks if the input data is empty and if so, returns the data and False. After this, it attempts to convert the data to integers if the dtype is "object". It then checks if the data is in range and converts it to datetime using the specified date unit. If any errors are encountered during this process, it continues to the next date unit and eventually returns the original data and False if no successful conversions are made.

Based on the information provided, the issue seems to be related to converting boolean data to datetime instead of retaining the original boolean values. The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, along with expected and actual output, version information, and the specific scenario that leads to the problem.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it attempts to coerce object types to int64. In the second test case, the input data is a Series with boolean values. However, the function tries to coerce the data to int64, which is unnecessary and leads to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle boolean values differently and ensure that the original boolean values are retained when appropriate.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected code handles boolean values differently and prevents unnecessary coercion of boolean data to int64. It also retains the original boolean data type when appropriate.

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases.
