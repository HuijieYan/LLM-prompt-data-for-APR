1. Analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the function _try_convert_to_date is attempting to parse a series of data into a date column. The issue described on GitHub relates to the fact that when using pd.read_json with typ="series", it should result in a Pandas Series of bools, but instead, it returns timestamps or raises an exception.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the section where it checks for the dtype of the data and attempts to coerce it into "int64". This conversion might be causing the issue when dealing with boolean values.

3. The bug's cause can be identified through the following elements:
   (a). The buggy function attempts to coerce object types into "int64" and then checks for the date units.
   (b). The buggy class is the Parser class, within which the _try_convert_to_date function is defined. It also contains other related functions for parsing JSON data.
   (c). The related functions might include those that handle the conversion of different data types within the Parser class.
   (d). The GitHub issue information provides a clear example of the problem and the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve:
   (a). Modifying the data coercion process to handle boolean values differently.
   (b). Ensuring that the function correctly identifies and processes boolean values.
   (c). Handling boolean values as a separate case to avoid coercion into "int64" which is causing the issue.
   (d). Updating the function to return the expected output for a Pandas Series of bools when using pd.read_json with typ="series".

5. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import iNaT
from pandas import isna, to_datetime

class Parser():

    # this is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == bool:  # Handling boolean values
            return new_data, True
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected function now includes a specific handling for boolean values, ensuring that they are returned and processed as a separate case. This modification should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and provide the expected output for a Pandas Series of bools.
