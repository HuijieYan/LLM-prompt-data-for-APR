The bug in the code is that in the first case, the "new_data" object is not being updated correctly due to incorrect logic. The "new_data" variable is being updated inside the if statement, but then the updated "new_data" variable is not being used for further operations.

To fix this bug, the logic of updating the "new_data" variable needs to be corrected so that the correct and updated "new_data" is used for further operations. Additionally, the "in_range" array is not being generated correctly due to incorrect logic.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the "new_data" variable based on the conditions and then use the correct and updated "new_data" variable for generating the "in_range" array.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return new_data, False
```
