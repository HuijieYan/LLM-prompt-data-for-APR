1. The buggy function _try_convert_to_date is causing an issue when trying to coerce a pandas Series object with boolean values into datetime objects. This is related to the GitHub issue because the expected output should be a Series of bools, but instead, it results in a Series of timestamps or raises an exception.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the try_convert_to_date method where it tries to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. This coercion is causing the issue when dealing with boolean values.

3. The bug's cause is that the _try_convert_to_date function is not handling the coercion of boolean values correctly. The GitHub issue also confirms that the expected output should be a Series of bools, but it is inconsistent with the actual behavior of the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the dtype of the input data and handle boolean values separately from other types.
   - Update the function to explicitly check for boolean values and handle them appropriately.
   - Avoid unnecessary coercion when the input data is already in the desired format.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import iNaT
from pandas import isna, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, True

    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code checks for boolean values and returns them immediately, ensuring that the function handles them correctly and outputs a Series of bools as expected.
