The buggy function is part of the "Parser" class. It appears to be an attempt to convert a given data into a date format, handling various data types and formats.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the data conversion and parsing process, which includes handling different data types and formats.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the inappropriate handling of different data types and formats during the conversion and parsing process. This can result in the function not correctly identifying and converting data into a date format.

The possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve:
- Double-checking the data conversion and parsing logic
- Ensuring that the function handles different data types and formats appropriately
- Adding error handling to address potential issues during the conversion and parsing process

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the potential issues related to data conversion and parsing have been addressed. The `astype` method uses the correct variable `new_data` for conversion, and proper error handling is implemented during the conversion and parsing process.
