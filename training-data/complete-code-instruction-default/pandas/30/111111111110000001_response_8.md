1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class defined in the `_json.py` file of the `pandas` library. The function attempts to parse an ndarray into a date column and coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely the `if new_data.dtype == "object":` condition and the subsequent `try` block where it tries to convert data to `int64`. The error message indicates that a boolean class cannot be converted to a datetime.

3. The bug is likely caused by the function attempting to convert a boolean value to a datetime, which is not a valid operation. The failing test is trying to read an array of booleans from JSON and convert it to a Series using `read_json` function, which ultimately calls the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

4. Possible approaches to fixing the bug include:
   a. Checking the type of input data and ensuring that only valid date formats are being converted to datetime.
   b. Adding conditionals to handle specific data types or coercing the data to a valid date format before attempting to convert to datetime.
   c. Making sure that the input data passed to the function is properly formatted for conversion to a date.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray-like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="ignore")
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

        date_conds = [
            new_data.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]', 
            new_data.dtype == 'datetime64[ns, UTC]'
        ]
        if any(date_conds):
            return new_data, True
        else:
            return data, False
```

In this corrected version of the function, we use the `pd.to_datetime` function to convert the `new_data` to datetime. If the data can be successfully converted to datetime, we return `new_data` and `True`. Otherwise, we return the original `data` and `False`. This change ensures that only valid date or datetime types are returned from the function.
