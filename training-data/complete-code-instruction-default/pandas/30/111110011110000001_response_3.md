The problematic function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class. It seems to have been developed as part of a JSON parser in the pandas library. The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is trying to read a JSON input containing boolean values into a pandas Series. However, when the JSON input is parsed, it results in a boolean value that is not convertible to a datetime object, which causes a TypeError.

The issue seems to be arising from the function `to_datetime` within the `_try_convert_to_date` method, which is trying to convert the input data into a datetime object. However, when it encounters boolean values, it raises a TypeError as boolean values cannot be converted to datetime objects.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the scenario where the input data is of boolean type and bypass the datetime conversion process for such data. We can filter out boolean values before attempting to convert to datetime.

Here is the fixed version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function within the `Parser` class:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_bool_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCExtensionArray

class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if is_bool_dtype(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                pd.isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == pd.NaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the fixed version, we added a check to see if the input data is of boolean type using `is_bool_dtype` and return the original input data along with `False` if it is a boolean. We also changed `isna` and `iNaT` to `pd.isna` and `pd.NaT` respectively to ensure compatibility. This modified function should now handle the input data with boolean values and not attempt to convert them to datetime, which resolves the TypeError that was previously occurring.
