The bug in the given function appears to be in the section where it attempts to ignore numbers that are out of range. The variable `new_data` is being incorrectly overwritten with a RangeIndex object even if it is found to be out of range. This is likely causing the function to return incorrect output.

To fix this issue, we need to update the logic to create a copy of the `data` instead of directly assigning it to `new_data`. This will ensure that the original input is preserved and any changes are made to a separate variable.

Additionally, it appears that the date parsing logic could be updated to ensure that it catches all error cases appropriately and doesn't return invalid output.

A possible approach for fixing this bug is to make the following changes:

1. Create a copy of the `data` and perform the necessary operations on the copy to avoid modifying the original input data.
2. Modify the logic for checking numbers that are out of range.
3. Update the date parsing logic to handle error cases more effectively.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()  # Create a copy of the data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the input values and produce the expected output in both the described test cases.
