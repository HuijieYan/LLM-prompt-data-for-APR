1. The buggy function "_try_convert_to_date" is trying to parse a series of data into a date column. It is attempting to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. The function checks for the data type of the input and tries to convert it to "int64" if it is of type "object". It then checks for values that are out of range for numbers and disregards them. Finally, it attempts to parse the data into datetime, with different date units.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is the logic for handling out-of-range numbers, as well as the processing of different date units.

3. The bug's cause seems to be the function not correctly handling the out-of-range numbers in the data, as well as the handling of different date units. The input/output variable information does not match the expected results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adjusting the logic for handling out-of-range numbers and ensuring that the function correctly processes different date units.


5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    
    # Corrected version of the _try_convert_to_date function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a Series like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if len(data) == 0:
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            self.min_stamp = 0  # Assuming that self.min_stamp is an attribute of the class
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = ('s', 'ms', 'us', 'ns')
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```
In the corrected version:
- The comparison for an empty data has been fixed to check for the length of the data.
- The logic for handling out-of-range numbers has been updated to include the necessary comparisons and adjustments.
- The iteration through different date units has been fixed to return the new_data and True if parsing is successful.
- The date_units variable has been defined as a tuple directly within the function.
