Based on the information provided, it appears that the bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which raises a TypeError. This is inconsistent with the expectations of the users, as they expect a Series of bools when using `typ="series"` with `read_json`.

To fix this bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be modified to handle the case when the data is of boolean type. In this case, it should return the original data as is, and the success flag as True. This will ensure that the values are not converted to datetime and that the test case will pass as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # If the data is of boolean type, return the original data and set success flag to True
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, True

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this fix, the test case for `read_json` with `typ="series"` should pass successfully, and it should no longer raise a TypeError when encountering boolean values. This should also address the issue reported in the GitHub post, ensuring that a Series of bools is returned as expected.
