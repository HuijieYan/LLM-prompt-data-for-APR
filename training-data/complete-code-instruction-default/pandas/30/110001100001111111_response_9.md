The bug appears to be caused by the function incorrectly converting boolean values to timestamps instead of returning a series of boolean values. This is a problem because users expect the function to return a series of bools and not raise an exception. Additionally, the behavior is inconsistent with the "frame" case and contradicts the expected output.

To fix this bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be modified to correctly handle boolean values and return a series of boolean values instead of timestamps. This can be achieved by explicitly checking for boolean data types and handling them appropriately, rather than attempting to coerce them into timestamp formats.

Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a data object into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, True

    try:
        new_data = data.astype("int64")
    except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
        new_data = data

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return data, False
```

This corrected code checks for boolean data types and returns the data as-is with a successful flag if the input data is of boolean type. Additionally, it attempts to convert the data into a timestamp only if it is not of boolean type and handles the conversion appropriately.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the function returns the expected outputs for both boolean and non-boolean input data.
