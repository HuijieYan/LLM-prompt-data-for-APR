1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is trying to convert a boolean value to a datetime object, which is not possible. This function is called during the process of reading and parsing JSON data, and it's failing with a TypeError message related to the inability to convert a boolean value to a datetime. The failing test is trying to parse a JSON array containing boolean values into a Pandas series, and the function is unable to handle this conversion.

2. The potential error location within the function is where it calls `to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)` to convert the data to datetime. Since `new_data` can contain boolean values, this is where the error arises.

3. 
   (a). The function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the Parser class, which is used for parsing JSON data within the pandas library.
   (b). The related functions include the code that handles JSON parsing and datetime conversion. The failing test is trying to parse a JSON array of boolean values into a pandas series.
   (c). The failing test provided shows that the code is calling `read_json` with a JSON string containing boolean values. This triggers the conversion process in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, resulting in a TypeError related to the conversion of boolean to datetime.
   (d). The error message indicates that the type `bool` is not convertible to a datetime, which aligns with the analysis of the function.

4. To fix the bug, the function `_try_convert_to_date` should be modified to handle boolean values in a way that it doesn't attempt to convert them to datetime.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        # Handle boolean data separately
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected code, a check for boolean data has been added, and if the `new_data` is of type 'bool', it immediately returns `data, False` without attempting to convert it to datetime. This avoids the TypeError related to converting boolean to datetime, and the function should now pass the failing test.
