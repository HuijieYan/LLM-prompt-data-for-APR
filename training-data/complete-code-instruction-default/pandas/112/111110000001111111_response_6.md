Based on the provided information, the bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the comparison of `IntervalIndex` objects. The `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):` condition is not handling the comparison correctly, leading to the failure of the `round` method as described in the GitHub issue.

The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect comparison and handling of `IntervalIndex` objects within the `get_indexer` function, which results in an invalid return value.

To fix the bug, the `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):` block should be revised to handle the comparison and indexing of `IntervalIndex` objects correctly, ensuring that the `round` method works as expected when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
Raises
------
NotImplementedError
    If any method argument other than the default of
    None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
"""
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
    else:
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self._ensure_type())

    return indexer
```

In the corrected code, we handle the comparison of `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` objects appropriately to ensure that the `round` method works as expected.

With this fix, the `round` method should now work as normal for columns that are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
