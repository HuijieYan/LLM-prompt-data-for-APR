The bug is caused by the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates that there is no matching signature found for the `get_indexer` method when the columns are of type CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This is causing the `round` method to fail when these types of columns are used.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class to handle the case when the columns are of type CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):   # Check for CategoricalIndex
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code as is
        # ...
    else:
        # remaining code as is
        # ...
```

This modification ensures that when the `target` is of type CategoricalIndex, it gets converted to its categories before further processing. This should resolve the TypeError when calling the `round` method with CategoricalIndex columns of IntervalIndex type.

This fix should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
