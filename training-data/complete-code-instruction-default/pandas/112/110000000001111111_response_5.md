The problem is likely in the `get_indexer` function, specifically in the condition that checks if `target_as_index` is of type `IntervalIndex`. It seems that the function is not able to handle `target_as_index` when it is of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This leads to the `round` method failing when columns are `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.

The expected behavior is for the `round` method to work as normal even when the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `get_indexer` function to handle `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` properly.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add a specific condition to handle `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This could involve converting the `CategoricalIndex` back to an `IntervalIndex` before processing it in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        # Convert it back to IntervalIndex
        target_as_index = pd.IntervalIndex(target_as_index.categories)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code for handling IntervalIndex
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # remaining code for handling non-IntervalIndex types
    else:
        # remaining code for handling other cases

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

The above corrected code includes a specific condition to handle `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. It involves converting the `CategoricalIndex` back to an `IntervalIndex` before processing it in the function. This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and also take into account the expected input/output variable information provided.
