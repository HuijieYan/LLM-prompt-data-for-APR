The buggy function `get_indexer` is causing the round method to fail when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The function attempts to handle situations where the index is an IntervalIndex and would round normal numeric values, however it fails to handle the case where the index is a CategoricalIndex based on an IntervalIndex.

The bug's cause appears to be an issue with handling CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex within the `get_indexer` function. There is a lack of proper handling for this specific scenario, leading to a TypeError when attempting to round the values in the DataFrame.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Adding a condition to check if the index is a CategoricalIndex based on an IntervalIndex, and handle the rounding of values accordingly.
2. Implementing a separate logic for CategoricalIndex based on an IntervalIndex within the `get_indexer` function to ensure proper rounding of values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected code for the problematic function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    # Check if the index is a CategoricalIndex based on an IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(self, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(self.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        # Handle rounding for CategoricalIndex based on an IntervalIndex
        rounded_data = np.round(self._codes)
        return rounded_data
    else:
        # Original implementation for handling other index types
        self._check_method(method)
        # ... (rest of the function logic remains the same) ...
```

This corrected code introduces a condition to check if the index is a CategoricalIndex based on an IntervalIndex. If it is, the rounding is handled differently using the `_codes` attribute. Otherwise, the original logic for handling other index types is preserved. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug while ensuring the correct rounding behavior for different index types.
