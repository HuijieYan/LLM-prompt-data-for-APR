The buggy function `get_indexer` is encountering a TypeError: No matching signature found when trying to run `df.round()`. This likely indicates an issue with the type or format of the `target` parameter that is being passed to `get_indexer`.

The function `get_indexer` appears to be used for selecting and reordering elements along a particular axis, based on the elements present in the `target` parameter. However, it seems that the `_engine` attribute may not be handling the `target` parameter correctly, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `target` parameter is being handled correctly by the `_engine.get_indexer` method. This likely involves confirming that the `target_as_index.values` attribute is of the correct type and format.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):

        # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(target_as_index)
```

In this corrected function, we directly return `target_as_index` as an array after processing it. This should resolve the issue by ensuring the correct type and format of the return value, which was causing the TypeError in the failing test.
