The issue seems to stem from the `get_indexer` method of `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex`. When the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, the `round` method fails to find a matching signature, resulting in a TypeError. This can be seen from the GitHub issue description where `df.round()` works for `df` with IntervalIndex columns, but fails for `df2` with CategoricalIndex columns.

The buggy function in question is trying to handle different cases based on the type of the target index and the self index. It checks if the self index and target index are equal, the closed type is different, and if the target index is an object dtype. However, the code seems to have some issues with handling IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex objects correctly, especially when it comes to the `get_indexer` method.

The discrepancies in the input/output variable information indicate that the buggy function is not correctly handling the IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex cases, leading to the failure of the `round` method when using CategoricalIndex columns.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code in the `get_indexer` method to properly handle the cases where the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to implement specific logic for handling CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex in the `get_indexer` method. This would involve properly converting CategoricalIndex to IntervalIndex and then handling the indexing logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(self, IntervalIndex) and isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex):
        target = target.categories.codes  # Convert CategoricalIndex to codes

    # Rest of the original code here...
```

By specifically handling the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex, and converting it to codes, we can ensure that the `get_indexer` method works correctly for both IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex cases. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the `round` method to work as expected.
