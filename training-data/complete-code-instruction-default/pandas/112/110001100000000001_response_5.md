The potential error in the buggy function `get_indexer` seems to be in the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` and the subsequent block of code. The function `is_overlapping` appears to be a method that should be called, but instead, the buggy code is referencing it as an attribute without calling it as a method. This could lead to incorrect logic and is likely the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `is_overlapping` is called as a method to check if the intervals are overlapping.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    # Fix: Call the is_overlapping method
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ... (the remaining code is the same as the original function)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we have added parentheses to `self.is_overlapping` to call it as a method, which should resolve the bug by properly checking for overlapping indices.
