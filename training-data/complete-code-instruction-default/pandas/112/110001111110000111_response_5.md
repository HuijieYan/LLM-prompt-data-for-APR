The buggy function in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file is the `get_indexer` function. The error is being raised when trying to call `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` due to a TypeError with no matching signature found.

The cause of the bug seems to be an issue with calling the `_engine.get_indexer` method, possibly due to incorrect arguments being passed or incorrectly defined signature for the method.

To fix the issue, the `_engine.get_indexer` method needs to be revisited to ensure that the correct arguments are being passed and that the method's signature is correctly defined.

The corrected code for the `get_indexer` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise NotImplementedError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the call to `self.is_overlapping` has been modified to `self.is_overlapping()`, which is a method call. The `is_overlapping` method should be called instead of just checking its existence. This fix should address the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
