The bug is likely located in the get_indexer function of the IntervalIndex class. The error message indicates a TypeError with no matching signature found. This suggests that the function is being called with the wrong parameter types or number of parameters.

The buggy function is trying to compute the indexer by calling self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values). However, the self._engine variable appears undefined, and there's no information provided about its type or value at runtime.

A possible fix for this bug would be to properly define and initialize the self._engine variable within the IntervalIndex class. This variable should be an instance of an appropriate class or object that has a get_indexer method that accepts the necessary parameters as specified in the failing test.

```python
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # other initialization code
        self._engine = IntervalTree()  # initialize _engine with an appropriate instance

    # ... other methods

    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            # error handling code
        else:
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
            if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
                # code to handle IntervalIndex
            elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
                if self._engine is not None:
                    indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
                    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
                else:
                    raise NotImplementedError("No matching signature found")
            else:
                # code to handle other cases
```

Please ensure to replace the ellipses (...) in the __init__ method with the appropriate parameters and their corresponding initialization. Also, replace the comments "# code to handle IntervalIndex" and "# code to handle other cases" with the actual code to handle those cases.

By properly initializing the self._engine variable of the IntervalIndex class and ensuring that it has a get_indexer method that accepts the necessary parameters, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass.
