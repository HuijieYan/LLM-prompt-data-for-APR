From the failing test, it can be inferred that the bug is likely related to the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with no matching signature found.

The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is failing to handle the input appropriately, leading to a `TypeError`. The function seems to be expecting a `scalar_t[:]` input for `target`, which is causing the issue.

It is likely that the function is not handling the input `target` correctly, or there may be a mismatch in the signatures of the function with the actual input provided.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class should be updated to handle the input `target` correctly and ensure that the function signature matches the expected input. 

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By modifying the function to correctly handle the `target` input and ensuring that the function signature matches the expected input, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass.
