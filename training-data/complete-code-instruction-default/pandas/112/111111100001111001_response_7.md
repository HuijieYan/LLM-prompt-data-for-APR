The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if self.is_overlapping:`. The bug's cause is that `self.is_overlapping` is a method, not a property, so it needs to be called as `self.is_overlapping()`.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to call the `is_overlapping` method to obtain its value and modify the subsequent logic based on the result.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the logic remains the same
```
With this fix, the `is_overlapping` method is correctly called and the subsequent logic in the function will behave as expected.
