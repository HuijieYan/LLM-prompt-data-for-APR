1. Analyzing the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test is trying to round the DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which leads to a TypeError with no matching signature found.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `get_indexer` method where the error is occurring.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is not handling the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
   (b). The related functions such as `_check_method`, `is_overlapping`, `ensure_index`, `_maybe_convert_i8`, and others seem to be working correctly, but the issue lies specific to the handling of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex in the `get_indexer` method.
   (c). The failing test is trying to round a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, leading to a TypeError with no matching signature found.
   (d). The GitHub issue describes that the round method fails whenever the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. It is expected that the round method should work normally in this scenario.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   (a). Update the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class to properly handle the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
   (b). Ensure that the `get_indexer` method can handle the rounding operation for the given input.

5. Corrected Code for the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
# Fixed and corrected version of the get_indexer method in the IntervalIndex class
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype='int')

        for i, key in enumerate(target_as_index):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
                indexer[i] = loc
            except KeyError:
                indexer[i] = -1

    return indexer
```

With the corrected `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class, the rounding operation on a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex should work as expected, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub.
