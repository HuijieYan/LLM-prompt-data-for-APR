The potential error in the problematic function seems to be in the conditional check for `self.is_overlapping`. It is expected that the bug is causing the function to raise an `InvalidIndexError` due to an incorrect evaluation of `self.is_overlapping`. This is likely due to a missing method call to `is_overlapping()` rather than simply accessing the attribute `is_overlapping`.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional check for `self.is_overlapping` to call the method `is_overlapping()` and then perform the condition check inside the `get_indexer` function.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the `get_indexer` function will correctly call the `is_overlapping()` method of the `IntervalIndex` class and perform the condition check based on its result, fixing the bug.
