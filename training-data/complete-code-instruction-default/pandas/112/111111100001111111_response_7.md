The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the conditional statements that check the type of the target index and the subsequent indexing and comparison operations.

The bug's cause is likely related to the handling of the IntervalIndex when creating a DataFrame with CategoricalIndex. The `ensure_index` function may not handle IntervalIndex converted to CategoricalIndex properly, leading to a situation where the `round` method fails when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to ensure proper handling of IntervalIndex when creating a DataFrame with CategoricalIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that should resolve the issue:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if hasattr(self, "is_overlapping") and self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        indexer = target.get_indexer(self)
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected code includes additional handling for the case where the target index is a CategoricalIndex with categories represented as an IntervalIndex. It uses the `get_indexer` method of the CategoricalIndex to obtain the indexer in this case.

With this corrected code, the `round` method should work as expected even when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
