The potential error in the buggy function is with the conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping:`. The condition should be `if self.is_overlapping():` as `is_overlapping` is a function and needs to be called with parentheses.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the `is_overlapping` function using parentheses to determine if the index is overlapping.
2. Use proper indexing and comparison methods to correctly handle overlapping and non-overlapping indices.

Corrected code:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)

        )

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same
