Analysis:
The buggy function is a method within the IntervalIndex class. It is called get_indexer and is responsible for returning an indexer for the specified target based on the properties of the IntervalIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional statement:
if self.is_overlapping:

The bug's cause is that the condition if self.is_overlapping: is always evaluating to True, leading to an InvalidIndexError being raised. This is likely due to a logic error or incorrect usage of the is_overlapping property.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking the correct usage and implementation of the is_overlapping property.
2. Verifying the logic for determining if the index is overlapping.
3. Ensuring that the correct conditions are being checked before raising an InvalidIndexError.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of

            },
