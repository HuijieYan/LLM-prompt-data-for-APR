Based on the analysis of the provided information, it appears that the bug in the function is related to the signature of the get_indexer method. The failing test indicates a TypeError with no matching signature found, which suggests that the function signature is not compatible with the input provided.

The bug is likely caused by the mismatch between the input type (CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex) and the signature of the get_indexer method within the IntervalIndex class.

Considering the information from the failing test, expected input/output variables, the provided class and function, and the GitHub issue, it can be concluded that the bug is likely related to the handling of the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex within the get_indexer method.

To resolve the bug, the get_indexer method should be updated to handle the CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex input appropriately. The method signature and the logic for handling the input should be revised to ensure compatibility with the input type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Add handling for CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
```

By updating the get_indexer method to handle the CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex input appropriately, the bug should now be resolved. This fix should address the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
