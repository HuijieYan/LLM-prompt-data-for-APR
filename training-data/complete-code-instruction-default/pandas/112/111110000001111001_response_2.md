The buggy function in question is a method `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. This method is meant to determine the position of elements within the index. However, after analyzing the provided input and output variable information, it seems that the method is failing to handle cases where the indexes may overlap.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping`. While this conditional is present, it does not seem to be effectively handling overlapping indices, as indicated by the test cases.

The cause of the bug could be due to the inadequate handling of overlapping indices within the `get_indexer` method. This could lead to incorrect results or errors when the index does contain overlapping intervals.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to effectively handle overlapping indices. This can be achieved by implementing a logic that addresses the specific behavior of the method when overlapping intervals are encountered.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method that satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------

        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        
        self._check_method(method)
        
        if method is not None:
            raise NotImplementedError("Specifying a method other than the default is not yet implemented.")
        
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
            
            common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
            
            indexer = []
            for i in range(len(target_as_index)):
                loc = self.get_loc(target_as_index.left[i], 'left')
                if loc != -1:
                    indexer.append(loc)
                else:
                    loc = self.get_loc(target_as_index.right[i], 'right')
                    indexer.append(loc)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we have added a conditional check for the `method` parameter and raised `NotImplementedError` if a method other than the default is specified. Additionally, for cases where the target index is an `IntervalIndex`, we have implemented a logic to handle overlapping intervals by iterating through the target index and obtaining the location for each interval's left and right values using the `get_loc` method with the appropriate method argument ('left' or 'right').

By implementing this revised logic, the `get_indexer` method should now effectively handle overlapping indices and provide the expected output based on the input parameters provided.
