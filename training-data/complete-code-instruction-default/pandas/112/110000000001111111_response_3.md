The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex. The issue mentioned in the GitHub report is consistent with this observation, where the `round` method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex. This suggests that the bug might be related to the handling of columns with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Based on the expected and actual input/output variable information, it seems that the bug might be related to how the function is handling the `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` types, leading to a `TypeError` when the `round` method is called on a dataframe containing columns with `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be when handling the `target_as_index` variable. The function might not be handling the `CategoricalIndex` type correctly, leading to the `round` method failing on dataframes containing such columns.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the `CategoricalIndex` type, specifically when it is created from an `IntervalIndex`. This might involve making adjustments to how the function handles the `target_as_index` variable and how it interacts with the `CategoricalIndex` type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `CategoricalIndex` and extracting the categories from the `CategoricalIndex` if it is encountered. This modification should ensure that the function correctly handles the `CategoricalIndex` type, especially when created from an `IntervalIndex`. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and allow the `round` method to work as expected on dataframes containing such columns.
