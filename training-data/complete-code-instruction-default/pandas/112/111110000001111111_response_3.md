The issue seems to be caused by the fact that the `round` method is failing when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The source of the issue is likely within the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class, as it is responsible for determining the indexers for the dataframe, which could be affecting the `round` method.

The expected behavior of the `round` method is to work as normal, regardless of the type of index used for the columns. However, when using a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, it fails with a TypeError.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` function correctly handles `CategoricalIndex` and `IntervalIndex` cases. Additionally, any comparison operations within the `get_indexer` function should account for the possibility of using a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target._codes, pd.IntervalIndex):
            target_as_index = target._codes
        else:
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
            
        # Rest of the function remains the same as before
        # ...
```

This correction ensures that if the `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` with underlying `IntervalIndex`, it extracts the `IntervalIndex` from the `_codes` attribute. This should resolve the issue encountered with the `round` method failing when using a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.
