The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` function of the pandas library when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The failing test is an example of this scenario, and the error message indicates a `TypeError` with no matching signature found.

The bug is likely located in the section of the function where it is attempting to get the indexer using the `_engine.get_indexer` method. This is evident from the error message, which specifically points to this line of code.

The failing test uses a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` as the columns of a DataFrame. The `df.round()` method subsequently fails due to an incompatible signature when passing the `IntervalIndex` to the `get_indexer` function.

The GitHub issue further describes the problem, stating that the `round` method fails whenever the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The expected output is for the `round` method to work as normal in this scenario.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function needs to be modified to handle the case where the `CategoricalIndex` is created from an `IntervalIndex` as columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        # Handle the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex
        indexer, _ = self.reindex(target_as_index, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Existing logic for IntervalIndex
        # ...
    else:
        # Existing logic for other cases
        # ...

    return indexer
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `target` is a `CategoricalIndex`, and if so, we use the `reindex` method to obtain the indexer. This change should address the issue with the `TypeError` and make the `round` method work as expected when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
