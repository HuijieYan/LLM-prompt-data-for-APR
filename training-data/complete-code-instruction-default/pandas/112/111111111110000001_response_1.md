The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class within the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file is causing a TypeError during the execution of the test `test_round_interval_category_columns` in the `pandas/tests/frame/test_analytics.py` file. The error occurs when trying to call `get_indexer` with a scalar value, and the function is unable to find a matching signature.

The potential error location within the `get_indexer` function is likely in the line:
```python
indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
```
This line is directly calling the `_engine` function (also present in the `IntervalIndex` class), and as per the error message, there is no matching signature found, resulting in a TypeError.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect use or signature mismatch of the `_engine` function, which is involved in the `get_indexer` function. It seems that the call to `_engine.get_indexer` is not compatible with the type of argument being passed, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the usage of the `_engine` function within the `get_indexer` function needs to be corrected to ensure compatibility with the type of argument being passed. Potential approaches to fixing the bug include modifying the `_engine` function to accept the type of argument being passed or revising the logic within the `get_indexer` function to ensure that the correct arguments are being used with the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the logic remains the same
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        indexer = target_as_index.values.searchsorted(self._values, side=side, sorter=None)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making the necessary changes to ensure compatibility with the `_engine` function, the corrected code should now pass the failing test without raising a TypeError.
