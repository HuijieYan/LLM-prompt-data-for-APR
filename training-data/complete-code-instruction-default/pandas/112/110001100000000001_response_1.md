Potential error location: 
The potential error in the function is that the condition `if self.is_overlapping` is not a function call. It should be `if self.is_overlapping()` to call the function and check its return value.

Bug's cause: 
The bug is caused by not calling the method `is_overlapping` to check if the index is overlapping. This leads to incorrect program flow and potential errors when handling the index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the `is_overlapping` method to properly check if the index is overlapping.
2. Ensure that the method `left.get_indexer`, `right.get_indexer`, `_engine.get_indexer`, and `get_loc` are working as expected and handle non-overlapping cases correctly.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code unchanged
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # rest of the code unchanged
    else:
        # rest of the code unchanged
```
