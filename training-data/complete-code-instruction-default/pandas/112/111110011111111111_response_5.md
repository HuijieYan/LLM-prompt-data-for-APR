The bug in the code is causing the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class to fail when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This is leading to a `TypeError: No matching signature found` error when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with such columns.

The cause of the issue seems to be the way the `get_indexer` method is handling the target index when it is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to handle the case where the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. 

Additionally, the error message in the failing test suggests that the method signature for `get_indexer` needs to be modified to accept the target index as a scalar, so this change needs to be made as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: Union[AnyArrayLike, IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex], method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the code remains unchanged

        elif isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target_as_index.categories)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged

    else:
        # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, we have modified the `get_indexer` method to handle the case where the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. We also modified the method signature to accept the target index as a Union of `AnyArrayLike`, `IntervalIndex`, and `CategoricalIndex`. This change should resolve the `TypeError: No matching signature found` error and ensure that the `round` method works as expected.

With these changes, the code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the `round` method failing when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.
