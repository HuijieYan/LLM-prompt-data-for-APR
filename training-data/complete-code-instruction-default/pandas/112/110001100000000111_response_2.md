1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is responsible for returning the integer indices that would be used to index the input target array, `target`. 
   The mentioned GitHub issue states that the `round` method fails when the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. It seems that the issue lies within the `get_indexer` function when dealing with CategoricalIndex and IntervalIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional statements that handle different types of indexes (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex, etc.), specifically when converting the target_as_index and performing calculations to find the indexer.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a) The buggy function is currently not handling CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly, leading to the failure of the `round` method.
   (b) The related functions like `get_loc`, `is_overlapping`, and `equals` are used within the buggy function and could potentially contribute to the issue with their behavior.
   (c) The GitHub Issue information confirms that the `round` method fails when dealing with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which indicates a problem with how the indexes are being handled in the code.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Adding conditional statements within the buggy function to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex specifically.
   (b) Ensuring that relevant functions like `get_loc`, `is_overlapping`, and `equals` are correctly interacting with the buggy function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        return target.get_indexer(self)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        # rest of the code remains unchanged from the original

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
This corrected code includes a conditional block to handle the case where `target` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. It calls `get_indexer` method of CategoricalIndex which should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
