The buggy function is `get_indexer` defined in the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is trying to find the index of the target values.

The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is trying to round the values in a DataFrame with interval category columns. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to get the indexer for the target values.

The potential error location is where the `get_indexer` method is being called and the target is being passed to the `_engine` to get the indexer. This is where the `TypeError` is being raised.

The cause of the bug could be that the target is not being passed correctly to the `_engine` or there is an issue with the way the `_engine` is handling the target input.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `get_indexer` method to handle the target correctly and ensure that the correct input is passed to the `_engine`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            mapping, _ = lib.interval.get_indexer_non_unique(
                self,
                target_as_index,
                side=side,
                sorter=sorter,
                assume_unique=True,
            )
            indexer = lib.map_infer(mapping, n)
        else:
            # For non-IntervalIndex targets, fall back to default get_indexer
            indexer = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, we use the `lib.interval.get_indexer_non_unique` function to get the indexer for non-IntervalIndex targets, and if the target is an `IntervalIndex`, we directly return the indexer from the mapping obtained from the `get_indexer_non_unique` function.

By making these changes, the `get_indexer` method should now be able to handle the target values correctly and pass them to the `_engine` without causing a `TypeError`. This should make the failing test pass.
