The issue is likely with the method `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class as it is failing to round when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, resulting in a TypeError.

The bug is likely caused by the `get_indexer` method not handling `CategoricalIndex` properly, leading to a TypeError when attempting to round. This discrepancy is evident from the runtime values and types of the variables, as well as the information provided in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method likely needs to be updated to properly handle the rounding of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This could involve implementing specific logic to handle `CategoricalIndex` or making changes to the existing logic to accommodate this case.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
            if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
                target_as_index = target_as_index.categories
            # Rest of the code remains unchanged
            # ... (existing logic for IntervalIndex handling)
        else:
            # Existing logic for handling non-IntervalIndex cases
            # ...
```

In this corrected code, we handle the case where the `target_as_index` is an instance of `CategoricalIndex` by first converting it to `target_as_index.categories` before proceeding with the existing logic for handling `IntervalIndex`.

This approach ensures that the `get_indexer` method can properly handle `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` and should resolve the issue as described in the GitHub post.
