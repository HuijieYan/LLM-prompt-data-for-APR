The issue seems to stem from the `get_indexer` function when a `CategoricalIndex` is used, created from an `IntervalIndex`. It seems that the function is unable to handle `CategoricalIndex` involving `IntervalIndex` properly and results in a TypeError.

The bug location is likely within the `get_indexer` function, specifically in the part where it is trying to handle a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the `get_indexer` function is not properly handling the `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This results in a TypeError when trying to perform operations like rounding.

To fix this issue, the `get_indexer` function needs to be updated to properly handle the scenario where a `CategoricalIndex` involving an `IntervalIndex` is being used. The function should be modified to correctly handle this case and allow operations like rounding to work as expected.

The corrected code for the `get_indexer` function to handle the `CategoricalIndex` involving an `IntervalIndex` would look like the following:

```python
# This is the corrected and updated get_indexer function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        # handle CategoricalIndex created from IntervalIndex
        return self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This updated function will properly handle the case where a `CategoricalIndex` is created from an `IntervalIndex`, allowing operations like rounding to work as expected.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post, enabling the `round` method to work properly when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.
