The bug in the provided function seems to be occurring due to incorrect logic in the comparison of intervals and the creation of the indexer variable. 

Specifically, there is an issue with the logic for non-overlapping intervals, where the left and right indexes are compared to find matches. This logic seems to be incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic for comparing left and right indexes needs to be revised to ensure that the correct matching intervals are identified. Additionally, the dtype and closed attributes of the target_as_index need to be properly handled to determine matches accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or self.dtype != target_as_index.dtype:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        indexer = np.zeros(len(target_as_index), dtype='intp')
        for i, interval in enumerate(target_as_index):
            loc = self.get_loc(interval, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
            if isinstance(loc, slice):
                indexer[i] = loc
            else:
                indexer[i] = -1
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key, method=method, tolerance=tolerance) for key in target_as_index])

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `self.is_overlapping` method is appropriately called as `self.is_overlapping()`.
- The comparison of `self.closed` and `self.dtype` with those of the `target_as_index` is fixed to handle different closed intervals or incompatible subtype intervals.
- The logic for non-overlapping indexes is revised to properly iterate through each interval in the target_as_index and use `self.get_loc` to find matches.

By making these corrections, the function should now handle the input parameters as expected and produce the correct output.
