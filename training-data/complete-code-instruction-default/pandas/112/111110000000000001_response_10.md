1. The buggy function is a method called `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. This method is responsible for returning the indexer for the specified target array-like object. It seems to be comparing elements and returning the indexer based on certain conditions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conditional logic involving comparisons between different indexes and the calculation of the resulting indexer based on these comparisons.

3. The potential cause of the bug could be related to the conditional logic used to determine the indexer for different types of target indexes. There may be issues with how the comparisons are being made or with the handling of different index types.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the conditional logic and comparisons to ensure they are handling different index types properly.
   - Checking for potential edge cases and ensuring that the function can handle different types of inputs correctly.

5. Corrected code:

        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` method is called with parentheses to properly invoke the method. Additionally, the `left` and `right` methods are also invoked with parentheses, and the `_engine` method is similarly invoked. These adjustments ensure that the correct methods are being called and their return values are utilized appropriately.
