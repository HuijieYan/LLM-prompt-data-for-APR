The issue is likely caused by an incorrect implementation of the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test indicates that there is no matching signature found for the `get_indexer` method when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This points to an issue with the method's signature or functionality.

The failing test creates a `DataFrame` with columns as a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex` and then calls the `round` method on the DataFrame. This triggers the `get_indexer` method, which is not handling the `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex` properly, leading to a TypeError.

An analysis of the input parameters and the runtime values and types of the variables used in the `get_indexer` method also highlights that the method is not properly handling the `target_as_index` variable.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to handle the case where `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This can be achieved by updating the logic to properly handle the `target_as_index` variable for both `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the existing logic
        # ...
    else:
        # Existing logic for handling non-IntervalIndex cases
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected code properly handles the case where `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, by converting it to the underlying `IntervalIndex` before proceeding with the existing logic.

With this fix, the `get_indexer` method should properly handle the `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex` case and resolve the TypeError reported in the failing test. This corrected code should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
