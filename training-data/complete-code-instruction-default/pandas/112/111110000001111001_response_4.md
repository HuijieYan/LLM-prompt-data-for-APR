The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping`. The buggy function incorrectly accesses `is_overlapping` as an attribute of the `IntervalIndex` object, when in fact it should be a method call `self.is_overlapping()`.

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `is_overlapping` as an attribute instead of a method call. This leads to the comparison `if self.is_overlapping` always evaluating to `True`, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to call `self.is_overlapping()` as a method instead of accessing it as an attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making this change, the function now correctly checks for overlapping indices and should behave as expected.
