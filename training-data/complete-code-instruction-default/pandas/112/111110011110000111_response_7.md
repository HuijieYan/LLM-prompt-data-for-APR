The bug seems to be occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test is trying to use the `df.round()` method on a DataFrame with columns as a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, which is causing a "No matching signature found" TypeError.

The root cause of the bug is likely due to an issue in the implementation of the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class, which is failing to handle the case when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class to properly handle the case when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
# Fix for the buggy get_indexer method
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.has_overlapping:
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise NotImplementedError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        return super().get_indexer(target_as_index, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
    else:
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
```

This updated `get_indexer` method now properly handles the case when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, and should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.

With this fix, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
