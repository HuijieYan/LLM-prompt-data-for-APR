The potential error in the buggy function is in the conditional check for `if self.is_overlapping`. The buggy code is using `self.is_overlapping` as an attribute and not as a method, so the condition will always be True regardless of the actual value of `is_overlapping()`.

The bug's cause is that the function incorrectly handles the case when `self.is_overlapping` is a method, leading to incorrect branching and further incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly call `self.is_overlapping()` to get the actual boolean value and use it in the conditional check.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code unchanged...
```
