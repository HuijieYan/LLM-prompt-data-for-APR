Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring in the `get_indexer` function, specifically in the logic for handling `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex`.

Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by a TypeError that occurs when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with columns that are `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This is likely due to improper handling of the `CategoricalIndex` in the `get_indexer` function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for handling `CategoricalIndex` in the `get_indexer` function and ensure that it is properly handled.
2. Verify the round method signature to see if it is compatible with the `CategoricalIndex`.
3. Ensure that `round` method handles the input type `CategoricalIndex` correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use " "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
    else:
        # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this corrected code, the `get_indexer` function should properly handle cases where the input is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

Additionally, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved with this fix, and the `round` method should work as expected for a DataFrame with `CategoricalIndex` columns created from an `IntervalIndex`.
