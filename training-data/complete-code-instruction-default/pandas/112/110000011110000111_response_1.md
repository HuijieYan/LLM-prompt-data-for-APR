The error message "TypeError: No matching signature found" suggests that there is an issue with the method signature within the get_indexer function. When the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, the get_indexer method is not able to handle the input properly, leading to the TypeError.

The failing test 'test_round_interval_category_columns' creates a DataFrame with columns as CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex and then calls the round method on it, which eventually triggers the get_indexer method and leads to the TypeError.

The GitHub issue provides additional context about how the issue is encountered in real-world scenarios and the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the get_indexer method needs to be updated to handle the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly and avoid the TypeError.

Approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Updating the method signature to handle CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex properly.
2. Adding conditional checks to differentiate between different types of input and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function 'get_indexer':

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
      # rest of the existing code

    # handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
    elif isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target._data, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    else:
        # handle other cases as before
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        # rest of the existing code

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected code now includes a specific condition to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex and utilizes the get_indexer method accordingly. This should resolve the TypeError and ensure that the round method works as expected for such scenarios. This fix should also address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
