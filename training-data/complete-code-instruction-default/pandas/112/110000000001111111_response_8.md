The buggy function appears to be `get_indexer`. It takes in two `IntervalIndex` objects `self` and `target`, and based on their properties and the input parameters, calculates the `indexer` value. The issue on GitHub is related to the `round` method failing when the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from `IntervalIndex`.

Based on the input/output variable information, it seems that the issue might be with the way the function is handling `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex` as it may not be considering this scenario.

Given that the GitHub issue is related to the `round` method failing on `CategoricalIndex` made from `IntervalIndex`, it's possible that the bug in the `get_indexer` method is causing the incorrect behavior and type mismatch when using `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.

To fix this bug, the function should include handling for `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex` to ensure that it can process such inputs and provide correct output. This might involve updating the logic in the function to handle the specific properties of `CategoricalIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(
        target_as_index.categories, pd.IntervalIndex
    ):
        target_as_index = pd.IntervalIndex.from_breaks(target_as_index.categories)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the logic remains unchanged
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `CategoricalIndex` containing `IntervalIndex` and converted it back to `IntervalIndex` for processing. This approach should allow the `get_indexer` function to handle the case provided in the GitHub issue and produce the expected output.
