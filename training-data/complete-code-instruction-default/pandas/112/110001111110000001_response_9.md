The buggy function seems to be a method `get_indexer` in the `interval.py` file of the pandas library. The method appears to be used to get the index of the specified scalar in the interval index. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is related to the round method, which internally calls the `get_indexer` method.

The error message indicates a 'TypeError: No matching signature found' when trying to get the indexer for the interval. This suggests that there is a mismatch in the method signature or parameters passed to the method, resulting in the error.

Looking at the `get_indexer` method, it appears that the error is possibly due to the function signature and it's usage internally. There might be a type mismatch while passing or when receiving parameters.

To fix the bug, it is important to carefully check the method signature and the way parameters are being passed to the `get_indexer` method. Additionally, the data types of the parameters being passed and received should be validated to ensure that no type mismatch occurs.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to validate the types of parameters being passed to the `get_indexer` method and also ensure that the returned values or operations inside the method are compatible with the expected types.

Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # validation to ensure target is an array-like object
    if not isinstance(target, (np.ndarray, list, tuple)):
        raise ValueError("Target must be array-like")

    # check validity of method
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise NotImplementedError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # rest of the implementation continues here...
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, a validation check for the target parameter has been added to ensure that it is an array-like object. Also, the method signature verification has been explicitly stated in the `get_indexer` method. This aims to address possible mismatches and type errors that were occurring.
