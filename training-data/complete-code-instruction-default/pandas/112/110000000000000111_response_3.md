1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is a function in pandas library that is used to obtain an indexer for an array-like target. The function is related to the GitHub issue because it is failing to handle a specific type of index (CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex), which is causing an error when the `round` method is used on a DataFrame with these types of columns.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely in the section where it checks the type of the index and performs different operations based on the index type.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `get_indexer` is failing to handle a specific type of index (CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex), which leads to errors when other methods, such as `round`, are used on a DataFrame with these columns.
   (b). The GitHub issue states that the `round` method fails when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and it should work as normal.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Identify the specific operations within the function that are causing issues with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
   - Implement conditional checks or specific handling for CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex to ensure that the `round` method and other related methods work as expected.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        # handle IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
    else:
        # handle other types of index
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected code, the function `get_indexer` has been modified to include specific handling for CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. If the index is of this type, it uses the `get_indexer` method of the index itself to obtain the indexer. This modification should address the issue described in the GitHub problem.
