### Analysis:
The failing test is trying to round the DataFrame `df` which has columns of type `pd.CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This is causing an error with the `round` method, leading to a TypeError. The GitHub issue also confirms this problem.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the buggy function, specifically in the block where `target_as_index` is being checked for its type and then passed to the `_engine.get_indexer` method.

### Bug Cause:
The TypeError is being raised because the `get_indexer` method is expecting a scalar target, but it is receiving a `pd.CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, which is causing a mismatch in the method signature.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We need to ensure that the `get_indexer` method is appropriately handling `pd.CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This may involve modifying the method to handle such cases or converting the input to a suitable format before using the `get_indexer` method.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        # ... existing code ...

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # ... existing code ...
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._convert_indexer(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # ... existing code ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)

def _convert_indexer(self, indexer):
    if isinstance(indexer, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(indexer.categories, IntervalIndex):
        return indexer.categories
    return indexer
```

The `get_indexer` method has been modified to handle the `pd.CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` by adding a new method `_convert_indexer` to appropriately convert the input if it is of the problematic type. This corrected function should now handle the rounding operation in the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
