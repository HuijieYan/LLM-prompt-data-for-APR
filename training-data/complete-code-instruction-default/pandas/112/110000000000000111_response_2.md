1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it involves the handling of IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex, which are also mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function 'get_indexer' is used for getting the index of the target values based on certain criteria.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the handling of CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

3. Bug's Cause:
   (a). The buggy function 'get_indexer' is responsible for getting the index of the target values, and it may not be handling CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex correctly.
   (b). The GitHub issue indicates that the 'round' method fails when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which suggests that there is a problem with the handling of these specific types of indices.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Check the implementation of 'get_indexer' to ensure it handles CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex properly.
   (b). Review the handling of IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex to identify any discrepancies.
   (c). Confirm that the 'round' method works correctly with CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (CategoricalIndex, IntervalIndex)):  # Update for handling CategoricalIndex
        target_as_index = target_as_index._values
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected code, we have updated the handling of CategoricalIndex. By checking if the target_as_index is an instance of either CategoricalIndex or IntervalIndex, we can ensure that the CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex is properly handled. Additionally, we have updated target_as_index to use the underlying values to ensure compatibility with the rest of the function. This should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description.
