1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class, which is an immutable index of intervals that are closed on the same side. The function is used to get the numerical index values from an index using non-unique target as input. The GitHub issue is related to the `round` method failing when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that handles the case when the input is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The buggy function `get_indexer` checks if the input is an `IntervalIndex` and tries to handle various cases and perform operations based on the type of input index.
   (b). The `IntervalIndex` class contains several methods that are called by the `get_indexer` function, such as `left`, `right`, `is_overlapping`, and `dtype`.
   (c). The GitHub issue indicates that when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, the `round` method fails, indicating that there is a problem with how the `IntervalIndex` is being handled.
   (d). The issue seems to stem from the fact that the function does not handle `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly, leading to a `TypeError` when the `round` method is called.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   (a). Add a specific handling for `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` within the `get_indexer` function to ensure that the operation can be performed correctly.
   (b). Check for compatibility and handle the unique properties of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` to prevent the `TypeError` when calling the `round` method.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
            # Handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
            return target_as_index.codes
        elif isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Code to handle IntervalIndex as before
            ...
        else:
            # Code to handle other index types as before
            ...

        return ensure_platform_int(target_as_index)
```
In the corrected code, a specific handling for `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` is added to the `get_indexer` function. This allows the function to correctly handle the input and return the numerical index values when the input is of this type.
