Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error in the problematic function lies in the logic for handling the case when the target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the CategoricalIndex in this scenario, leading to the error when using the round method.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling the case when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This results in the round method failing to work as expected and returning a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the function to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly, ensuring that the round method works as expected.
2. Adjust the logic for handling different index types so that CategoricalIndex from IntervalIndex is handled appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = IntervalIndex.from_breaks(target_as_index.categories)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code for handling IntervalIndex as before
    else:
        # remaining code for handling other cases as before
```

In the corrected code, the function has been updated to correctly handle the case when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. It checks if the target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex and if its categories are from an IntervalIndex, then it converts it back to an IntervalIndex. This ensures that the round method will work as expected even when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
