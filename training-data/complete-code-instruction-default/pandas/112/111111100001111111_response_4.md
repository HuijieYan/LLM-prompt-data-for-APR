The bug in the code seems to be caused by the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The method is not correctly handling the case where the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, which is resulting in a `TypeError` when using the `round` method.

To fix this bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be updated to properly handle the case when `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. Specifically, the method should check if the `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# other import statements
from pandas.api.types import is_categorical_dtype

# ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # this is the corrected and updated get_indexer method
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        # handle case when target is CategoricalIndex made from IntervalIndex
        if is_categorical_dtype(target):
            target = target.categories
        
        self._check_method(method)
    
        # rest of the method remains unchanged
```

With this updated code for the `get_indexer` method, it should now be able to handle the case where the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, and the `round` method should no longer fail. This fix resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post.
