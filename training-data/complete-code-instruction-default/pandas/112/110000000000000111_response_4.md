Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring due to the data type mismatch when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns that are of type CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Bug's Cause:
The issue seems to be related to the fact that the `round` method is unable to handle the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, resulting in a TypeError. This is occurring due to the specific implementation of the `get_indexer` function, which is being used internally when applying the `round` method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the data type of the columns before applying the `round` method and handle the CategoricalIndex differently.
2. Update the `get_indexer` function to handle the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex in a way that is compatible with the `round` method.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    # Check for CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = pd.IntervalIndex.from_breaks(target.categories)
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the original code for get_indexer function goes here...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected code, we have added a check to handle the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. If this condition is met, we convert it into an IntervalIndex before proceeding with the rest of the function. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
