Potential error location: The bug may be located in the section of the function where it processes the target variable. It is failing to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which is causing the round method to fail.

Bug cause: The bug is caused by a failure to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex in the get_indexer function. This causes the round method to fail when the columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex, as seen in the GitHub issue.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the get_indexer function to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex appropriately. This can be done by adding a conditional check for CategoricalIndex and processing it accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # existing code
    # ...

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # existing code for IntervalIndex
            # ...
        else:
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # existing code for other cases
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this correction, the get_indexer function should now be able to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex appropriately, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
