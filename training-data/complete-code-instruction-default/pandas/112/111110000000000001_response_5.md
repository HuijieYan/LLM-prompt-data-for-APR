The potential error in the problematic function is that it is redefining the `get_indexer` method, which is already defined in the class `IntervalIndex`. This can cause conflicts and unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the decorator `@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])` is trying to append the documentation of the `get_indexer` method to the method that is being redefined. This is unnecessary and erroneous.

To fix the bug, the redefinition of the `get_indexer` method should be removed, and instead, the existing method should be modified to include the desired functionality.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        # Remove the redundant redefinition here
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        # Rest of the logic follows
        # ...
```

By removing the redundant redefinition of the `get_indexer` method and proceeding with modifying the existing method, we can avoid conflicts and unexpected behavior.
