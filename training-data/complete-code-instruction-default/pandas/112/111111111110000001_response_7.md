The problem is in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test is trying to call the `round` method on a DataFrame, which in turn calls `get_indexer` with a scalar target, triggering a `TypeError: No matching signature found` from `intervaltree.pxi`.

The issue seems to be with the signature of the `get_indexer` method and its parameter `target`. It expects an array-like target (`AnyArrayLike`), but the failing test is passing a scalar target when calling the `round` method.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `get_indexer` method to handle the case when a scalar target is passed to it. We can modify it to accept both array-like and scalar targets and handle them accordingly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:
```python
# Other code remains the same as before

    def get_indexer(self, target: Union[AnyArrayLike, Scalar], method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        if isinstance(target, Scalar):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(target)
                return ensure_platform_int(loc)
            except KeyError:
                return np.array([-1], dtype="intp")
        else:
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

            if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
                # rest of the logic remains unchanged
            # rest of the code
```

In the above corrected code, we have added a check to handle the case when `target` is a scalar. If it is a scalar, we use `get_loc` to try and find the location of the scalar in the IntervalIndex. If found, we return the location as an array, else we return an array with a single value of -1 to indicate not found.

This should fix the issue and make the failing test pass.
