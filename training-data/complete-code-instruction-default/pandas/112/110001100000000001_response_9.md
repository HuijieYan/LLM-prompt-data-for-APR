Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be caused by the conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping:`. The function `is_overlapping` is called as a method, but it should be called as a function in order to check if the intervals are overlapping.

Bug Cause:
The buggy function is trying to determine the index of the target by comparing intervals. The “is_overlapping” method should be called to check if the intervals in the “self” object are overlapping or not. However, the method “is_overlapping” is not being called correctly, resulting in the function not being able to handle overlapping indices properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the way the `is_overlapping` method is called to ensure that it correctly checks for overlapping intervals.
2. Modify the conditional statement and flow control to handle overlapping indices properly.
3. Ensure that the necessary conditions are met before attempting to find the index of the target.
4. Update the handling of different types of target indexes to accommodate potential overlap.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
```
In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` method is called correctly with parenthesis `()` to execute the function and check if the intervals are overlapping. This should fix the issue and ensure that the function properly handles overlapping indices.
