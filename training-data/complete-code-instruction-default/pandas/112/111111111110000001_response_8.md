The buggy function is `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class. This function is responsible for getting the indexer for the target index. The failing test is trying to round a DataFrame with IntervalIndex columns and it fails with a TypeError: No matching signature found.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `get_indexer` method where it calls `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. The error message indicates that there is no matching signature found for this operation.

The bug's cause is likely due to an incorrect or incompatible signature being used when calling `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`.

To address this bug, it would be best to modify how `get_indexer` is calling `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` to ensure it uses a compatible signature. This may involve modifying the input to the `get_indexer` method, or modifying the way it is called within the `get_indexer` method.

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping: # assuming is_overlapping is a property, so calling self.is_overlapping should be self.is_overlapping()
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # code here unchanged
        else:
            # code here unchanged
```
This corrected code is assumed based on the assumption that `is_overlapping` is a property and needs to be accessed using `self.is_overlapping`.
