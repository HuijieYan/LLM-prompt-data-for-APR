The identified bug in the function seems to be related to the conversion of the `target` input to `target_as_index` and the subsequent operations on it. The code currently checks for the type of `target_as_index` and performs different operations based on the type. However, it seems that the conversion of `target_as_index` is not being handled correctly, as the expected value of `target_as_index` does not match the actual output.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the conversion of `target` to `target_as_index` is done correctly, taking into account the data type, closure settings, and other attributes of the `IntervalIndex`. Additionally, the subsequent operations on `target_as_index`, such as checking for equality with `self` and finding common subtypes, should also be reviewed to ensure they are functioning as expected.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        
        return np.where(
            (self.left == target_as_index.left) & (self.right == target_as_index.right),
            self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left),
            -1
        )

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
    
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In this corrected code, the handling of `target_as_index` has been revised to ensure correct conversion and comparison with `self`. The conditional branches have been adjusted to perform the appropriate operations based on the type and attributes of `target_as_index`. Additionally, the correct checks and operations are performed for the different scenarios, such as handling overlapping indices and homogeneous/heterogeneous scalar indices.
