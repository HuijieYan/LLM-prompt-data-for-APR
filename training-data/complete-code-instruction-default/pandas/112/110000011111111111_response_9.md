The bug in the 'get_indexer' function seems to be related to the error message "No matching signature found" when calling the 'round' method on a DataFrame with columns as CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This error suggests there is a type mismatch or issue with function signatures.

The function 'get_indexer' takes a 'target' as input and returns an np.ndarray. Looking at the failing test, the 'round' method is being called on a DataFrame with columns as CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which causes the 'get_indexer' function to be invoked.

The input parameters of the 'get_indexer' function seem to be correct based on the test input. However, the error occurs when the '_engine' attribute is being used to call the 'get_indexer' method with 'target_as_index.values' as input. This error suggests there may be a type mismatch or compatibility issue with the 'target_as_index.values' and the expected input of the '_engine.get_indexer' method.

To fix this bug, the 'get_indexer' function should be modified to ensure that the input passed to '_engine.get_indexer' matches the expected type and signature of the method.

Therefore, the corrected code for the 'get_indexer' function is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this correction, the 'get_indexer' function should be able to handle cases where the input 'target' is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly, ensuring no type mismatches or signature errors occur. This correction should also address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
