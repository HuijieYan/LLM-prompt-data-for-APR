The bug is located in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError with no matching signature found in the `pandas/_libs/intervaltree.pxi` file, which suggests that the bug is related to the implementation of the `get_indexer` method in the IntervalIndex class.

The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` attempts to create a DataFrame using a CategoricalIndex with IntervalIndex values and then calls the `round` method on the DataFrame. This leads to the TypeError with no matching signature found, indicating that the bug is related to rounding operations on DataFrames with CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex columns.

The GitHub issue title and description provide more context about the problem, indicating that the `round` method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class to handle CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex columns properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    if (
        self.is_overlapping()
        and (method is not None or limit is not None or tolerance is not None)
    ):
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "If any method argument other than the default of None is specified as these are not yet implemented."
        )

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        ...  # rest of the original implementation remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for `is_overlapping` to be called as a method and made adjustments to the error-handling conditions. Additionally, we have replaced the `InvalidIndexError` with a `ValueError` to match the exception raised in the corrected code.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and should also make the failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` pass successfully.
