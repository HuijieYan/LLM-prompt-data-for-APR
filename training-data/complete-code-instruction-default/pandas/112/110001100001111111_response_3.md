The issue seems to stem from the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The method is failing to handle the case where the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This is likely due to a mismatch in data types and improper handling of the `CategoricalIndex` in the method.

The GitHub issue describes the problem well, highlighting that the `round` method fails when the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The expected output is for the `round` method to work as normal, regardless of the type of index.

To fix this issue, it is necessary to modify the `get_indexer` method to properly handle the case when `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This may involve type checking and implementing conditional logic to handle the different types of index inputs.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories
        target_dtype = 'interval' + str(target_as_index.categories.dtype)
    else:
        target_dtype = None

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same as original
    # ... [rest of the original code]
```

By adding the conditional check for `CategoricalIndex` and adjusting the handling of `target_as_index`, we can ensure that the appropriate actions are taken based on the type of input index. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug while maintaining the expected input/output behavior of the `get_indexer` method.
