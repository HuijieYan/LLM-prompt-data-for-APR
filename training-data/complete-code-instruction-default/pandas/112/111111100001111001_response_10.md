The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the condition `if self.is_overlapping`. The condition is checking the property `is_overlapping` (presumably to determine if overlapping intervals are present), but it should actually call the method `is_overlapping()` to get the result.

It seems that the function is attempting to handle the case when `self` and `target` are both of type `IntervalIndex`. In this case, it checks for various conditions and calculates the indexer accordingly.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the condition `if self.is_overlapping` with `if self.is_overlapping()`. Additionally, we need to modify how the method `is_overlapping` is called to ensure it returns a boolean value.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Fixed the condition to call the method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ... (code to handle IntervalIndex case)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With these changes, the `get_indexer` function should correctly handle the case when `self` and `target` are both of type `IntervalIndex`, and the condition for checking overlapping intervals is fixed.
