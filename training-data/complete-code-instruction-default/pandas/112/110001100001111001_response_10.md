The bug in the given function is that the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping:` is not properly evaluating the property `is_overlapping` of the `self` object. 

This bug is caused by the fact that `self.is_overlapping` is never called as a method or property of `self`, and therefore it's not getting evaluated properly. We can see that `self.is_overlapping` should actually be `self.is_overlapping()`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional check to properly call the `is_overlapping()` method of `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged...
    # ... (omitting the rest of the code for brevity)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this fix, the conditional check will properly call the `is_overlapping()` method of `self`, and the function should behave as expected based on the provided input variables.
