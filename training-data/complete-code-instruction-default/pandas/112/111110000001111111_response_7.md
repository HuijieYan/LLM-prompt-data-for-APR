The issue seems to be related to the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is failing when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it checks if `target` is an instance of `IntervalIndex` and then performs operations based on that condition.

The bug's cause is that the `get_indexer` function is not handling the case when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, leading to a `TypeError` when the `round` method is called on a `DataFrame` with such columns.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` function to handle the case when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check for this specific case and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# Corrected get_indexer function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target = target.categories

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code remains the same
```

With this fix, the `get_indexer` function should now handle the case when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
