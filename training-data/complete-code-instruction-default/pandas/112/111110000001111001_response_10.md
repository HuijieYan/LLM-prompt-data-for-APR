The potential error in the buggy function is the condition `if self.is_overlapping:`. This condition is checking the value of the method `is_overlapping` rather than calling the method to get its result.

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `self.is_overlapping` without calling the method. This leads to the condition always being true, which results in an InvalidIndexError being raised even when it should not.

To fix the bug, we need to call the method `self.is_overlapping()` to get its result and then use that result in the condition check.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the logic remains unchanged
            # ...
            # (existing code for this part remains the same)
            # ...
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # rest of the logic remains unchanged
            # ...
            # (existing code for this part remains the same)
            # ...
        else:
            # rest of the logic remains unchanged
            # ...
            # (existing code for this part remains the same)
            # ...
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making this change, the function will properly call the `is_overlapping` method to check for overlapping indices, ensuring that the correct logic is followed and the InvalidIndexError is only raised when necessary.
