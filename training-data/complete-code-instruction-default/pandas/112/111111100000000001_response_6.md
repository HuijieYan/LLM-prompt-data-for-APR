The potential error in the buggy function `get_indexer` is the usage of `is_overlapping` as an attribute instead of a method call. It should be replaced with `self.is_overlapping()`. The bug could be caused due to the incorrect usage of the method `is_overlapping` within the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated in the `get_indexer` function by correcting the usage of `is_overlapping` as a method call. Also, the references to some functions like `ensure_index` and `find_common_type` are used without being fully understood due to missing context, so those functions should also be reviewed for potential issues.

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```
By making these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the `get_indexer` function should work as intended.
