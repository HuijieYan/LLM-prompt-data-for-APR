The bug in the code seems to be related to the way the `get_indexer` method is handling IntervalIndex when it's converted to a CategoricalIndex. The TypeError occurs when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with columns that are of a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, as described in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section that handles the conversion of an IntervalIndex to a CategoricalIndex and the subsequent use of the `get_indexer` method.

The bug seems to be caused by improper handling of the IntervalIndex when it's converted to a CategoricalIndex and then used with the `round` method. The relationship between the buggy function and the related classes and functions indicates that the issue lies in the specific implementation of the `get_indexer` method for this scenario.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `get_indexer` method to properly handle the case where the input target is of a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. This involves modifying the logic for handling different types of indexes and ensuring that the conversion and indexing process is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method that should resolve the issue:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
            target_as_index = target.categories  # use the original IntervalIndex for indexing
        else:
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        # rest of the method remains unchanged
        # ...
```

This corrected code will ensure that the `get_indexer` method properly handles the case where the input target is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
