The bug is likely caused by the `get_indexer` method failing to handle the input when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This leads to a `TypeError: No matching signature found` error when the `round` method is called on the DataFrame in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to handle `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly.

Here's a possible approach to fixing the bug:
1. Check if the target input is a `CategoricalIndex` and if it is, extract the `IntervalIndex` from it. 
2. Then, use the extracted `IntervalIndex` to perform the necessary calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code remains the same

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this correction, the `TypeError: No matching signature found` error should be resolved, and the failing test should pass. This should also address the issue posted in the GitHub report.
