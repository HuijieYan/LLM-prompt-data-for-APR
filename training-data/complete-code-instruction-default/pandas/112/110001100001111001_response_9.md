The potential error in the buggy function is in the conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping`. The `self.is_overlapping` attribute is a method, so it should be called as `self.is_overlapping()` instead of being treated as a boolean. This mistake is causing the code to execute the wrong block of code, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the `self.is_overlapping` attribute should be called as `self.is_overlapping()` to correctly check if the method returns True or False.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Corrected: Call the method to get the boolean value
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly check for overlapping indices and execute the appropriate block of code, leading to the expected output based on the provided runtime values and types.
