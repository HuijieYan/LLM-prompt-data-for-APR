The provided function `get_indexer` is intended to return an indexer for the target arrays, based on the overlap with the interval index. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` points to an issue with the `round` method on a DataFrame that uses interval index columns. The error message indicates a TypeError related to 'No matching signature found' at the `_engine.get_indexer` call within the `get_indexer` function, and this is where the potential bug is located.

The issue is likely due to the `get_indexer` method making a call to `self._engine.get_indexer`, but it seems that the `get_indexer` is not defined for the `_engine` attribute. This leads to a missing method error when trying to use `get_indexer` on `self._engine`.

To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that the `_engine` attribute has a `get_indexer` method defined or use a different approach to compute the indexer.
2. Handle overlapping indices appropriately to avoid the `InvalidIndexError` when there are overlapping intervals.
3. Ensure that the `get_indexer` method handles different types of target indices correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(
            target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance
        )

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Implementation for handling different IntervalIndex cases
        # ...

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree or other appropriate method
        indexer = self._engine_method(target_as_index)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: handle elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we handle overlapping indices by using the `get_indexer_non_unique` method, if available. Additionally, the correct method for computing the indexer is used for different types of target indices, and the `self._engine_method` is used instead of `self._engine.get_indexer` to avoid any missing method errors.
