Potential Error Location: The buggy function get_indexer is responsible for the error. It is not handling CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly, which is causing the round method to fail.

Bug Cause:
(a). The buggy function get_indexer is not handling the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly, leading to the failure of the round method.
(b). The IntervalIndex class and its related functions are not handling the conversion of CategoricalIndex properly, leading to the error.
(c). The related functions like _check_method, is_overlapping, and _maybe_convert_i8 are not properly handling the CategorialIndex.
(d). The GitHub issue provides a clear demonstration of how the bug occurs and the expected output.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the get_indexer function to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly.
2. Check for the specific type of Index in get_indexer and handle it accordingly.
3. Update the related functions in the IntervalIndex class to ensure proper handling of CategoricalIndex.
4. Test the round method with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex after making the necessary changes.

Corrected Code for the problematic function get_indexer:

```python
# ... (other code remains unchanged)

@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        target = target.categories  # Handle CategoricalIndex

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # Ensure to handle CategoricalIndex in the subsequent code as well

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)

```
The corrected code includes handling the CategoricalIndex properly by converting it to its categories before further processing. This modification should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
