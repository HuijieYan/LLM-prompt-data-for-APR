The potential error within the problematic function is the `self.is_overlapping` condition. It seems like this condition is meant to check whether the intervals are overlapping or not, and based on that further operations are carried out. However, it seems that the condition is not being checked correctly and is causing the program to raise an error.

The bug's cause is that the `self.is_overlapping` condition might not be functioning as intended. It is likely meant to check if the intervals are overlapping, but it is used without any method call, so it's always evaluating to True, which is not the desired behavior.

To fix this bug, `self.is_overlapping` should be called as a method `self.is_overlapping()` to check if the intervals are overlapping. This will return a boolean value based on which further operations can be carried out.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By calling `self.is_overlapping()` as a method, the correct behavior of checking if the intervals are overlapping is achieved.
