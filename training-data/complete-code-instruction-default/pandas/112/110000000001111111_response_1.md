The bug originates in the get_indexer function where the TypeError: No matching signature found occurs when the round method is used on a DataFrame with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The input values and types are correct, but the function is failing to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, resulting in the TypeError.

The cause of the bug is that the function get_indexer does not handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly. This leads to a Type error when trying to use the round method on a DataFrame with such columns.

To fix the bug, we need to update the get_indexer function to properly handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check to handle this specific case and perform the appropriate operations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        # handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged as it is handling IntervalIndex

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This updated code includes a conditional check to handle the case when the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. When this condition is met, the target is reassigned to its categories, which are then handled as an IntervalIndex as per the original code. This should resolve the issue with the round method failing and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

The corrected code should also successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub, allowing the round method to work as expected even when the columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.
