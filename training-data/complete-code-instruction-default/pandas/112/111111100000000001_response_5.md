The potential error in the buggy function lies in the following code block:
```python
if self.is_overlapping:
    msg = (
        "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
        "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
    )
    raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
```
The `self.is_overlapping` condition is missing parentheses for a function call. This is causing the is_overlapping function to be always considered as True, leading to an incorrect raise of InvalidIndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly check the return value of the is_overlapping function.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # remaining code for the function...
    # ...
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the `self.is_overlapping` condition has been updated to `self.is_overlapping()`, which correctly calls the function and checks its return value for the condition. This change fixes the bug and ensures that the is_overlapping function is evaluated properly before raising the InvalidIndexError.
