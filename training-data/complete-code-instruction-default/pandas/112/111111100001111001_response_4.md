The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping` which should be `if self.is_overlapping()`. The is_overlapping function is a method of the class and should be called as such.

The buggy function is trying to check if the IntervalIndex object is overlapping and based on that, it performs different actions. However, the is_overlapping attribute of the class is a method and should be called as a method to return the boolean value indicating if the index is overlapping.

To fix the bug, we need to change `if self.is_overlapping` to `if self.is_overlapping()` to properly call the method and get the correct boolean value.

Below is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the method to get the boolean value
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # remaining code remains unchanged
```

By making this fix, the buggy function should now correctly check if the index is overlapping and proceed with the appropriate actions accordingly.
