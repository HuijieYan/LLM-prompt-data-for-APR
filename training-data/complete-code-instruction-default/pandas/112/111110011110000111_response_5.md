The issue is with the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. When the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, the `round` method fails with a `TypeError: No matching signature found`. This problem has been reported on GitHub with the title "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex".

The issue seems to be with the way the `get_indexer` method handles the input when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` method to handle the input correctly in the case where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    result = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    return result
```

With this modification, the `get_indexer` method should properly handle the input when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, and the `round` method should work as expected.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test case for the `round` method passes.
