1. The buggy function is a method called `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. This class inherits from `IntervalMixin` and `Index`. The function serves the purpose of finding the indexer for the input target array.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `if self.is_overlapping:`. The condition `self.is_overlapping` should actually be a call to the `is_overlapping` method, not a direct attribute access.

3. The bug's cause is due to improperly accessing the `is_overlapping` attribute as a property, while it should be accessed as a method. This incorrect access leads to improper handling of the overlapping condition, which can possibly result in runtime errors or incorrect computation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Correctly calling the `is_overlapping` method to check for overlapping intervals.
   b. Ensuring that any method calls are correctly accessed within the context of the class.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
        
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, `self.is_overlapping` has been replaced with `self.is_overlapping()` to correctly call the method and handle the condition.
