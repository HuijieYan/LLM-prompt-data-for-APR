The bug in the provided function is that the condition `if self.is_overlapping` is never actually evaluating the `self.is_overlapping` function, but instead is just checking if the function itself exists. As a result, the code always executes the block that follows the `if` statement, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to actually call the `self.is_overlapping()` function to get its result and then use that result in the `if` condition.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # remaining code as is
    # ...
```

With this correction, the function will correctly evaluate the `is_overlapping` function and behave according to its result.

This fix ensures that the function now satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
