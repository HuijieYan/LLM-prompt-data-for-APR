1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the class `DataFrameGroupBy` in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. The function is responsible for aggregating data using the `how` parameter, but it throws a TypeError when using the nullable integer data type.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when it tries to cast the block back to the original dtype. This is where the TypeError is likely occurring due to invalid type conversion.

3. The bug's cause is related to the handling of nullable integer data type during aggregation. The function tries to perform type conversions that are not valid for nullable integers, resulting in a TypeError. This is evident from the GitHub issue where using the new nullable integer data type results in a TypeError when calling the mean function after grouping.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the function properly handles nullable integer data type when performing aggregation.
   - Validating the type conversions and casting operations to accommodate nullable integer data type.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function that resolves the issue:

```python
# The corrected code for the problematic function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Remaining unchanged code from original function...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Remaining unchanged code from original function...

        if result is not no_result:
            # Remaining unchanged code from original function...

            if result is not no_result:
                # Remaining unchanged code from original function...

                if block.dtype.name == 'Int64':
                    # Handle nullable integer data type
                    result = block.values.to_numpy().astype(float)
                else:
                    result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                    
                # Remaining unchanged code from original function...

    # Remaining unchanged code from original function...
```

In the corrected code, we added a specific condition to handle nullable integer data type when performing aggregation. If the block has an 'Int64' dtype, we convert the values to a numpy array and cast to a float to ensure valid type conversion for aggregation. This modification should resolve the TypeError when using the nullable integer data type with the mean function after grouping.
