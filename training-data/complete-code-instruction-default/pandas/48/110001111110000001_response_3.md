The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is trying to safely cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64, causing a TypeError. This results in the failing test cases due to the inability to safely cast the values.

To fix the bug, the logic of casting the values needs to be revised to ensure that non-equivalent float64 values can be safely cast to int64.

One approach to fixing this bug is to modify the logic of the safe_cast function to handle the casting from float64 to int64 by checking for non-equivalent values and then casting them safely.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # previous code...

        if result is not no_result:
            if block.dtype == np.float64:
                # check if the result is non-equivalent to the original float64 values
                if not np.array_equal(result, block.values.astype(np.float64)):
                    result = result.astype(np.float64)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        # previous code...

    # remaining code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected function includes an additional check for non-equivalent float64 values and attempts to cast them safely if needed. This should resolve the TypeError in the failing test cases.
