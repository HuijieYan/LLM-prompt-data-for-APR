The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be encountering a type conversion issue where it is trying to cast float values to integer values, resulting in a `TypeError`. This is likely causing the failing test as the expected output is float while the function is trying to cast it to integer.

The issue originates from the line:
```python
result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype)
```
This line is attempting to convert the result to the original dtype of `block.values`, which can result in a TypeError if the original dtype is int and the result is float.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the result maintains its float dtype if it's a float. One approach to fix this bug is to modify the code to cast the result as float if it's not already a float.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other code)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (other code)

        # Instead of using type(block.values)._from_sequence, manually cast result to float if it's not already a float
        scalar_dtype = np.array([1]).dtype
        result_dtype = result.dtype
        if np.issubdtype(scalar_dtype, np.floating) and not np.issubdtype(result_dtype, np.floating):
            result = result.astype(np.float64)

        # ... (other code)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
This code checks if the `scalar_dtype` of the original block is of type float and if the `result_dtype` is not already a float, then explicitly casts the result to float.

By making this change, the function should now handle the type conversion correctly and pass the failing test without encountering a TypeError related to type casting.
