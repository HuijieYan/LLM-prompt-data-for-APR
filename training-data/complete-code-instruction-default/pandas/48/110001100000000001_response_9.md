The potential error in the provided code is caused by various reasons including the possibility of missing imports or incorrect variable assignments, as well as potential logical errors. However, without additional context or specific error messages, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the bug.

To fix the potential bug:

1. Analyze the code to understand the logic and expected behavior.
2. Debug the code by inserting print statements or using a debugger to trace the flow of execution.
3. Identify any potential logical errors or incorrect variable usage.
4. Ensure that all necessary imports are included and that variable assignments are correct.
5. Test the code with different inputs to verify the correctness of the fix.

Below is the corrected code for the provided function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            agg_blocks.append(result._data.blocks[0])
        else:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
