The issue is likely caused by a type casting error when calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer (Int64) dtype. It seems that the type casting from float64 to int64 is causing a TypeError.

The potential error location within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely when casting the data from float64 to int64, specifically when calling the mean function on the grouped data.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type casting from float64 to int64 is handled correctly when calling the mean function on the data.

Based on the potential error location and the failing test case, a possible approach for fixing the bug would be to implement a custom mean function that handles nullable integers correctly, by first converting the nullable integers to float64, calculating the mean, and then converting the result back to nullable integers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        # Try to handle nullable integer means correctly
        if block.dtype.kind == 'i' and pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
            result = block.values.astype(float).mean(axis=1)
            result = result.astype(block.dtype)
        else:
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # ... (handling for non-applicable functions)
        
        # ... (other code remains the same)

    # ... (other code remains the same)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
``` 

By handling the nullable integer means correctly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
