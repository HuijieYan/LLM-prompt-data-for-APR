The problem is occurring when calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype. This results in a TypeError. The issue seems to be related to safe casting of values, particularly from float64 to int64 in the _cython_agg_blocks method of the DataFrameGroupBy class.

The error message indicates that the values cannot be safely cast from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe', which is the cause of the TypeError.

The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem and the expected output, along with the environment details.

To fix the bug, the safe casting of values from float64 to int64 needs to be reviewed and modified to handle the nullable integer data type correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code should resolve the TypeError when calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype and should also address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
