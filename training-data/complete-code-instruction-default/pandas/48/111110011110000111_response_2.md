The bug is occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. It seems that the error is related to casting non-equivalent float64 values to int64, which is caused by calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions after grouping a DataFrame with nullable integer values.

The error message in the failing test indicates that there is a problem with casting float64 to int64 due to non-equivalent values, which aligns with the issue reported on GitHub about calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with nullable integer dtype resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this issue, one possible approach is to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer values properly and ensure that the casting from float64 to int64 is done correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

        for block in data.blocks:
            result = block.float_type()._from_sequence(
                block.values.astype(float), dtype=float
            )
            result = result.dropna()._agg(how=how, min_count=min_count)

            if result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.iloc[0]
            else:
                result = result._data

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs)

            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        # rest of the function remains the same
        # ...

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code ensures that when performing aggregation on nullable integer values, the casting to float64 is done correctly, and the resulting aggregation is handled appropriately for nullable integer data.

This fix should address the TypeError issue and ensure that the failing test for applying mean, median, and var on nullable integer values returns the expected output. This will also resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
