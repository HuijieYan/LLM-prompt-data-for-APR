The potential error in the buggy function lies within the block that handles the result of the aggregation. It seems that there are multiple scenarios that can lead to errors, such as when no results are found or when split blocks are present.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add conditional checks to handle each scenario separately and ensure that the aggregation results are handled correctly in each case.

Another approach could be to simplify the logic for handling the aggregation results to make it more robust and less error-prone, as the current implementation seems to be quite complex and prone to errors.

Here's the corrected code with some added conditional checks and simplified logic to handle the aggregation results:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    # ... previous code ...

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # ... previous code ...

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                # handle alternative aggregation method
                result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)
        finally:
            if result is no_result:
                # handle case when no result is found
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            elif isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                # handle case when result is a DataFrame
                # ... logic to handle DataFrame result ...
            else:
                # handle regular aggregation result
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # ... the remaining code ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
By adding conditional checks and simplifying the logic for handling the aggregation results, this corrected version of the code should be more robust and less error-prone.
