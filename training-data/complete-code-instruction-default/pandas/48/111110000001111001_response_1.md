Based on the provided input/output variable information, it is evident that the issue in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function lies in the handling of the result when `NotImplementedError` is caught. This results in incorrect aggregation and a subsequent failure to return the expected output.

As a fix, the code should handle the `NotImplementedError` exception in a way that ensures the correct aggregation is performed. Additionally, the correction should ensure that the final aggregated result aligns with the expected output based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                result = result._try_cast(result)
            else:
                raise
        if result is not no_result:
            agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
            new_items.append(locs)

    # Rest of the code for handling split blocks and returning the agg_blocks and agg_items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This correction ensures that the `NotImplementedError` is handled appropriately by either performing an alternative aggregation or re-raising the exception if no alternative is provided. It also ensures that the final aggregated result aligns with the expected output based on the input parameters.
