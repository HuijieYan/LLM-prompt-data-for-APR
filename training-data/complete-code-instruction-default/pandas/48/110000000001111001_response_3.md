The issue in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the calculation of result which is being derived from the `self.grouper.aggregate` method. The function is working with numeric data and trying to perform aggregation operations. It is encountering issues with numeric aggregation for some specific operations such as mean, median, and var.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to handle the specific cases where the aggregate method is failing for certain operations like mean, median, and var. We can catch these errors and perform the operations in an alternate way.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with the specific handling for mean, median, and var operations:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import Block
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas.core.internals.managers import BlockManager

class YourClass:
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # generally if we have numeric_only=False
                # and non-applicable functions
                # try to python agg
                if alt is None:
                    # we cannot perform the operation
                    # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                    assert how == "ohlc"
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

                # call our grouper again with only this block
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame
                    #  reductions; see GH#28949
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                
                if how == 'mean':
                    result = s.mean()
                elif how == 'median':
                    result = s.median()
                elif how == 'var':
                    result = s.var()
                else:
                    # handle other operations here
                   pass

            # Rest of the code remains the same...
```
