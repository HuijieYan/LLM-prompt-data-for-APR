1. The problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which inherits from the `GroupBy` class. The method calls the `_get_data_to_aggregate` method, which is not directly related to the root cause of the bug. The GitHub issue mentions that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the section where the method is iterating over the data blocks and attempting to perform aggregation operations. This is likely where the code is not handling the `Int64` dtype correctly and resulting in a `TypeError`.

3. Cause of the bug:
   (a). The problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks` is meant to perform aggregation operations on numerical data, but it is encountering issues when dealing with the `Int64` dtype.
   (b). The `DataFrameGroupBy` class inherits from `GroupBy` and the `GroupBy` class contains the method `aggregate`, which is called by the buggy function.
   (c). The function `_get_data_to_aggregate` retrieves the data to be aggregated, but does not seem to be directly causing the issues mentioned in the GitHub issue.
   (d). The GitHub issue information points out that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the code within `_cython_agg_blocks` to handle the `Int64` dtype correctly and ensure that aggregation operations work as expected.
   (b). Check for the `Int64` dtype specifically and implement a suitable handling mechanism to prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
   (c). Add type-checking and type-casting logic to ensure that the aggregation operations are compatible with the data types being used.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Handle Int64 dtype specifically for aggregation
        if block.dtype == 'Int64':
            block_values = block.values.astype('float64')
        else:
            block_values = block.values

        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block_values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the code remains the same for reordering the agg_blocks

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code handles the `Int64` dtype specifically by converting the values to `float64` before performing aggregation. This approach ensures that the `Int64` dtype is compatible with the aggregation operations and prevents the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
