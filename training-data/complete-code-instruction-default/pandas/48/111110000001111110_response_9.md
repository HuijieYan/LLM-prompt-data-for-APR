The issue with the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is that it is failing when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `std` methods on a DataFrame with Int64 dtype. It is currently resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this issue, the `_cython_agg_blocks` method needs to be modified to handle calculations for columns with an integer dtype. Specifically, the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function should be called with the result to handle any numeric data types.

Here's the modified `_cython_agg_blocks` method to fix the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing implementation

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... existing implementation
        if result is not no_result:
            # Cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            # block.dtype refers to the original dtype of the block

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # ... existing implementation

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... existing implementation
```

This modification ensures that the result is properly cast back to the original dtype after the calculation, thus resolving the TypeError issue when calling `mean`, `median`, and `std` on Int64 dtype.

This fix should handle the calculations correctly for Int64 dtype and resolve the TypeError issue.
