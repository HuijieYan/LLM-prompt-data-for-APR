The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be causing an error related to casting from float64 to int64 when using certain aggregation functions like mean, median, and var. The error message mentions the `safe_cast` function in `pandas/core/arrays/integer.py` and indicates that the array cannot be cast from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64').

This error occurs when the code tries to cast float64 values to int64 within the `safe_cast` function. This issue is likely caused by the aggregation process of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, where it attempts to convert float64 values to int64.

To fix this bug:
1. Avoid casting float64 values to int64 where it's not appropriate.
2. Instead, keep the values as float64 to avoid the casting error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # other code remains the same

        if result is not no_result:
            # change here: keep the result as float, avoid casting to int
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result.astype(float))

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # The remaining code remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By keeping the result as float and avoiding the casting to int, the updated function should pass the failing test and resolve the casting error.
