The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be intended for aggregating data, particularly for handling numeric data. It is called in a context where grouping and aggregation are involved. The input parameters `numeric_only`, `how`, `min_count`, `self.obj`, and `self.axis` are relevant to its functionality.

The potential error seems to be related to the aggregation of numeric data. The function seems to be incorrectly applying a statistical aggregation method and failing to yield the expected results.

Approaches for fixing the bug could involve revising the aggregation logic, potentially addressing the way numeric data is aggregated or handling certain edge cases differently.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.evaluate_agg(how=how, axis=1, alt=alt, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This updated function uses the `evaluate_agg` method to handle the aggregation of numeric data, which should provide a more reliable and correct result based on the input parameters. It also maintains the same expected input/output variables as the original buggy function.
