## Bug Analysis

The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing a `TypeError` when applying certain functions to a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype. The Error message from the failing test indicates that the error occurs when trying to cast an array from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64' according to the rule 'safe'.

The GitHub issue provides an example where calling `mean` after grouping on a DataFrame with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it tries to cast the block values back to the original dtype after aggregation, causing the `TypeError`.

## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the incorrect casting of values from 'float64' to 'int64' when working with nullable integer data type (`Int64`) and applying certain aggregate functions.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug

1. Check the dtype of the values being operated on and perform appropriate type casting based on the dtype.
2. Handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) differently to ensure correct behavior during aggregation.
3. Validate the type conversion rules and ensure that compatible type casting is performed.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code...

        if result is not no_result:
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype == np.float64:
                # If the result is of type float64, we need to handle it carefully
                # to avoid type casting issues
                result = np.asarray(result, dtype=block.dtype)
                if block.dtype == np.int64 and np.isnan(result).any():
                    # If the original block dtype is int64 and result contains NaN,
                    # we need to convert it to Int64 type to preserve nullability
                    result = pd.array(result, dtype="Int64")

                result = result.ravel()
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # existing code...
```

With the above correction, we handle the type casting based on the original block dtype and ensure proper handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
