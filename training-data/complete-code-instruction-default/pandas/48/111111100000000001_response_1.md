The potential error location within the problematic function could be the way that the function is iterating through the `data.blocks` and trying to handle different scenarios in aggregating the data.

The bug's cause seems to be related to the handling of different data types and the aggregation of split blocks, which leads to incorrect results or potential errors in the aggregation process.

One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to refactor the iteration and aggregation logic to handle different data types and split blocks more effectively, ensuring that the aggregation process is consistent and correct across all scenarios.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for loc, block in enumerate(data.blocks):
        agg_block, new_item = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, min_count)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(new_item)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return self._rearrange_blocks(agg_blocks, new_items, data)


def _aggregate_block(self, block, how, alt, min_count):
    locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
    result = self._try_aggregate(block, how, alt, min_count)

    if result is not None:
        return self._create_agg_block(result, block), locs
    return None, None


def _try_aggregate(self, block, how, alt, min_count):
    result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
    return result


def _create_agg_block(self, result, block):
    if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
        result = result._data.blocks[0].values
    if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
        result = result.reshape(1, -1)
        
    result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
    return block.make_block(result)


def _rearrange_blocks(self, agg_blocks, new_items, data):
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the problematic function `cython_agg_blocks` has been refactored to separate the aggregation logic into different methods `_aggregate_block`, `_try_aggregate`, `_create_agg_block`, and `_rearrange_blocks`. This separation of concerns allows for a clearer and more manageable approach to handling the different scenarios in the aggregation process. Additionally, splitting the logic into smaller, more specialized methods will help in understanding and debugging the code.
