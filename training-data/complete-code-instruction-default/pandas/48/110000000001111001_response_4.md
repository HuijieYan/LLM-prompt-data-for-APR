The issue in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be related to the aggregation of data and manipulation of block and item indices. It appears that in certain cases, the `agg_block` is not being correctly added to `agg_blocks` and the corresponding `mgr_locs` are not being updated properly. This is likely causing incorrect aggregation results.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `agg_block` is correctly created and added to `agg_blocks` for all cases, and that the `mgr_locs` are updated accordingly. We also need to address the case where `split_items` are present, as the cleanup of the split blocks seems to be incomplete.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                split_items.append(locs)
                split_frames.append(result)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                assert result.ndim == 2
                if result.shape[0] == 1:
                    try:
                        result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype)
                    except ValueError:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
        for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
            new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
            new_agg_block = result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0]
            agg_blocks.append(new_agg_block)

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code ensures that the `agg_block` is correctly added to `agg_blocks` and addresses the cleanup of split blocks. This should resolve the issues observed in the input/output variable information provided.
