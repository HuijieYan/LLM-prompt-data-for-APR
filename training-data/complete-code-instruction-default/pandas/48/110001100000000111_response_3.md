1. The buggy function _cython_agg_blocks is used for applying aggregation methods to grouped data in a pandas DataFrame. The function is related to the aggregate and _get_data_to_aggregate functions in the same file. The GitHub issue is related to calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where the grouping operation is performed and the aggregate function is called. It seems that the function is not handling the Int64 dtype correctly.

3. The bug's cause is that the _cython_agg_blocks function does not handle the Int64 dtype correctly when performing aggregation operations, leading to a TypeError. The buggy function is trying to aggregate numeric data but is not handling the Int64 dtype properly. This is causing the TypeError when calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Handling the Int64 dtype explicitly in the _cython_agg_blocks function to ensure it is properly handled during aggregation operations.
   - Checking for the dtype and explicitly handling the Int64 dtype within the function to avoid the TypeError.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        # Handle Int64 dtype explicitly
        if data.items.dtype == 'Int64':
            if how in ['mean', 'median', 'std']:
                result = block.values.astype(float).mean(axis=1)
            else:
                result = block.values
        else:
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle other cases
                continue

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

It is important to note that the above corrected code includes the explicit handling of the Int64 dtype when performing aggregation operations, and checks for special cases such as mean, median, and std to avoid the TypeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.
