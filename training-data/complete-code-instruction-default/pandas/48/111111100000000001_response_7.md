Based on the given code, it looks like the potential error location within the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to how the loop is structured. The loop involves multiple operations like creating lists and appending items which could potentially lead to errors due to incorrect iterations. 

The cause of the bug is that the loop structure within the `cython_agg_blocks` function is complex and involves multiple conditional branches, list manipulations, and method invocations. This complexity increases the likelihood of errors due to incorrect iterations, suboptimal memory management, and unexpected conditional outcomes.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to simplify the loop and introduce clear conditional branches to handle different scenarios. Additionally, proper error handling should be included to prevent unexpected exceptions from stopping the loop and causing the function to fail. It is also important to ensure that the loop iterations and block manipulations are consistent and accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if alt is not None and isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            s = get_groupby(self.obj[data.items[locs]], self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            try:
                result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                    result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                )
            except ValueError:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the loop structure has been simplified, and conditional branches are used to handle different scenarios. Error handling is also clearly defined to prevent unexpected exceptions from stopping the loop. This should help in fixing the potential bug and ensuring the proper functioning of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
