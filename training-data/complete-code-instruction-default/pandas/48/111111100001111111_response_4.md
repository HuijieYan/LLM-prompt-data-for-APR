The issue seems to be related to how the DataFrameGroupBy class handles aggregation functions, particularly when dealing with nullable integer data types.

After analyzing the buggy function and related information, it appears that the bug is caused by the handling of nullable integer data types within the _cython_agg_blocks function. It seems that the function is not properly handling nullable integer data types when calling aggregation functions such as mean, median, and var.

To fix the bug, the _cython_agg_blocks function needs to be updated to handle nullable integer data types properly when performing aggregation. This may involve adjusting the way the function interacts with nullable integer data types and ensuring that the aggregation functions can handle these data types correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        agg_items: List[Index] = []

        for block in data.blocks:
            if block.dtype.kind == 'i' and block.isNullable:
                agged = block._try_aggregate(how, min_count)

                if agged is None:
                    raise NotImplementedError(f"Cannot handle {block.dtype} with {how}")

                agg_block = block.make_block(agged)
                new_items = block.mgr_locs[agger_block.mgr_locs]
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
                agg_items.append(data.items[np.sort(new_items)])

        if not (agg_blocks):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, we are explicitly checking for nullable integer data types and using the _try_aggregate method to handle aggregation appropriately. We also ensure that the agg_items are sorted to match the original data ordering.

This corrected code should address the bug and ensure that the aggregation functions can handle nullable integer data types correctly, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub report.
