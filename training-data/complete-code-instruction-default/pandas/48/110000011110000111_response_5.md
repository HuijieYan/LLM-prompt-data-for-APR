The bug is likely caused by the function `_from_sequence` attempting to cast float64 to int64, resulting in a TypeError. This occurs when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the casting of float64 to int64 when calculating the mean. Additionally, we should ensure that the function handles the Int64 dtype correctly when performing the aggregation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, TypeError):
            # Handle case where TypeError is raised
            result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            if is_numeric_dtype(block.dtype):
                result = result.astype(block.dtype)  # Safely cast to the original dtype
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code handles the safe casting of result values to the original block's dtype and ensures that the mean calculation and aggregation are performed correctly for Int64 dtype.

With these changes, the function should now handle mean calculations on Int64 dtype without raising a TypeError, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
