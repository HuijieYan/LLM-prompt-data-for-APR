1. The buggy function _cython_agg_blocks is part of the DataFrameGroupBy class and is called when using the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy object. The function uses the grouper to perform aggregation on numeric data, but the error occurs when calling the mean function on an Int64 data type, resulting in a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when calling the mean function on the grouper.aggregate during aggregation.

3. The bug's cause is that the _cython_agg_blocks function does not handle the aggregation of Int64 data type correctly within the grouper.aggregate function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Handling the aggregation of Int64 data type correctly within the aggregation function and handling the TypeError gracefully.
   - Checking for the data type before performing the aggregation and using a different approach for nullable integer data types.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.values.dtype) and block.values.dtype.kind == 'i':
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, 'mean', axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

This approach checks if the block values are of integer data type and then directly calls the mean aggregation instead of relying on the grouper.aggregate function to handle the aggregation of Int64 data type. This should resolve the TypeError that occurs when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with an Int64 dtype.
