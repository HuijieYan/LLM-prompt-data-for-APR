The problematic function appears to be the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the pandas library. The function is used to perform aggregation on numeric data.

The error seems to occur when calling certain aggregation functions like mean, median, and standard deviation on DataFrameGroupBy objects with nullable integer (Int64) dtype. The error is TypeError, and it occurs because the function is not handling the nullable integer dtype properly.

The expected output should be the result of the aggregation operation, such as calculating the mean, median, etc. on the grouped data.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the nullable integer dtype when performing aggregation operations. This may involve checking for and handling the null values properly within the aggregation logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block._try_aggregate(how, min_count=min_count)
  
        if result is not None:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(np.array([block.mgr_locs._slice], dtype=block.mgr_locs._dtype))
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This code should handle nullable integer values properly and perform the aggregation operation as expected.
