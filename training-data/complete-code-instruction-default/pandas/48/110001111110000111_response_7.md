This bug is caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function which is not handling nullable integers correctly, leading to a TypeError when calling certain aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it is trying to cast the result to the original dtype. It seems to be assuming that the result will always be of the same dtype as the original data, which is not the case for nullable integers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integers correctly and ensure that the cast to the original dtype is handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            # Handle an additional step for nullable integers
            if is_integer_dtype(block.values.dtype):
                result = result.astype('Int64')
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the fallback for certain functions
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            # Handle the alternate aggregation
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                # Handle the nullable integer type
                if is_integer_dtype(result.dtypes.get(0)):
                    result = result.astype('Int64')

        # Handle the rest of the code for result processing

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code handles the case of nullable integers correctly by explicitly checking for integer data types and casting the result to 'Int64' as needed.

This fix should address the issue of calling certain aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, and it should also resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.
