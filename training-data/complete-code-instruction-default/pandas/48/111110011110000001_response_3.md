The issue lies in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The error is related to the safe casting of non-equivalent `float64` to `int64` data type.

The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of data type casting from `float64` to `int64`. The error occurs when trying to cast the data which is of type `float` to `int`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the type casting in a way that ensures the safe conversion of non-equivalent `float64` to `int64`. This can be achieved by using appropriate conversion methods for data type casting.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@pin_whitelisted_properties(DataFrame, base.dataframe_apply_whitelist)
class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):

    # ... (other methods)

    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Exception handling code...

            if result is not no_result:
                # Handle casting of non-equivalent data types
                result = result.astype(np.int64)

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        # Rest of the function...

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we've added a step to handle the type casting of the `result` from `float64` to `int64` using the `astype` method. This ensures that the safe casting of non-equivalent data types is handled appropriately.
