Issue Analysis:
The error is occurring when calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to cast from float64 to int64 within the safe_cast function.

The GitHub issue also provides information about the expected output and the versions of pandas and other related packages.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type when performing the mean operation on a DataFrameGroupBy object. This might be causing issues with data type casting, leading to the TypeError.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean operation on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype is handled correctly, especially when dealing with nullable integer data type, so that the type casting does not result in a TypeError.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The above corrected function is simplified and focuses on performing the aggregation based on the provided parameters without unnecessary data manipulation. This revised code aims to handle the nullable integer data type properly and ensure the correct behavior for the mean operation on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
