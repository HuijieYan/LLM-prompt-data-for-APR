The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be failing due to incorrect casting from float to int in multiple places. This is causing a TypeError due to inability to safely cast non-equivalent dtypes.

The error is being triggered specifically in cases where the function "var" is used. The failing test functions are calling the "mean", "median", and "var" functions on groups created from data with nullable integer values. In these cases, the expected result is a DataFrame containing float values, but the buggy function is trying to cast the float values to integers, which is causing the error.

To fix this issue, the buggy function should be updated to handle nullable integer values properly and preserve the float dtype when necessary. The obsereved issue and the associated error message can be resolved by ensuring that the function handles nullable integer values by allowing for the possibility that the output can be of float type.

Below is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the issue described:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other parts of the function remain the same)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (previous code)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # e.g. block.values was an IntegerArray
                result = result.astype('float64')  # Ensure result is of float type

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With the above change, the function should handle nullable integer values properly and preserve the float dtype when necessary, passing the failing test cases.
