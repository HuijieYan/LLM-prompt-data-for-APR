The bug seems to be caused by an error in the aggregation logic, particularly when a DataFrame contains NA values. This is evident from the fact that the `deleted_items` list remains empty in all cases, indicating that no items are being deleted, even when expected.

To fix the bug, a possible approach could be to review the logic for handling NA values during aggregation. One potential solution could involve explicitly handling NA values within the aggregation function, either by skipping them or replacing them with a default value.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, skipna=True
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

        # remaining code for handling the result, appending to agg_blocks, etc.
        # ...
    
    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # code for managing split blocks, resetting locs, etc.
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, the `aggregation` logic has been updated to explicitly handle NA values during aggregation, allowing for a more robust and accurate computation of aggregation results.
