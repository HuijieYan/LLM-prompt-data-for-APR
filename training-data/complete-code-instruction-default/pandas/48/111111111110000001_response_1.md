The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is attempting to cast floating-point values to integer values, which is causing a `TypeError` due to non-equivalent types. This is indicated in the error message and the failing test.

The potential error location is identified in the block where the function tries to cast the result back to the original dtype.

The cause of the bug is that the function is attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64, which is not possible.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the casting of values differently. The approach to fixing the bug would involve modifying the code to handle the float to int casting appropriately, ensuring that it does not attempt to cast non-equivalent types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[indexer == i]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the erroneous casting of float values to int and streamlined the aggregation process. The modified code should now pass the failing test without the TypeError and cast issues.
