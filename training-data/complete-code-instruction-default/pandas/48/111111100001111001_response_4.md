The bug in the given function appears to be related to the calculation and aggregation of data. The function is supposed to aggregate data based on specific parameters, but the actual outcome is not as expected.

Based on the analysis, the potential error seems to be in the calculation and handling of the result, as well as the aggregation process. The function is expected to aggregate the data based on the specified parameters such as 'how', 'numeric_only', and 'min_count', but the resulting agg_blocks and other internal variables are not as expected.

To fix the bug, the aggregation process needs to be reviewed and modified. It's important to ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly based on the provided parameters and that the output variables align with the expected values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if block.is_numeric:
            result = block._try_aggregate(how, min_count)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected code, the aggregation process has been simplified to focus on numeric data, and the aggregation is performed directly on the blocks. The resulting agg_blocks are then returned along with the data items.

This revised approach should address the issues and ensure that the function produces the expected output based on the provided input values and types.
