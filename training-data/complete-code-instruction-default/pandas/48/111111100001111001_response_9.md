Based on the provided information and the analysis of the buggy function, the issue seems to be related to the aggregation of data within the function. The function is designed to perform aggregation operations on numeric data, but it is not handling the cases where the aggregation operation fails due to non-numeric data or other exceptions.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the cases where the aggregation operation fails, and to properly handle non-numeric data or other exceptional cases.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
            # Exception handling for non-numeric data and other exceptions
            if alt is not None:
                # Call alternate aggregation function
                result = block.func(alt, axis=self.axis)
            else:
                result = no_result

        if result is not no_result and not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            # Process the result and create the aggregation block
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                    result.ravel(), dtype=block.dtype
                )
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs for the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we handle exceptions for non-numeric data and other cases where the aggregation operation may fail. We also properly process and create the aggregation block for valid results.

This should address the issues identified in the buggy function and ensure that it handles different scenarios while performing the aggregation operation.
