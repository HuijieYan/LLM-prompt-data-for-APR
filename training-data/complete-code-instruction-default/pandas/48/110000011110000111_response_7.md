The problem arises from the type casting in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which results in a TypeError when trying to cast a float64 dtype to an int64 dtype. This error occurs when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

The `_cython_agg_blocks` function performs aggregation on the DataFrameGroupBy object by using the mean, median, or var functions. When using the Int64 dtype, a TypeError occurs when trying to cast the float64 dtype to the int64 dtype.

To fix the bug, the type casting in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be adjusted to handle the nullable integer data type properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    # existing code...

    index_dtype = "int64"  # Change the index dtype to integer

    # existing code...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code...

        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values.astype(index_dtype), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # existing code...
        
    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        # existing code...

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By changing the index dtype to "int64" and using the `astype` method to explicitly cast the values to the index dtype, we ensure that the type casting is handled properly and resolves the TypeError issue.

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test cases.
