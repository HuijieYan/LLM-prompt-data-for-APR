The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing a TypeError when trying to cast float64 to int64. This error is triggered when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

The issue likely stems from the way the function is handling the data when applying the aggregate function, which is resulting in the TypeError when trying to cast float64 to int64.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the nullable integer data type (Int64) properly when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, or var.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the issue:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_float_dtype

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Check if the data contains nullable integer (Int64) dtype
    has_nullable_int = any(data.blk.dtype == 'Int64' for data.blk in data.blocks)

    if has_nullable_int and is_float_dtype(data.dtype):
        data = data.astype('float64')

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By checking for the presence of nullable integers and converting them to float64 if needed, we ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function can handle the aggregation operations properly without triggering the TypeError.

After making these changes, the function should pass the failing test without raising any TypeErrors related to casting float to int. This will also address the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
