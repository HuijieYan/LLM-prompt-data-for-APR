The potential error in the given code is the indexing issue and improper handling of `deleted_items`. The `deleted_items` are supposed to be adjusted into the `indexer` to account for the items that have been removed.

The bug is caused because the `deleted_items` are not properly handled, leading to an incorrect index for the aggregator indices. As a result, the function may return incorrect results or encounter indexing errors.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `indexer` to account for the removed items in `deleted_items`. This adjustment needs to be done before resetting the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (previous body of function)

    if deleted_items:
        # Adjust the indexer to account for the items that have been removed
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = np.array([i for i in indexer if i not in deleted])

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, after checking if there are any `deleted_items`, we create a new `indexer` array by removing the elements that were present in `deleted_items`. Then, we adjust the `mgr_locs` of `agg_blocks` using the updated `indexer`. This ensures that the removed items are properly accounted for and the indexing is correct.
