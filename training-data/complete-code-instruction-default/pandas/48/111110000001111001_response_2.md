The buggy function is attempting to run an aggregation operation on data in a DataFrame, but it appears to be encountering issues due to a combination of unsupported operations and incorrect variable handling. The function attempts to handle data manipulation with some corresponding variables, but the handling is not done properly in some cases, leading to incorrect or unexpected results.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when it tries to handle the result of the aggregation operation and create the `agg_block`. It seems that the conditions and checks for certain data types and shapes are not handled correctly, leading to issues with the manipulation and creation of the `agg_blocks`.

The bug's cause lies in the mishandling of the result of the aggregation operation and the subsequent creation of the `agg_block`. This is due to improper handling of different data types and shapes, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, proper checks and handling of different data types and shapes should be implemented to ensure the correct creation of the `agg_block`. Additionally, any unsupported operations should be appropriately handled to avoid exceptions and unexpected behavior.

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # Iterate through the blocks to aggregate data
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Perform aggregation operation based on the 'how' parameter
        result, locs = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, self.axis, min_count)

        if result is not None:
            # Create the aggregation block based on the result
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Handle split items if present
    if split_items:
        # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust the indexer to account for any deleted items
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
