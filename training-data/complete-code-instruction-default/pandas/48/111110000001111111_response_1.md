Looking at the provided information and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is occurring when performing a mean operation on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype. The error is a TypeError when calling mean, median, or std, but not when calling min, max, or first.

The issue likely stems from how the DataFrameGroupBy is handling the nullable integer data type (Int64). It seems that there may be a compatibility issue with certain aggregation methods when using nullable integers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the _cython_agg_blocks function in the DataFrameGroupBy class to handle nullable integer data type correctly, specifically when performing mean, median, and std operations.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            # Instead of getting numeric data, we specifically handle the Int64 dtype
            data = data.convert_to_int()

        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
        # ...
```

In this fix, we are ensuring that when numeric_only is True, the _get_data_to_aggregate method converts the data to handle the Int64 dtype correctly.

This should address the issue as described in the GitHub post and ensure that mean, median, and std methods work properly with the nullable integer data type.
