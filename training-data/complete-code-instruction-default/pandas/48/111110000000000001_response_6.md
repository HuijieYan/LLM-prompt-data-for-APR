1. The buggy function _cython_agg_blocks is a method of the class DataFrameGroupBy. It is responsible for applying aggregation functions to the data grouped by the DataFrameGroupBy object. The method is performing aggregation on the grouped data while handling exceptions when non-numeric or unsupported functions are encountered.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the exception handling block where it tries to perform aggregation in an alternate way when certain types of exceptions are raised. This is where the bug is most likely located, as it handles the exception cases and may not be doing so correctly.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect exception handling, particularly when calling the alternate aggregation method when the original aggregation method raises a NotImplementedError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include reviewing the exception handling logic, ensuring that the correct alternate aggregation method is called when necessary, and handling the exceptions properly to avoid unexpected behavior.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_data_to_aggregate(numeric_only=True)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except Exception as e:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = result.unstack()

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the code for handling split items, adjusting indexer, and returning the result remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The corrected code features improved exception handling, ensuring that the correct alternate aggregation method is called when necessary and correctly handling the exceptions to avoid unexpected behavior.
