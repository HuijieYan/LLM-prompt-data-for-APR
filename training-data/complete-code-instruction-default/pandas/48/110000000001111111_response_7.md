The bug in the function is likely due to an error in the calculation when calling the 'mean' method after grouping data by a column. This is in line with the error observed in the GitHub issue where calling the 'mean' method on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError. The issue states that the error does not occur when calling min, max, or first, but does occur with median and std.

Upon analyzing the function and comparing the input/output variable values with the GitHub issue, it's evident that the problem lies in the calculation of the result after grouping the data. Specifically, the error occurs when calling the 'mean' method. This points to a potential issue with the aggregation calculation for mean in the function.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to ensure that the mean calculation works properly when grouping the data. This involves checking for the data type and implementing the mean calculation accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            if block.dtype == 'Int64':
                result = block.values.mean(axis=1, skipna=True, min_count=min_count)
            else:
                result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Exception handling
            pass
        
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
        
```

In this corrected function, the mean calculation is explicitly checked for the data type (specifically 'Int64') and then the mean is calculated accordingly. This should resolve the issue with calling the 'mean' method on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError, as reported in the GitHub issue.
