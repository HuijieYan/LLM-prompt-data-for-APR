The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks`, which is part of the pandas library. The failing test is trying to apply certain aggregation functions to a DataFrame with nullable integer dtype and is causing a `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64')` error.

The issue appears to be related to the casting of float values to integer dtype. The function seems to be trying to cast float64 values to int64, which is not possible due to non-equivalent types. This is resulting in the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the conversion of float values to integer dtype properly, ensuring that non-equivalent types are not being cast.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which includes a fix for the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    data, how, alt=None, numeric_only=True, min_count=-1
):
    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []
    deleted_items = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = None

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=1))

        if result is not None:
            result = result.astype(block.dtype)  # Ensure proper dtype for the result
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function now ensures that the dtype of the result after aggregation is properly handled, preventing the casting of non-equivalent types. This should resolve the TypeError issue encountered in the failing test.
