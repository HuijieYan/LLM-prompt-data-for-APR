1. The buggy function appears to be related to the GitHub issue as it involves aggregation of data using the `mean` method after grouping, which is consistent with the error reported in the GitHub issue where calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the part where the aggregation is being performed, specifically in the `try-except` block where the `grouper.aggregate` method is called. This is where the TypeError could potentially be occurring, as reported in the GitHub issue.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during the aggregation process. The error occurs when calling mean after grouping due to the interaction between the nullable integer data type and the aggregation method.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a). Adding specific handling for nullable integer data type (`Int64`) within the aggregation logic to avoid the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.
   (b). Checking the compatibility of the aggregation method with nullable integer data types and implementing a suitable alternative if necessary.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Re-implemented the aggregation logic to handle nullable integer data type
    for block in data.blocks:
        if block.dtype == 'Int64':
            result = block.values.astype('float64').mean(axis=1, skipna=True)
        else:
            result = block.values.mean(axis=1, skipna=True)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

    # Continue as before
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, specific handling for nullable integer data type (`Int64`) has been added within the aggregation logic to avoid the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue. If the dtype of a block is 'Int64', the values are converted to 'float64' before performing the mean operation to avoid the TypeError when calling mean on a nullable integer data type.
