The potential error location within the problematic function is the improper handling of the result variable. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the results of the aggregation process and resulting in incorrect formatting of the output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the result variable is handled properly and that the aggregation process is executed correctly.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if isinstance(result, tuple) and len(result) == 2:
            result = result[0]  # Extract only the result from the tuple
        
        if result is not None:  # Check if the result is not None
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks):  # Check if agg_blocks is not empty
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the code remains same
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    # ...
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the main change is in the handling of the result variable after the aggregation process. The result variable is properly extracted from the tuple (if it exists) and then checked for `None` before creating the `agg_block`. This should ensure that the aggregation process and result handling are done correctly.
