Based on the input/output variable information provided, the bug is likely occurring because the function is not handling the Int64 dtype properly when calling the mean function. This results in a TypeError when trying to perform the operation. 

To fix the bug, I would suggest modifying the function to handle the Int64 dtype by explicitly converting it to a regular integer type before performing the mean operation. This should prevent the TypeError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    if data._is_integer_dtype() and how in ['mean', 'median', 'var', 'std']:
        data = data.astype('Int64')  # Convert Int64 dtype to regular integer type

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By explicitly converting the Int64 dtype to a regular integer type before performing the mean operation, the function should now handle the dtype properly and avoid the TypeError. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
