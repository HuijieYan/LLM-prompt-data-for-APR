The problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be incorrectly handling the conversion of values from float64 to int64, leading to a `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64')`.

The error message indicates that a safe cast is being attempted from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe', and this is failing. This is likely due to the fact that the function is not properly handling the conversion of float to int.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to properly handle the conversion of float to int. This can be done by updating the conversion logic and ensuring that safe casts from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code...

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            # Updated logic to handle safe cast from float64 to int64
            if result.dtype == 'float64' and block.dtype == 'int64':
                result = result.astype('int64')

            # Existing code...

    # Existing code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this updated code, the function should now properly handle the conversion from float to int and pass the failing test cases.
