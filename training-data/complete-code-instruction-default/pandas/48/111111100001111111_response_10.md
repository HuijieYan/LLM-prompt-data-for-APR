The issue appears to be related to the handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the `DataFrameGroupBy.mean()` function. Looking at the function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, there is a part of the code that handles the aggregation of data based on the `how` parameter, which includes 'mean', 'median', 'var', etc. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `Int64` data type specifically when calculating mean, median, and var.

The expected output of calling `df.groupby('a').mean()` should be similar to the expected output mentioned in the GitHub issue, but instead it results in a TypeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is around the section where the calculation for mean, median, and var is happening. There seems to be an error in handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in these calculations, leading to a TypeError.

To fix this issue, the handling of the nullable integer data type in the mean, median, and var calculations needs to be modified to address the TypeError. This might involve checking for NA values in the data and adjusting the calculation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Handle nullable integer data type for mean, median, and var
    if isinstance(data.values, pd.arrays.IntegerArray):
        data = data.fillna(0)  # Fill NA values with 0 for calculations

    # Rest of the code for aggregation calculations
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code checks for the specific nullable integer data type and fills any NA values with 0 before performing mean, median, or var calculations, addressing the TypeError issue identified in the GitHub report.
