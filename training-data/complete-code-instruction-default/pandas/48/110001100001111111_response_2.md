The issue is caused due to the dtype='Int64' in the DataFrame, which is causing a TypeError while calling mean after grouping. The problem arises when calling aggregate functions like mean, median, and std after grouping a DataFrame with the dtype='Int64'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _cython_agg_blocks function in the pandas/core/groupby/generic.py file.

The issue occurs when the code tries to aggregate the data from the DataFrame with dtype='Int64' using the mean function after grouping. The dtype='Int64' is causing a TypeError in the function due to the handling of nullable integer data type.

To resolve the issue, the handling of nullable integer data types needs to be adjusted in the _cython_agg_blocks function.

Here's the corrected code for the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
   
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Check if the block dtype is Int64 and cast it to float64 for aggregation
        if isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
            block = block.astype('float64')

        # Rest of the aggregation code remains the same
        # ...
```

This modification ensures that the nullable integer data type is correctly handled to avoid the TypeError when calling mean after grouping in a DataFrame with dtype='Int64'. This change ensures compatibility with aggregate functions like mean, median, and std.

By implementing this fix, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the DataFrame with dtype='Int64' should be correctly aggregated using the mean function after grouping.
