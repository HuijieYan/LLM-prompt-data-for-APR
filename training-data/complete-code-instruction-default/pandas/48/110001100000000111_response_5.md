Based on the GitHub issue and the code provided, it seems that the bug is caused by an error when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The error only occurs with certain aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

The problem is likely located in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, particularly in the section where the aggregation operation is performed. It seems that the function is not handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly when performing these specific aggregation operations.

One possible approach to fixing this bug would be to add a conditional check within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly when performing aggregation operations. This could involve converting the nullable integer data type to a regular integer data type before performing the aggregation.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        # Handle nullable integer data type for specific aggregation functions
        if str(block.dtype) == "Int64" and how in ["mean", "median", "std"]:
            block_values = block.values.astype('float64')  # Convert to regular float data type
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block_values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        # ... Existing implementation ...

    # ... Rest of the function ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, a conditional check is added to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) specifically for aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std`. If the block has `Int64` dtype and the aggregation operation is one of the problematic ones, the block values are converted to regular float data type before performing the aggregation.

This should address the bug and allow the aggregation operations to work correctly with the `Int64` data type.
