1. The buggy function "_cython_agg_blocks" is part of the class "DataFrameGroupBy" which is a subclass of "GroupBy". The function calls the method "_get_data_to_aggregate" and tries to perform aggregation operations on the data. The GitHub issue is related to calling the "mean" function after grouping using a DataFrame with 'Int64' dtype, which results in a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the part where the aggregation operations are performed on the data blocks.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the data type 'Int64' causing issues with the aggregation operations when used in the problematic function. The function "_cython_agg_blocks" is responsible for performing aggregation, and it uses the "get_numeric_data" method, which may not handle 'Int64' data type properly. This is likely resulting in the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Check for compatibility of the 'Int64' data type with the aggregation operations in the function.
   (b). Handle the 'Int64' data type as a special case within the function to avoid the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.
   (c). Implement specific handling for the 'Int64' dtype to ensure that aggregation operations can be performed without errors.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):
    # Existing other methods here...

    def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            # Ensure compatibility of 'Int64' dtype with aggregation operations
            if data._is_homogeneous_type("Int64"):
                data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
            else:
                data = data._convert(datetime=True)

        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to ensure compatibility of 'Int64' dtype with the aggregation operations. If the data type is 'Int64', specific handling is performed to ensure that aggregation operations can be performed without errors, resolving the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.
