The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing due to an attempt to cast a float array to an integer array using the `astype` method, which is not possible. This is causing a `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` error.

The bug seems to be in the section where it attempts to cast the result back to the original dtype (`result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)`), which is not handled correctly for integer arrays.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle integer arrays differently when downcasting. One approach to fix the bug is to check the dtype of the array before attempting to cast it. If the dtype is integer, then a different method such as `np.int64()` can be used to create the new array with the desired dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        # Check the dtype of the result
        if result.dtype == 'int64':
            result = result.astype('float64')  # Convert integer array to float array
            
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Continue with the rest of the function as is...
}
```

This corrected code checks the dtype of the result before any casting is attempted. If the dtype is 'int64', it converts the integer array to a float array using the `astype` method.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64')` error.
