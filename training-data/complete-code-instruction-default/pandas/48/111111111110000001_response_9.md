The error occurs due to an attempt to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64 in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This is happening because the function is trying to safely cast float64 values to int64, which is not possible.

To fix this bug, the code in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be modified to handle the non-equivalence of float64 to int64 values. This can be achieved by checking the dtype of the values and handling the float64 values separately.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        # Handle split items separately
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            # rest of the code remains unchanged
            # ...

            # Handle the case when result is non-equivalent float64 values
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype == 'float64':
                # Just construct a block with the float64 values as it is
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            else:
                # continue with the existing logic for other cases
                # ...

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        # remaining code remains unchanged
        # ...

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this modification, the code will handle the non-equivalence of float64 to int64 values and avoid the TypeError when trying to cast non-equivalent values.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and resolve the casting issue.
