The class DataFrameGroupBy from the pandas library contains the buggy function _cython_agg_blocks. The GitHub issue reports that calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError. The error is caused when calling median and std as well, but not min, max, or first.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data types (Int64) when the groupby function tries to calculate the mean, median, or standard deviation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _cython_agg_blocks function in a way that it properly handles nullable integer data types and correctly calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation.

Here's the corrected code for the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._try_coerce_results()
    
    results = self.grouper.aggregate(data, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
    
    agg_blocks, agg_items = [], []

    for key, result in results:
        if result is NotScalar:
            # The result is a DataFrame, move it directly into the new blocks.
            result.blocks[:, key] = data.blocks[:, key]
            agg_items.append(key)
            agg_blocks.append(result)
        else:
            # The result is a scalar, we need to create a new block with the same type as the original block.
            agg_block = type(data.blocks[:, key])(result, dtype=data.blocks[:, key].dtype)
            agg_items.append(key)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code utilizes the _try_coerce_results() method to coerce the results. This method will properly handle nullable integer data types and correctly handle calculating the mean, median, and standard deviation. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
