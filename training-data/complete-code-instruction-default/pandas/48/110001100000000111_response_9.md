The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. The function is responsible for aggregating numeric data within a DataFrameGroupBy object using the `mean` function. The issue raised on GitHub involves calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.

The cause of the bug is that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is not handling nullable integer data types (`Int64`) correctly when performing numeric aggregation operations. This leads to a TypeError when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be modified to handle nullable integer data types (`Int64`) appropriately when performing numeric aggregation operations. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the function correctly handles the aggregation of nullable integer data types, such as Int64, when performing operations like mean, median, and std.

Below is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the issue and handles nullable integer data types (`Int64`) correctly when performing aggregation operations:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    # Check if the data contains nullable numbers, and if so, convert them to float
    if str(data.dtypes) == "Int64":
        data = data.astype('float')

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # existing code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to verify if the data contains nullable integer (Int64) types. If the data contains nullable integer types, we are converting them to float before performing the numeric aggregation operations. This ensures that the function handles nullable integer types correctly when aggregating numeric data.

This fix will address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data types (`Int64`) appropriately when performing aggregation operations such as mean, median, and std.
