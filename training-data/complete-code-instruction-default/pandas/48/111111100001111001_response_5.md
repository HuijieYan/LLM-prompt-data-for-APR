The issue in the `cython_agg_blocks` function is that it is not handling the case where the `how` parameter is not supported, leading to a `NotImplementedError`. In this case, the function should fall back to a different approach for aggregation, but the code does not currently handle this situation properly.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to add a conditional statement to handle the `NotImplementedError` and provide an alternate approach for aggregation. This could involve calling a different function or using a different method for aggregation when the specified `how` operation is not supported.

Here's the corrected code for the `cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Unsupported aggregation function")

            # Call the alternate aggregation function
            result = alt(block.values, axis=1)

        # Rest of the function remains the same ...
```

In the corrected code, we added a conditional block to handle the `NotImplementedError` and provided an alternate approach for aggregation using the `alt` function. This should address the bug and ensure that the function properly handles unsupported aggregation functions.
