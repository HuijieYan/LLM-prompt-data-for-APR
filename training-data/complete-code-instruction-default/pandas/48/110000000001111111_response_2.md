The issue is likely due to the use of the nullable integer data type, 'Int64'. This might be causing issues when performing aggregations like mean, median, var, and std after grouping.

The probable error location within the problematic function is the handling of the nullable integer data type ('Int64') when performing aggregations.

The bug's cause seems to be related to the TypeError occurring when calling mean after grouping on a DataFrame with nullable integer dtype. This aligns with the information provided in the GitHub issue, which highlights that the error occurs with median and std as well.

To fix the bug, an approach could be to handle the nullable integer data type cases separately within the function to ensure proper aggregation calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        
    # Handle nullable integer data type separately 
    if data._data.get(dtypes='Int64') is not None:
        data = data.astype('float')  # Convert nullable integer to float for aggregations

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

The addition of the conditional check and conversion of nullable integer to float for aggregations should handle the issues related to performing aggregations on nullable integer data types.
