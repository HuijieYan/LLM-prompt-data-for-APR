The buggy function is intended to aggregate data and return a list of aggregated blocks and corresponding index. The bug is likely in the computation of the aggregated result and the handling of object-dtype blocks. It seems that the function is not properly handling the aggregation process for object-dtype blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to review the aggregation logic when dealing with object-dtype blocks and ensure that the result is appropriately handled and casted to the original dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.groupby.generic import DataFrameGroupBy
from pandas.core.dtypes.dtypes import Dtype
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import Block, BlockManager
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas.core.series import get_groupby
from pandas.core.arrays.integer import IntegerArray
from pandas.core.arrays.base import maybe_downcast_numeric
from pandas.core.errors import DataError
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas.core.dtypes.dtypes import Int64Dtype
from pandas._libs.lib import no_default
from pandas._typing import Axes


def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    # ... (previous logic remains unchanged)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_default
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            if numeric_only:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # ... (exception handling logic remains unchanged)

        if result is no_default:
            continue

        # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (remaining logic remains unchanged)
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The corrected code ensures that the result of the aggregation is appropriately handled and casted to the original dtype. This should resolve the issues observed in the buggy function.
