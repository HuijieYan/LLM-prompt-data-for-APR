The bug in the provided code seems to be in the section where the result is being calculated and added to the `agg_blocks`. The `result` is calculated from the `self.grouper.aggregate` function, but the logic for handling this result and creating the `agg_block` seems to be incorrect.

The potential error seems to lie in the logic of handling the result and creating the final `agg_block` and appending it to `agg_blocks`.

Possible approaches to fixing the bug:
1. Revisit the logic for handling the result from `self.grouper.aggregate` and ensure that it is being correctly processed.
2. Double-check the data types and shapes of the variables being used in the calculation and creation of `agg_block`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            except NotImplementedError:
                # handle NotImplementedError
                continue
            
            # process the result
            if result is not None:
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
        # current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code ensures that the result from `self.grouper.aggregate` is correctly processed and used to create the `agg_block`. It also includes handling the case where the result is `None` and raises a `DataError` if there are no numeric types to aggregate.
