The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the aggregation of data using the specified function `how`. The function is intended to perform aggregation on the data based on the specified parameters, but it seems to be returning incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly, and that the results are appropriately handled and returned.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Perform aggregation based on the specified function 'how'
    result = data._reduce(how, axis=self.axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, min_count=min_count)

    # Create block from the aggregated result
    agg_block = Block(result.values, items=data.items, ref_items=result.items)

    # Return the aggregated block and items
    return [agg_block], data.items
```

In this corrected code, we use the `_reduce` method of the `BlockManager` to perform the aggregation based on the specified `how` function. The result is then used to create a new `Block`, which is then returned along with the items.

This fixes the bug by ensuring that the aggregation is performed correctly and the results are handled appropriately.

Please note that the exact implementation may vary based on the specifics of the `BlockManager` and related classes, so it's important to test this corrected code with the relevant use cases to ensure it works as expected.
