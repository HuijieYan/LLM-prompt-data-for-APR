The given function has several issues that need to be fixed. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import Block, ExtensionBlock, FloatBlock
from pandas.core.internals.managers import BlockManager
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import DataError

class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):

    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
        # Retrieve data to aggregate
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

        def __get_result(value, data_obj, block, idx):
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(value, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            except NotImplementedError:
                return None
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(idx)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            return result

        no_result = object()
        for locs, block in data.items_iter(return_block=True, return_indexer=True):
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            result = no_result
            result = None
            result = __get_result(block.values, self.obj[block.items[locs]], block, locs)
            if result is None and alt is not None:
                # Assume we can downcast the results to float64
                alt_result = __get_result(block.values, self.obj[block.items[locs]], block, locs)
                if alt_result is not None:
                    result = alt_result

        # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This new code includes error checking and implements a helper function to perform aggregation and handle any NotImplementedError.

I have refactored the code based on the given details. However, this is just a patch and without the ability to execute tests, it can't be guaranteed that this will completely fix the issue. I'd recommend running tests and debugging if needed.
