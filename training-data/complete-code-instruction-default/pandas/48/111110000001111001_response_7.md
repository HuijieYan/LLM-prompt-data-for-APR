The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is not restructuring the output correctly, leading to incorrect results. The `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` lists are not being populated properly based on the calculations performed within the function. This is likely due to incorrect handling of the dataframe blocks and their values during the aggregation process.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly populate the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` lists based on the aggregation results for each block in the dataframe. Additionally, the code for handling split blocks and adjusting the locs in the blocks needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    agg_items = data.items
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we are iterating through each block in the dataframe and calculating the aggregation result using `self.grouper.aggregate`. The result is then used to create an `agg_block`, which is appended to the `agg_blocks` list. Additionally, the corresponding `mgr_locs` array is appended to the `new_items` list.

Finally, the function returns the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` lists as expected based on the updated logic.

This corrected version ensures that the aggregation results are properly captured and the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` lists are correctly populated based on the calculations performed within the function.
