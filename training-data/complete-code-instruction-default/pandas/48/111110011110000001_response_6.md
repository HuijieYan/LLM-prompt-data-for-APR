The problematic function is the `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The failing test is trying to apply different aggregation functions to a DataFrame with nullable integer values. The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting array values from `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe'.

The bug is caused by the casting of values from `float64` to `int64` when trying to perform aggregation operations. The failing test uses nullable integer values, and when casting to integer, it encounters problems due to non-equivalent types.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to handle the nullable integer values correctly during the aggregation operations. A possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the aggregation operations handle nullable integer values appropriately, and if casting is required, it should be done in a way that accounts for nullable values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Handle nullable integer values
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype) and pd.api.types.is_nullable(block.values):
            result = self.grouper.aggregate_nullable_integer(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        
        # Rest of the logic remains unchanged

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function should handle nullable integer values properly during aggregation operations and ensure that casting from `float64` to `int64` is done in a way that accounts for nullable values.
