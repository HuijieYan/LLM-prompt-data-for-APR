The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely caused by an issue in the aggregation logic, leading to incorrect aggregation results and unexpected `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` values.

To fix the issue, you should review the aggregation logic in the function to ensure that it correctly calculates the aggregation result for the input data. Additionally, you should verify that the manipulations of `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` are done correctly to reflect the aggregated values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
from pandas import DataFrame, Index, Block, BlockManager, DataError

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        no_result = object()
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result

        # aggregation logic
        if how in ['mean', 'median', 'var']:
            result = block.values.mean(axis=1) if how == 'mean' else block.values.median(axis=1) if how == 'median' else block.values.var(axis=1)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported aggregation method")

        if result is not no_result:
            # create a new Block with the aggregated result
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        else:
            deleted_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # adjust the indexer to account for the items we have removed
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the aggregation logic has been updated to calculate the mean, median, or variance of the block values based on the `how` parameter. The `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` are then adjusted accordingly to reflect the aggregated values and their respective locations within the data.

This corrected code should address the issues identified in the buggy function and provide the expected output based on the given input parameters and variables.
