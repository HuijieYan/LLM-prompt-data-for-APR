# The buggy function _convert_key is responsible for converting the key to a specified type as required by the index. It also checks for the type of the key and throws a ValueError if it doesn't meet the expected criteria. The issue lies in the logic used to check the type of the key and determine if it is an integer or not.

# The _convert_key function is part of the _AtIndexer class, which is a subclass of _ScalarAccessIndexer. This class is responsible for indexing operations in pandas and uses various methods to access and manipulate data.

# The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic used to check the type of the key and determine if it is an integer or not. This logic is faulty and doesn't accurately determine the type of the key.

# The cause of the bug is that the logic used to check the type of the key is incorrect. It is not accurately determining whether the key is an integer or non-integer based on the index type.

# To fix the bug, we need to update the logic used to check the type of the key and determine whether it is an integer or non-integer based on the index type. This can be done by using the isinstance() function to check if the key is an instance of the integer type.

# Corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    
    # The fixed function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
