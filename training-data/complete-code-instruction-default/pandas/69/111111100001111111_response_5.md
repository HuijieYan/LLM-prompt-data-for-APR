The issue seems to be caused by an incorrect check for whether the index is an integer or not. The function fails to handle cases where the index is a float or a non-integer type. Additionally, the function fails to handle cases where the index is a datetime or timedelta type. This results in the function raising ValueError incorrectly.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to handle different types of indices correctly. The key should be checked to see if it matches the type of the index, and appropriate errors should be raised in case of type mismatches.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not isinstance(i, type(ax[0])):  # Check if the type of the index matches the type of the key
            raise TypeError("Index type does not match key type")

    return key
```

This corrected function checks if the type of the key matches the type of the index and raises a TypeError if there is a mismatch. This will ensure that the function is able to handle different types of indices correctly and will not raise ValueError incorrectly. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
