1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test and error message, as well as the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check when `is_setter` is False. There is an issue with type checking and raising a ValueError when dealing with non-integer indexes.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexes correctly, leading to a ValueError being raised in certain cases. This issue was reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value".

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Improve the type checking and conditional logic within the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes.
   - Ensure that the function correctly handles the corner cases mentioned in the failing test and GitHub issue.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes improved type checking and conditional logic to handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly. With this correction, the failing test should pass successfully, and the issue reported in the GitHub bug should be resolved.
