The bug is located in the `_convert_key` function, which is supposed to require the keys to be the same type as the index so that it doesn't fallback. However, the function does not handle the cases properly when dealing with integer and non-integer indexes.

The error message from the failing test indicates that when indexing with an integer in an index that contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` is raised. This means that the `_convert_key` function does not correctly identify the type of the index and the key, and does not handle the scenarios correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_convert_key` function to properly handle integer and non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = pd.api.types.infer_dtype(self.obj.index)
    key_type = pd.api.types.infer_dtype(key)

    if index_type != key_type:
        raise ValueError(f"Index type {index_type} does not match key type {key_type}")

    return key
```

This updated function checks the type of the index and the key using `pd.api.types.infer_dtype()` to infer the type of the index and key. If the types do not match, it raises a `ValueError`. Otherwise, it returns the key. This ensures that the key type matches the index type, addressing the issue from the failing test and error message.
