The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function, where it is failing to handle an index that is of type `float64`. The function is currently checking if the index is an integer, but not checking if it is a float. This causes the ValueError to be raised when using `ser.at[4]` because the index `4` is a float and the function is not able to handle it properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle float indexes as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() or ax.is_floating():
            if not is_scalar(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )        
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-numeric index "
                "can only have non-numeric indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function will now check if the index is either an integer or a float. If it is, it will allow numeric indexers to be used. Otherwise, it will raise a `ValueError` indicating that only numeric indexers can be used.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.

I have also refactored the error message to make it more informative and accurate.
