The bug is occurring in the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is intended to handle the conversion of keys for indexing, and the bug is leading to failing tests related to DateTime and Float64 indexes.

The issue is occurring because the function is not handling the cases correctly where the index is a DateTime or timedelta, and the key is a float or an integer. This is causing the test cases to fail, leading to the ValueError being raised.

The failing test cases are related to `ser.at[4.0]` and `ser.at[4]`, where the function is not handling the conversion of the key correctly for the DateTime and timedelta indexes.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to handle the specific cases where the index is a DateTime or timedelta and the key is a float or an integer. The function should check the type of the index and the key, and perform the necessary conversions to ensure the correct behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
            i = ax._box_scalar(i)
        elif ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.holds_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the conversion of keys for DateTime and timedelta indexes correctly, ensuring that the failing test cases pass and the issue reported on GitHub is resolved.
