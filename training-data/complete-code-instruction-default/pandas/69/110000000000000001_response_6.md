1. The buggy function is meant to convert a key to match the type of the index. It iterates through the key and the axes of the object, performing checks along the way. However, there are several issues in the function that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error locations within the problematic function are the conditional checks for integer types and the comparison of the index with the axis.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling integer and non-integer indexers for the given axes.

4. Possible approach to fixing the bug:
   - Add proper type checking for the index and axis
   - Use correct functions or methods for comparison and validation of integer types

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we use `isinstance` to check if the axis is an instance of `pd.Int64Index` and if the indexer is an instance of `int`. This ensures that we are correctly checking the types and performing the appropriate comparisons.
