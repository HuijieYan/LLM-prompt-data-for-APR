The buggy function, `_convert_key`, is designed to convert keys based on specific conditions. However, it is currently not fully implemented and contains some errors. The potential error location within the function is in the logic that checks for integer values in the keys and axes. The function should cater to the type of the index and the type of keys being used for the conversion.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the type of the index and the type of keys when performing the conversion. This results in discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values, leading to failing test cases.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check the type of index and keys before performing any operations. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly based on the data types involved. Additionally, the function should handle both integer and non-integer indexes and keys.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The corrected and fixed function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        if any(isinstance(i, int) for i in key):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    elif isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
        if any(not isinstance(i, int) for i in key):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function first checks the type of the index (whether it's a DateTimeIndex or a TimedeltaIndex) and then compares the keys with the index type. If the index is of type DateTimeIndex, it checks if any key is an integer and raises an error if true. If the index is of type TimedeltaIndex, it checks if any key is not an integer and raises an error if true. This ensures that the function correctly handles both integer and non-integer indexes and keys, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
