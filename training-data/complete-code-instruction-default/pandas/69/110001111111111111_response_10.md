The bug in the `_convert_key` function arises from its handling of integer and non-integer indexes. The function should be able to handle both cases appropriately, but it is currently raising a ValueError when encountering a non-integer index instead of handling it correctly.

The failing tests indicate that when using `get_value` with a Float64Index, the function raises a ValueError because of the non-integer index. This is also recorded as a GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value", indicating that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check the type of index and handle integer and non-integer indexes differently as required. It should not raise a ValueError for non-integer indexes but rather handle them appropriately.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function to handle both integer and non-integer indexes appropriately is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function will be able to handle both integer and non-integer indexes appropriately and pass the failing tests. This fix also satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
