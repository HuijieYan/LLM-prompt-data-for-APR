The buggy function is `_convert_key` within the class `_AtIndexer`. The function is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index, to ensure that at based indexing works correctly. The issue mentioned on GitHub is related to corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, affecting series lookups for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the loop where the function checks if the axis is integer or not, and then checks if the key is also an integer or not. There might be an issue in the condition checks and error handling.

The bug is likely caused by a logic issue in the function `_convert_key` which is not handling the different types of indexes and keys properly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function is correctly checking the type of index and key, and raising appropriate ValueError if the types are incompatible.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, IntegerIndex) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, (DatetimeIndex, Float64Index)) and not isinstance(i, (datetime, float)):
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers for {type(ax).__name__} index"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function ensures that the keys are of the same type as the index, and raises appropriate ValueErrors if they are not compatible. This should resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub for DTI and Float64Index cases.
