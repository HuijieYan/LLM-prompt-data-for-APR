The potential error in the buggy function `_convert_key` lies in the conditional checks for integer values. The function is not properly handling the cases where the index is a float or timedelta. It incorrectly checks for integer values in the index, which leads to incorrect error handling.

The bug is caused by the function's failure to correctly handle different types of indexes such as float and timedelta, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect error messages.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle different types of indexes and ensure that the checks for integer values are appropriate for the index type.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, (pd.Float64Index, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
                if not isinstance(i, type(ax[0])):
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"At based indexing on an {type(ax[0])} index can only have {type(ax[0])} indexers"
                    )
            elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
                if not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"At based indexing on an {type(ax[0])} index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected code should now handle different types of indexes and appropriately check for integer values based on the index type. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
