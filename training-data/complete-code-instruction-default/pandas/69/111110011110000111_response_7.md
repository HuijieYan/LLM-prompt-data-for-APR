1. The `At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers` error is occurring when using the `ser.at[4]` method to access a value, indicating that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexes correctly. The failing test is related to the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file, and the GitHub issue suggests that the bug affects lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is in the logic that checks whether the index is an integer or a non-integer and then raises a ValueError accordingly.

3. The bug is caused by the logic in the `_convert_key` function not handling non-integer indexes correctly, which leads to the `ValueError` being raised. The failing test is clearly related to the `At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers` error message. The GitHub issue further confirms that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include updating the logic within the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes, ensuring that the function can handle both integer and non-integer indexes without raising a ValueError.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The corrected code updates the logic within the `_convert_key` function to use `pd.api.types.is_integer` to correctly handle both integer and non-integer indexes, resolving the bug and ensuring that the function can handle both cases without raising a ValueError. This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
