1. The buggy function _convert_key is designed to handle key conversion for indexing in a pandas DataFrame. It checks the type of the key and performs validation specific to the index type.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the validation checks for integer and non-integer indexes.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking if the index is an integer, and it's not properly handling the comparison of index type with key type.

4. To fix the bug, we need to:
   - Correctly check if the index is an integer using the is_integer() method
   - Validate the index type with the key type using the isinstance() method
   - Revise the error messages to provide clear indication of the issue

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        # check if the index is integer
        if ax.is_integer():
            # check if the key is also integer
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            # check if the key is non-integer
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "Non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
