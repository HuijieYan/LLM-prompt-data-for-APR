The bug is caused by the _convert_key function not handling non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes correctly. This causes the ValueError to be raised when looking up values in the series, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _convert_key function to handle non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes properly.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

The above corrected code handles both integer and non-integer indexers for both integer and non-integer indexes. It should resolve the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

This corrected code should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
