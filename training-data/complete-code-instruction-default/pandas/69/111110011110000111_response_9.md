The buggy function _convert_key in the class _AtIndexer has an issue with type checking for the index. It checks for integer and non-integer index types but fails to consider the case when the index is float. This causes a ValueError to be raised when using the ser.at[] method with a float index value causing the failing test.

The error message clearly states that "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers", which indicates that the function is not handling float index types properly.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that there are corner cases in the get_value method for Float64Index.

To fix the bug, the _convert_key function needs to be updated to handle float index types properly, allowing it to accept float indexers for both integer and non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() or ax.is_float():
            if not is_integer(i) and not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer or float index "
                    "can only have integer or float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) or is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer or non-float "
                    "index can only have non-integer or non-float "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function now properly handles float index types and allows float indexers for both integer and non-integer indexes. It should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
