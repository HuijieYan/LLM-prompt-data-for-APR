The function is intended to require keys to be the same type as the index. There are some issues with the logic in the for loop.

The line `for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):` is iterating over the axes of the object and the elements of the key. The comparison `if ax.is_integer():` and the subsequent value checks are causing the code to run into issues. The comparison checks if the axis is an integer, which is not what we want to do. Instead, we should be checking the type of the index.

The conditional checks should be based on the type of the index and not the values within it.

The error message indicates that the issue is with "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers", which means that the function is incorrectly checking for the integer type of the index.

A possible fix for the bug:
To fix this, we can modify the code to first check the type of the index and then based on whether it is an integer or not, perform the subsequent value checks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function should address the buggy behavior and ensure that the tests pass as expected.
