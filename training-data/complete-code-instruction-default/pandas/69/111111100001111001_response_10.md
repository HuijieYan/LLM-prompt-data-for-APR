The bug in the _convert_key function appears to be related to the comparison of key values with the index. The function is intended to check the type of the index and raise a ValueError if the key type does not match. However, the comparison is not being performed correctly, leading to the function not behaving as intended.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison logic to correctly check the type of the index and key. This may involve using the isinstance() function to check whether the key values are of the same type as the index values.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function that satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
With this correction, the _convert_key function should now correctly compare the types of the index and key values and raise a ValueError if they do not match. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.
