Based on the analysis provided, the potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_convert_key` function. The issue seems to be related to checking the type of the index and the type of the key being passed. 

The failing test is related to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError being raised when the key and index types are mismatched.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to check the type of the index and compare it with the type of the key being passed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, np.datetime64)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, np.timedelta64)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, (float, np.float64)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code addresses the type checking for different index types and ensures that the key's type matches the index type. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
