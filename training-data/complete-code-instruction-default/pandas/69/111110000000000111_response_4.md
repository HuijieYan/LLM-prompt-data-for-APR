The buggy function is part of the _AtIndexer class which is a subclass of _ScalarAccessIndexer. The GitHub issue title suggests that there are corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value, and the detailed description mentions that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop where it iterates over the axes and keys to check for the compatibility of index types. It seems that there might be a logic issue within the loop that is causing the problem.

The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect type checking and compatibility verification within the _convert_key function. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when performing series lookups on Float64Index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing the type checking and compatibility verification logic within the _convert_key function to ensure it correctly handles the different index types.
2. Implementing proper error handling and validation to prevent unexpected behavior when performing series lookups.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
        return key
```

This corrected function takes into account the index type and correctly checks for compatibility with the keys. It implements proper error handling to prevent unexpected behavior when performing series lookups, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
