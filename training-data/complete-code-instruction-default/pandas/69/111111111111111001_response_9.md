The issue with the function `_convert_key` is that it incorrectly handles the key conversion for integer and non-integer indices. This leads to a ValueError when checking for integer and non-integer indexers.

The problem arises from the way the function checks for integer and non-integer indexers. It should consider the type of the index and the type of the key being passed when checking for integer and non-integer values.

The potential error location is in the if-else statements that check for integer and non-integer indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the function to correctly handle the type of index and type of key being passed, and perform checks accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        # Check if the index type is integer or float
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64, float, np.float64)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        # Check if the index type is datetime or timedelta
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) or isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (np.datetime64, np.timedelta64)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")
    return key
```

This corrected code properly handles different index types and checks the type of the key being passed. This should fix the bug and make the function satisfy the failing tests and the expected input/output variable information.
