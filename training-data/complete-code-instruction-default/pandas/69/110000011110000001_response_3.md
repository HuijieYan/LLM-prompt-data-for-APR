The buggy function is `_convert_key`. It is being called from the `pandas/core/indexing.py` module within the `__getitem__` method. The failing test is `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` and the error message raises a `ValueError` stating "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic that checks for the type of the index and whether the key is of the same type. This is causing the ValueError to be raised when indexing with non-integer values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_convert_key` function to account for non-integer indexers when the index is non-integer. This can be achieved by removing the portion of the code that raises the ValueError and allowing arbitrary setting of non-integer indexers.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    return key
```

By making the above change, we are allowing arbitrary setting of non-integer indexers.

This updated code should resolve the ValueError raised during indexing with non-integer values, and it will pass the failing test.
