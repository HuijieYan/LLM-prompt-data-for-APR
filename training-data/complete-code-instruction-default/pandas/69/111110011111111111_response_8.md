The problem lies in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class. The function is failing to handle cases where the index is a float and the key is an integer. This is leading to a `ValueError` being raised because it doesn't allow for non-integer indexers when the index is non-integer.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is that the function is not handling cases where the index is a float and the key is an integer properly. This is resulting in test failures and the raised `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle cases where the index is a float and the key is an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    keys = list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, keys):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.is_floating():
                keys = [float(k) for k in keys]
                return keys

    return keys
```

This revised function checks for cases where the index is an integer and the key is not an integer, and vice versa. It also handles cases where the index is floating and the key is an integer by converting the key to a float before returning it.

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the GitHub issue.
