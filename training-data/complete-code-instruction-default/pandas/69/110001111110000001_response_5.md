The problem is caused by the `_convert_key` function in the 'pandas/core/indexing.py' file. The error message indicates that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This indicates that the current implementation of `_convert_key` is not handling the non-integer indexes properly. This is leading to ValueError while performing `.at[4]` or `.at[4.0]`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the non-integer indexes properly. We can do this by checking the type of the index and ensuring that the key to be set matches the index type.

To remedy the situation, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function as follows:

``` python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = type(self.obj.index)

    if isinstance(self.obj.index, (Int64Index, Float64Index)):
        for i in key:
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    elif isinstance(self.obj.index, (DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex)):
        for i in key:
            if not isinstance(i, (np.datetime64, np.timedelta64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This modified function checks the type of the index and verifies that the key to be set matches that type. This approach ensures that the function can handle different index types correctly.

After modifying the `_convert_key` function, the failing test should pass without the ValueError.

Kindly integrate the aforementioned changes into the existing code.
