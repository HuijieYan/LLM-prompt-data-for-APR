The buggy function is `_convert_key` in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file, which is used to convert keys for indexing.

The potential error location within the function is likely the loop that iterates through each axis and key, where it checks if the axis is integer and then checks if the key is integer. This logic seems to be causing issues for Float64Index cases, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The bug seems to be causing issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to review the logic within the loop and potentially add a condition specifically for Float64Index cases to handle them differently.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            continue  # Skip the checks for Float64Index
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code includes a check for the Float64Index case and skips the integer checks for this specific type of index.
