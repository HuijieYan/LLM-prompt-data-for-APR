Potential error location: The function is incorrectly handling whether the index is an integer or not, leading to incorrect type checking and value assignment for the 'i' variable. 

Bug cause: The function is not properly checking for integer indexers or non-integer indexers based on the index type, leading to errors in type checking and value assignment for the 'i' variable.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and the type of the indexers separately, and conditionally apply type checking based on the index type.
2. Ensure that the correct type checking and value assignment logic is applied for both integer and non-integer type indexes.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, float):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
The corrected code ensures proper type checking based on index type and ensures that the 'i' variable is correctly assigned based on the index type.
