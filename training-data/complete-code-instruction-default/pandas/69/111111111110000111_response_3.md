1. Analysis:
The problematic function is `_convert_key` which is part of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is used to convert keys and ensure they are of the same type as the index. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is trying to access values in a Series using `ser.at[4]`, but it's raising a ValueError related to non-integer indexers.
The GitHub issue title and detailed description suggest that there are corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value that are causing problems with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the loop where the function checks if the index is an integer and if the key is an integer. This check is causing the ValueError to be raised because it's not handling non-integer values correctly.

3. Bug's Cause:
The `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexers properly, leading to a ValueError being raised when accessing values in the Series.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to handle non-integer indexers properly. It should check the type of the key and handle non-integer cases gracefully.

5. Corrected Code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code checks if the index is non-integer and if the key is an integer, and raises a ValueError in that case. This should handle non-integer indexers properly and resolve the issue.
