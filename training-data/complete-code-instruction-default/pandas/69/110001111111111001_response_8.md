The issue in the given `_convert_key` function is that it is not handling the conversion of keys properly when dealing with integer indexes and non-integer indexes. This causes the ValueError to be raised incorrectly, leading to the failing test.

In the failing test, we are dealing with a Series with indexes of type 'float64'. The failing test checks the behavior of the indexing using both float and integer keys. However, the `_convert_key` function does not handle this case appropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the type conversion based on the index. In the case of a float index, an integer key should be treated as a float key. We should also remove the unnecessary check for integer and non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    # Check the index type
    is_float_index = all(isinstance(idx, float) for idx in self.obj.index)

    # Convert the key based on the index type
    if is_float_index:
        key = tuple(map(float, key))

    return key
```

With this correction, the fixed `_convert_key` function should handle the conversion of keys appropriately based on the index type.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
