The problematic function is `_convert_key` defined inside the class `_AtIndexer` in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. This function is supposed to require keys to be the same type as the index and handle indexing on integer and non-integer indexes. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` indicates that the `ValueError: At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers` error occurs when using the `at` method with an integer key.

The potential error is located within the `for` loop in the `_convert_key` function where it checks if the index is an integer or non-integer and then raises a `ValueError` accordingly. The code does not handle edge cases where a float index is used as an integer key.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `for` loop logic to include a check for float indexes used as an integer key.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not np.isreal(i) and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected code, we added an additional check in the `else` block to handle float indexes used as integer keys. This change should pass the failing test and doesn't impact the existing functionality.
