This bug is occurring in the _convert_key function of the _AtIndexer class in the pandas.core.indexing module. The function is not correctly handling the conversion of keys when performing at based indexing on a non-integer index.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly differentiating between integer and non-integer indexes when performing at based indexing, leading to the ValueError being raised when non-integer indexers are used.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _convert_key function to properly handle integer and non-integer indexes. It should check the type of the index and validate the key based on that type.

Here's the corrected _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (float, np.float64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function checks the type of the index and validates the key accordingly. It should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
