The problematic function `_convert_key` is causing a ValueError due to mismatched types of index and key. The function is supposed to require that the keys be the same type as the index, but it currently fails to enforce this.

The issue occurs when the function checks whether the index is an integer and then compares it to the input key. If the key is an integer and the index is not holding integers, it raises a ValueError. However, in cases where the index is a float or another non-integer type, it does not perform the corresponding type check, leading to an inaccurate comparison between the key and the index.

To fix the bug, the function should check the type of the key and compare it to the actual index type, rather than assuming all non-integer keys are of the correct type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers. Indexer {i} is of the wrong type."
            )

    return key
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle integer and non-integer keys relative to the index type, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and passing the failing test.
