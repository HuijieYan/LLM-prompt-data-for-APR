In this scenario, the bug is occurring in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index and verifying if the index is an integer or non-integer.

The error is occurring because the function is incorrectly handling the case where the index is non-integer and the key is an integer.

The problem is causing the failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py`. The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` being raised when using `ser.at[4]` with a non-integer index.

The associated GitHub issue is titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" and the detailed description mentions that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include modifying the logic inside the `_convert_key` function to properly handle cases where the index is non-integer and the key is an integer. This may involve adjusting the type checks and conditions to ensure that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected code should address the issues with the original function and pass the failing test, resolving the bug and addressing the problem mentioned in the associated GitHub issue.
