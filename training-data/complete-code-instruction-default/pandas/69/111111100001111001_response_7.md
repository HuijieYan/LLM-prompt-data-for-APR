The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly handles the input key and does not properly check if the index values match the type of the key. This results in incorrect validation and potentially leads to errors.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the input key and ensure that it matches the type of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not isinstance(i, type(ax[0])):
            raise ValueError(f"Key type {type(i)} does not match index type {type(ax[0])}")

    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function now properly validates the type of the input key against the type of the index and raises a `ValueError` if they do not match.

This corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should resolve the issues with the original buggy function.
