### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to convert the key to match the type of the index. It checks for whether the key is an integer or not and raises a ValueError if the index and key types do not match. The issue seems to be with the comparison and validation logic within the function.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that the bug is affecting the Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

### Bug Location
The potential error location within the function is the comparison logic that checks the type of the index and key.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic is not properly handling the cases where the key and index have different types. This discrepancy is leading to incorrect validation and ValueErrors being raised in situations where they should not be.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the comparison logic to handle different data types for the index and key more effectively.
2. Refactor the code to have more specific checks for different data types and handle each case accordingly.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime index can only have integer indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, (float, np.floating)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have float indexers")
    return key
```

The corrected code includes specific checks for the data types of the index and key, handling each case accordingly. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
