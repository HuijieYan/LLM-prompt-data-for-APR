The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of the class `_AtIndexer` which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. This function is responsible for converting the key into the same type as the index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic used to check if the index is an integer and if the key provided is also an integer.

The bug is causing issues with series lookups for the Float64Index case, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This is likely due to incorrect validation of the key and index types.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data type of the index and validate if the key type is compatible with the index type.
2. Handle the Float64Index case separately to ensure correct type conversion.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, datetime):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a DatetimeIndex can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```

In the corrected function, we have added checks to verify the index type and the corresponding key type. We handle the Float64Index case separately and ensure that only float indexers are allowed. Similarly, we handle the DatetimeIndex case and enforce datetime indexers. For other index types, only integer indexers are allowed. This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensures that the key type is compatible with the index type.
