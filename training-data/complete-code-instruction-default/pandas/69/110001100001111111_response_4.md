The buggy function is "_convert_key" which is used to convert the key into the appropriate format based on the specified conditions. The issue seems to be related to the type of the key and the type of the index in the Series object, leading to incorrect validation checks.

The bug seems to be located in the validation checks for the type of index and key. Specifically, the checks for whether the index is an integer or holds an integer are causing the issue.

The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect checks for the type of index and key, leading to erroneous validation results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Modify the validation checks to correctly handle the type of index and key
- Introduce separate condition checks for different types of indexes (e.g., integer index, non-integer index)
- Use isinstance() to check the type of index and key more accurately

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(ax, pd.NumericIndex) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The corrected code above should handle the different types of indexes appropriately and perform the necessary checks. It addresses the issues identified in the input/output variable information and the GitHub issue.
