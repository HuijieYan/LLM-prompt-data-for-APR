The bug in the `_convert_key` function is caused by the comparison between axis and the input key. The function incorrectly assumes that the key must match the axis index type, but this is not always true. Additionally, the function has a typo when checking if a value is an integer. Lastly, the function doesn't account for the fact that the key may already be a list, and attempting to convert it again would create issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle different types of keys and axes. The function should verify that the input key matches the axis type and properly handle the case for a setter, where it should return the list, if it's not yet a list.

The corrected function can be found below:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index or convert them to lists if a setter.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    keys = list(key) if not isinstance(key, list) else key

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, keys):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, np.datetime64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, np.timedelta64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )

    return keys
```
This corrected function ensures that the key is properly matched with the axis and handles the case of a setter correctly. It also includes type checks for both datetime and timedelta indexes, and it properly handles the case where the key is already a list. This function is expected to pass the given failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
