The bug in the `_convert_key` function is in the loop where it checks for the type of the index and the type of the key. It incorrectly uses the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods on the index axis, which do not exist. Instead, it should be using the `is_numeric` method for checking if the index is numeric. Additionally, the check for the type of the key should be done using the `is_numeric` function as well.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the loop to use the `is_numeric` method for checking if the index is numeric.
2. Use the `is_numeric` method to check if the type of the key is numeric.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_numeric():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (int, float)) and not ax.is_numeric():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
