## Identified issues:
- The buggy function `_convert_key` is not handling the cases properly when setting a key or retrieving a key for indexing.
- The function is not properly validating the type of key against the index type, leading to potential errors in the indexing process.

## Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug is the mishandling of key types and index types within the `_convert_key` function. This leads to potential errors when setting or retrieving keys for indexing, affecting the Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

## Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Validate the type of the key against the index type to ensure compatibility.
- Handle cases for setting a key differently than retrieving a key for indexing.
- Implement proper error handling and validation to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexes.

## Corrected code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # validate the type of key against the index type
        if not is_setter:
            for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
                if ax.is_integer():
                    if not isinstance(i, int):
                        raise ValueError(
                            "At based indexing on an integer index "
                            "can only have integer indexers"
                        )
                else:
                    if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                        raise ValueError(
                            "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                            "index can only have non-integer "
                            "indexers"
                        )
        return key
```

The corrected code addresses the bug by validating the type of key against the index type and handling cases for setting a key differently than retrieving a key for indexing. It also implements proper error handling and validation to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexes, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
