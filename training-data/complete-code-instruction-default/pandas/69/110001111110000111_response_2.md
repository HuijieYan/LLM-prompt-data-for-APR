The buggy function "_convert_key" is used to convert the key for indexing, but it is currently throwing a ValueError in certain cases. The failing test "test_lookups_datetimelike_values" is failing due to this ValueError, and an issue has been raised on GitHub regarding this bug.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the else block where it checks for non-integer indexes. It seems that the code is not handling non-integer indexes correctly in some cases, leading to the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for checking non-integer indexes to handle the cases more accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function "_convert_key":

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_numeric() and not is_numeric(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By modifying the condition in the else block to check for numeric indexes instead of relying solely on the "holds_integer()" method, we can handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.
