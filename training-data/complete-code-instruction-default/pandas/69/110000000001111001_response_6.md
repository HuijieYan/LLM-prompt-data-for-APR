The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle cases where the key and index have different types. It tries to compare them directly, leading to errors when the types do not match.

To fix this, we can modify the comparison logic to handle different types of keys and indices appropriately. Specifically, we need to check the type of the index and handle integer and non-integer cases differently.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This function now checks the type of the index and handles integer and non-integer cases appropriately, which should resolve the issues observed in the failing tests. The modified code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
