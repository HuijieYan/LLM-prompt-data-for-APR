Potential error location: The potential error in the function lies in the for loop where it checks for integer types in the index and indexers. There seems to be a mismatch in the logic which causes the function to not handle the Float64Index case properly.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index and it is currently not handling the Float64Index case properly.
(b). The related function `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value` are affected due to this bug, leading to issues in Series lookups for the Float64Index case.
(c). The GitHub issue indicates that the bug causes corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, leading to issues in Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic in the for loop to handle the Float64Index case properly.
2. Add specific checks for the Float64Index case to ensure that it is handled correctly.
3. Review the conditions for checking integer types and indexers to accommodate the Float64Index case.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Index) and isinstance(i, (np.floating, float)):
            if not np.issubdtype(ax.dtype, np.floating):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index "
                    "can only have floating point indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
The corrected code includes condition checks for the Float64Index case and specific checks for floating point indexers. It also ensures that integer and non-integer indexes and indexers are handled correctly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
