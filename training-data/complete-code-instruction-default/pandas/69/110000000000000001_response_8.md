1. The buggy function is intended to convert keys to match the type of the index, but it contains several issues, such as checking if a value is an integer using a non-existent function `is_integer`, and it's also missing an import for `is_integer`. Additionally, the logic inside the function is not correct.

2. The potential error location is within the logic that checks the type of the index and the key.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is using a non-existent `is_integer` function, and the logic for checking the type of index and key is flawed.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Importing the necessary function to check if a value is an integer.
   - Correcting the logic for checking the type of index and key.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    import numbers  # Import for is_integer function
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, numbers.Integral):  # Check if the index is an integer
            if not isinstance(i, numbers.Integral):  # Check if the key is also an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer-based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer keys"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, numbers.Integral) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer-based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer keys"
                )
    return key
```
