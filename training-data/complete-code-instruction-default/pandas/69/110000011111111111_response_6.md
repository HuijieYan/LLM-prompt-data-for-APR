The buggy function `_convert_key` is causing a ValueError in the failing test due to the check for integer and non-integer indexers. The function is intended to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index, but its implementation has some issues.

The error is due to the fact that the function checks whether the index contains integers or non-integers, however, it doesn't handle correctly the case when the index is of type `datetime` or `timedelta`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the cases of datetime and timedelta indexes properly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):  # Check if the index is datetime or timedelta
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):  # Check if the key is a datetime or timedelta
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index "
                    "can only have datetime or timedelta indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):  # Check if the index is integer
            if not isinstance(i, int):  # Check if the key is an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:  # For other types of index
            if isinstance(i, int):  # Check if the key is an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function checks the type of the index and key separately, ensuring that for datetime and timedelta indexes, only datetime or timedelta indexers are allowed, and for integer indexes, only integer indexers are allowed. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.

The correction also addresses the GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value". The correction ensures that the Series lookups are appropriately handled for the Float64Index case.
