The issue arises from the _convert_key function in the _AtIndexer class in the pandas/core/indexing.py file. This function is used to convert the key to the same type as the index, checking for integer and non-integer indexers. The failing test case is related to lookups on Float64Index and the error message indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexers correctly.

The bug is caused by the fact that the _convert_key function is not handling non-integer indexers properly, leading to a ValueError being raised when it shouldn't.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _convert_key function to properly handle non-integer indexers.

The possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Check the type of the index and ensure that the key matches it appropriately.
2. Handle non-integer indexers correctly based on the type of the index.
3. Update the error handling logic to only raise a ValueError when necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the _convert_key function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) or isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index can only have datetime or timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")

    return key
```

With this fix, the _convert_key function should handle different index types appropriately and ensure that the key matches the index type, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
