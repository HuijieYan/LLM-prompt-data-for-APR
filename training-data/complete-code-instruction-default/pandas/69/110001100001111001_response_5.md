The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle the case when the index of the Series is of type datetime or timedelta and the values in the key are integers. This causes the function to raise a ValueError incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check the type of the index and handle the integer values in the key accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now handle the different types of index correctly and raise an error only when necessary, satisfying all the expected input/output variable information provided.
