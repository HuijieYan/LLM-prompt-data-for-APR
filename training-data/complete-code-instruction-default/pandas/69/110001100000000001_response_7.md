# The buggy function is responsible for converting the keys to the same type as the index, and it checks whether the keys are suitable for the index. The potential error location is within the for loop where it iterates through the axes and keys. 

# The bug's cause is that the function is_integer() is being called on the axis object, which is likely not the correct function to use. Additionally, the function is_integer() is being called without referencing it correctly, and it should instead be called on the i variable.

# To fix the bug, the correct function should be used to check whether the index is an integer index or not, and the is_integer() function should be called on the i variable. Additionally, the logic inside the for loop should be corrected to handle the cases where the index is integer or non-integer type.

# Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.dtype kind.startswith('int'):
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.dtype.kind.startswith('int'):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
