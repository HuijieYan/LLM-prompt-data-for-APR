The bug in the _convert_key function lies in the loop that iterates over the axes and checks whether the index is an integer. The bug causes the function to throw a ValueError when the index is not an integer, but the key is an integer.

To fix this bug, we can update the loop to perform the type checking more accurately, based on the type of the index. Additionally, we can simplify the flow by separating the checks for is_setter and is_integer.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if isinstance(self.obj, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        if not all(isinstance(i, (int, np.int, np.int64)) for i in key):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    elif isinstance(self.obj, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
        if not all(isinstance(i, (float, np.float, np.float64)) for i in key):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )

    return key
```

This corrected code should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing test cases.
