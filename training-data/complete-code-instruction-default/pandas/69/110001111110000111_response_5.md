The issue is related to the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This function is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index, and it is used in various indexing operations like `get_value`, `loc`, and `at`.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` file is showing that there is an error related to "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" details problems with Series lookups affected for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function seems to be in the logic that checks if the index is integer or non-integer and then applies corresponding checks to the key provided.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_convert_key` function. The function should handle the different types of indexes and keys correctly, allowing non-integer keys for non-integer indexes and vice versa. We also need to ensure that it continues to work with the related functions like `get_value`, `loc`, and `at`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This updated version of the `_convert_key` function performs separate checks for integer and non-integer indexes, allowing the corresponding types of keys. It should resolve the issue reported in the failing test case and also address the problem mentioned in the GitHub issue.
