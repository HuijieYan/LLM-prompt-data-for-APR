The issue with the `_convert_key` function is that it checks whether the index axes are integer using the `ax.is_integer()` method, which is incorrect. The correct method to use is `is_integer_dtype` to check if an axis is of integer type.

Potential error location: The issue is with the line `if ax.is_integer():`. This check will always return False, as `is_integer()` is not a valid method for a pandas `Float64Index`.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function is not correctly checking whether the index axes are of an integer type.
(b). The erroneous check is based on the `is_integer()` method, which is not valid for the `Float64Index` object.
(c). This issue is causing the function to erroneously raise a `ValueError` when used in the test cases.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to replace the `ax.is_integer()` with `is_integer_dtype(ax)`. By doing so, we can correctly identify if the axis of the index is of integer type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_integer_dtype(ax):
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

By replacing `ax.is_integer()` with `is_integer_dtype(ax)`, we can correctly identify if the axis of the index is of an integer type.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
