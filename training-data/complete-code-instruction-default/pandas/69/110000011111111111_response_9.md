The bug is caused by the _convert_key function. The function is supposed to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index, but it is raising ValueError in some cases.

The failing test is related to Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

The issue is occurring because the _convert_key function is incorrectly raising a ValueError in some specific cases, causing the failing tests to not pass.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _convert_key function so that it correctly handles the different types of keys and indexes, and does not raise unnecessary ValueErrors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers")
        elif not isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)) and not isinstance(i, (int, float, np.int64, np.float64)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")

    return key
```

This modified function includes specific checks for different types of indexes and keys, ensuring that the correct type of indexer is used for each index type. It also removes the unnecessary checks and resolves the ValueError issues.

With this corrected code, the failing tests should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
