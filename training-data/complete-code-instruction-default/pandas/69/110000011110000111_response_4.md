The buggy function is `_convert_key` and it is being triggered in the failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values`. The error message indicates that when using `ser.at[4]` it raises a `ValueError` due to non-integer index having non-integer indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexes properly, resulting in the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes. We can do this by checking the dtype of the index and converting the key to the same type as the index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_dtype = self.obj.index.dtype
    if index_dtype.kind in ['i', 'u', 'f']:
        key = np.array(key, dtype=index_dtype)
    return key
```

This corrected code checks the dtype of the index and then converts the key to the same type as the index. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass. The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" can be closed once this fix is implemented.
