The issue seems to be related to the handling of different data types in the `key` parameter and the `self.obj` index when the `is_setter` parameter is False. The function is supposed to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index in order to avoid fallback.

The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the logic that checks the data type of the elements in the key compared to the index elements.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the different data types in the key and the index, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the different data types and ensure that the keys match the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index "
                    "can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index"
                    "can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Unsupported index type"
            )
    return key
```

The corrected function now properly checks the type of the index and the keys, and raises appropriate ValueError exceptions if the data types do not match as expected. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
