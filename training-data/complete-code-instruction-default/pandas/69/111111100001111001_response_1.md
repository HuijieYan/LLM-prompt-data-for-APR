The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where the index is of a different type than the key. This causes the function to not return the correct type of variable when the key has the same type as the index.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check the type of the index and cast the key to that type if they are different. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the is_setter parameter is True and return the key as a list in that case.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    index_type = type(self.obj.index)
    key_type = type(key)

    if index_type != key_type:
        key = index_type(key)

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function should now handle cases where the key and index have different types, and also properly handle the case where is_setter is True.
