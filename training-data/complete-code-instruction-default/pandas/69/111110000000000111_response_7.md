The potential error location within the problematic function is in the loop that iterates through the axes of the object and checks the type of the index.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect comparison of index types, causing issues with series lookups for the Float64Index case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to properly handle the different index types.
2. Add additional checks to ensure that the indexers are of the correct type.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This fixed function should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and handle the comparison of index types correctly, ensuring that series lookups are not affected for the Float64Index case.
