Potential error location:
The potential error in the function is the comparison of the index type and the key type. There are also issues with checking if the index is an integer and the key is also an integer.

Bug's cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of index and key types, as well as the improper handling of integer indexes and non-integer indexes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and the key separately, and compare them to ensure they are compatible.
2. Properly handle integer and non-integer indexes and keys.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code properly checks the type of the index and the key, and compares them to ensure they are compatible. It also handles integer and non-integer indexes and keys appropriately. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
