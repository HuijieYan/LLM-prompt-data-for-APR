In the buggy function `_convert_key`, the issue appears to be in the condition for checking if the index is integer or non-integer. The function is not handling the cases where the key and axis are both float or integer.

The failing test and error messages indicate that the issue is related to the conversion of keys in the `Float64Index` case, causing an error when trying to get the value.

The expected input/output variable information provided reflects the discrepancy between the current behavior and the expected behavior for the function `_convert_key` in handling integer and non-integer index and key values.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" describes the corner cases in DateTimeIndex (DTI) and Float64Index get_value, indicating that there are issues with specific cases that need to be addressed.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to handle the cases where the key and axis are both float or integer, and to accurately check for integer and non-integer index and key values.

Here's the corrected code for the function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
      fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
  
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        # check if the axis and key are both float or integer
        if ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, (float, int)) and not isinstance(i, bool):
            continue
        elif not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (float, int)):
            continue
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on an {'integer' if ax.is_integer() else 'non-integer'} index "
                f"can only have {'integer' if ax.is_integer() else 'non-integer'} indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code handles the cases where the key and axis are both float or integer appropriately, and accurately checks for integer and non-integer index and key values. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
