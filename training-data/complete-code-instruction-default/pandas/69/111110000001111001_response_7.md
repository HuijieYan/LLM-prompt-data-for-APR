Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue with the `_convert_key` function is that it does not handle non-integer indexers correctly. The function should check for non-integer indexers and raise a ValueError in those cases.

To fix the bug, the _convert_key function should be updated as follows:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    # Fix for the buggy function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this update, the _convert_key function correctly checks for non-integer indexers and raises a ValueError in those cases. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in all the provided test cases.
