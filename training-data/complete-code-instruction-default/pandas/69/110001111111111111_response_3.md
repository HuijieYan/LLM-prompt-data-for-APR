The issue arises from the _convert_key function within the pandas/core/indexing.py file. This function is used to convert the input key into a format that matches the index of the DataFrame. The failing test in the pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py file is related to datetime-like and timedelta-like values and their lookup in the DataFrame. The issue seems to be with the conversion and comparison of integer and non-integer index values.

The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling the conversion and comparison of integer and non-integer index values correctly. The error message also shows that the ValueError is raised when the function encounters a non-integer index.

Based on the failing tests and the error message, it appears that the _convert_key function is not properly handling the comparison of integer and non-integer index values, which causes the failing tests and the raised ValueError.

To fix this issue, the _convert_key function needs to be modified to properly handle the comparison of integer and non-integer index values. This can be achieved by checking the type of the index and the input key, and then performing the comparison accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta, pd.Period)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Datetime based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime-like indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, pd.Period)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Timedelta based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta-like indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not isinstance(i, (float, np.floating)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This modified code checks the type of the index and the input key, and then performs the comparison accordingly. It handles datetime-like values for DatetimeIndex and timedelta-like values for TimedeltaIndex, and also properly checks for integer and non-integer values.

With this corrected code, the failing tests should pass, and the issue reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
