The bug is caused by the `_convert_key` function not correctly handling the conversion of keys in certain cases, resulting in a ValueError being raised when using `.at[]` to access elements in the Series. This issue affects the lookups for both `Float64Index` and `DatetimeIndex`, as evidenced by the failing tests and error messages provided.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to handle different types of index values correctly. The function should check the type of the index and the type of the key and raise a ValueError if the types do not match as per the expectations.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to check the type of the index and key using `isinstance` and then handle the conversion accordingly. If the index is of type `Float64Index` and the key is not a float, or if the index is of type `DatetimeIndex` and the key is not a datetime, then the function should raise a ValueError.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a Float64 index can only have float indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a Datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected function, the failing tests should pass, and the bug should be resolved. This fix should also address the issue reported on GitHub regarding corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.
