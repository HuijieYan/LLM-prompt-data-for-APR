The issue with the current function is that it's not handling the types of index and key properly. It's assuming that the index is always a Float64Index, which is not the case. We need to check the type of the index and key and handle them accordingly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check the type of the index and key, and based on that, perform the necessary validation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, str)):
            raise ValueError("DatetimeIndex can only have datetime indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, np.timedelta64)):
            raise ValueError("TimedeltaIndex can only have timedelta indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
            raise ValueError("Int64Index can only have integer indexers")

    return key
```

This corrected function now checks the type of the index and key using `isinstance` and performs the necessary validation. It is updated to handle different types of indexes and corresponding key types. This should fix the bug and satisfy all the provided test cases.
