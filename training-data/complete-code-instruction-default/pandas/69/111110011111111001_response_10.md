The issue in the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where the index is of type float but the key is of type int correctly. This is causing the ValueError to be raised in the failing tests. The function is not correctly determining if the key is an integer or not for the float index.

To fix the bug, we need to check the type of the key and convert it to float if it is an integer when the index is of type float. This will ensure that the key and index have matching types.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if isinstance(key, int) and isinstance(self.obj, pd.Float64Index):
        key = float(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code will handle the type conversion of the key from int to float when necessary, and properly handle the integer and non-integer index cases.

This fix should resolve the failing test cases and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
