The potential error location within the problematic function is in the inner if-else block where it checks for the type of the index (integer or non-integer). The bug causes the function to incorrectly validate the type of the index when it should be validating the type of the key.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the if-else block to correctly validate the type of the key based on the type of the index. Additionally, we should use the built-in isinstance function to check if the key is an integer, instead of the undefined is_integer function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the faulty function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, IntegerIndex):
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, IntegerIndex):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
In the corrected code, we have replaced the undefined function is_integer with the correct function isinstance to check the type of the index. We have also used isinstance to check the type of the key and return the corrected key based on the type of the index.
