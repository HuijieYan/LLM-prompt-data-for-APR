The issue seems to be related to the handling of different data types in the input "key" and the "self.obj.axes" in the function. It looks like the function is not correctly handling cases where the index and the key have different data types. This is causing the function to raise a ValueError in some cases.

The potential error location within the function is the for loop where it compares the data types of the index and the key. It is not handling the cases of different data types correctly.

The bug's cause can be identified as the function's inability to handle cases where the data types of the index and the key are different, resulting in a ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle different data types of the index and the key appropriately. It should also check for the data type of the key and the index before comparing them.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")

    return key
```

This corrected function takes into account the data type of the index and the key and compares them appropriately. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
