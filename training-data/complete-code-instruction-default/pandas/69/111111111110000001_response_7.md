The failing test is related to the function `_convert_key` in the `_AtIndexer` class in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` being raised in the `_convert_key` function when using `.at[4]`. The failing test is trying to access the value at position 4 using `ser.at[4]`, and this is where the `ValueError` is being raised.

The cause of the bug is in the `_convert_key` function. It is not handling the case when `is_setter` is False and `ax.is_integer()` is False. In this case, it's throwing a `ValueError` without the correct validation check.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes when `is_setter` is False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
With this corrected code, the function will now properly handle the case when `is_setter` is False and `ax.is_integer()` is False, and the failing test should pass without any `ValueError` being raised.
