The problematic function `_convert_key` takes a key and determines whether it is suitable for indexing based on certain criteria. The key should match the type of the index and be an integer if the index is an integer. If the index is not an integer, the key must not be an integer.

The bug occurs in the implementation of the logic to check if the key is suitable for indexing. The current logic does not cover all possible cases of different index types and corresponding keys which can lead to a `ValueError`. The function also does not handle the case when is_setter is True.

To fix the bug:
- We need to handle the case when `is_setter` is `True` by returning the list of keys.
- We need to have separate logic for integer and non-integer indexes and appropriately handle the keys based on their types.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code handles both cases where the index is an integer or non-integer and appropriately checks the keys to ensure that they are suitable for indexing based on the type of index. The case where `is_setter` is `True` is also handled by returning the list of keys.
