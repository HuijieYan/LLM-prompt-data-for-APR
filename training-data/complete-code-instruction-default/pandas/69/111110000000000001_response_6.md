Potential error location: The function is_setter is not being handled properly, and there is a typo in the function name "is_integer" which should be "ax.is_integer".

Bug's cause:
The buggy function "_convert_key" is not handling the is_setter condition properly and there is a typo in the function name "is_integer". This is causing the function to not properly identify the type of the index and not handle the setter condition correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the function to handle the is_setter condition properly.
2. Fix the typo "is_integer" to "ax.is_integer".

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):




    # The corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return key.tolist()
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
