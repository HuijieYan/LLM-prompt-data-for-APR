Potential error location: 
The error seems to be in the loop that iterates through the object axes and checks if the index is integer or not.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` functions. These functions are not defined in the given code snippet, but it is likely that they are meant to check if the index is of integer type. Additionally, there are some logical inconsistencies in the conditions for raising `ValueError`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct functions to check if the index is of integer type.
2. Revise the conditions for raising `ValueError` to ensure that they accurately reflect the requirements for integer and non-integer indexes.

Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code uses `isinstance()` to check if the index is of type `pd.Int64Index` and if the key is of type `int`. The conditions for raising `ValueError` have been revised to accurately reflect the requirements for integer and non-integer indexes. Additionally, the code now returns `key` at the end.
