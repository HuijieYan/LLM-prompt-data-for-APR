The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to convert keys and validate them based on certain conditions. The failing test is related to `get_value` method and it's failing due to an error in the `_convert_key` function. The error message indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexers correctly.

The GitHub issue mentions corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, which indicates that there might be specific edge cases not handled properly in these methods.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it checks for integer and non-integer indexers. It seems that the function is not handling non-integer indexers correctly.

To fix the bug, the function `_convert_key` needs to be modified to handle non-integer indexers properly. It should check for the type of indexers and validate them according to the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function should now handle non-integer indexers properly and pass the failing test. Additionally, it resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post.
