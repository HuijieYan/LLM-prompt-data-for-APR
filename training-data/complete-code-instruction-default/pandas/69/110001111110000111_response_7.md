The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting keys and checking their types based on the index. The error message indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexes correctly.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is testing various lookups on a `float64` index. The specific error is raised when using the `at` method to access a value with a non-integer index.

The GitHub issue title and description indicate that this bug is related to corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value, and that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to correctly handle non-integer indexes by allowing non-integer indexers when the index is non-integer.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer() and pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this fix, the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods are replaced with the `pd.api.types.is_integer` method, and the conditions are adjusted to correctly handle non-integer indexes.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
