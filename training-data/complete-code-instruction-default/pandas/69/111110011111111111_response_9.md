The issue lies within the `_convert_key` function within the `_AtIndexer` class. The function is failing to correctly handle integer and non-integer indexes and indexers, leading to the ValueError being raised.

After analyzing the function, class, failing test, and error message, as well as the expected input/output variable information and GitHub issue, it can be concluded that the bug is occurring due to incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indexes and indexers in the `_convert_key` function.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to correctly handle integer and non-integer indexes and indexers. This can be achieved by checking the type of the index and indexer and raising the ValueError only when they don't match.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) or isinstance(i, float):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected function should now handle integer and non-integer indexes and indexers correctly, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
