The potential error in the _convert_key function lies in the block of code that checks the type of the index and the type of the key. It seems to be incorrectly handling the case where the index is of type Float64Index and the key is either a float or an integer. This is causing the function to raise a ValueError even when the key is of the same type as the index.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case where the index is a Float64Index. This is leading to incorrect type checks and ValueError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the type checking logic to properly handle the case where the index is of type Float64Index and the key is either a float or an integer. We also need to ensure that the function handles the case where the index is of type TimedeltaIndex in the same way.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, (Float64Index, TimedeltaIndex)):
                if not isinstance(i, (float, int)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a float or timedelta index "
                        "can only have float or integer indexers"
                    )
            elif ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
        return key
```
This corrected code handles the case where the index is of type Float64Index or TimedeltaIndex and ensures that the key is of the correct type. It also takes care of the cases where the index is of type Int64Index. This code should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
