Potential Error Location:

The potential error in the problematic function lies in the loop that iterates through the axes and keys to check if the index type matches the expected type. If the conditions defined within the loop are not met, a ValueError is raised.

Bug's Cause:

The bug occurs due to the mismatch in index type and the key type. The code does not handle non-integer index for an at-based indexing operation, resulting in a ValueError being raised.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the condition checks in the loop to handle non-integer index for at-based indexing. This can be achieved by distinguishing between integer and non-integer indexes and setting the conditions accordingly.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fall back)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
The issue was resolved by using the `pd.api.types.is_integer()` method to check for integer or non-integer types and setting the conditions based on the index type. Additionally, the error messages have been updated to provide a more descriptive explanation of the issue.
