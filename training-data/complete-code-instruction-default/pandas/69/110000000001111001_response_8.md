The issue with the current implementation is that it is not handling the case where the key is a float value for integer index and vice versa correctly. This is resulting in incorrect type checks and hence the function failing to return the expected values.

To fix this, we need to modify the code to handle these cases separately and perform the type checks with correct conditions.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.index, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
