The issue with the buggy function `_convert_key` is that it is not handling date or timedelta indices correctly. The error message indicates that there is a problem when the function is running for non-integer indices. This is indicated by the presence of the `index can only have non-integer indexers` message in the error message, and the `ax.holds_integer()` check in the buggy function.

The resolution to this problem is to remove the check for integer indices altogether. Since indices can be of different types, they should be handled independently without relying on the `holds_integer()` function.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Requires the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if type(i) != type(ax[0]):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an index can only have indexers of the same type"
            )
    return key
```

This fix removes the check for integer indices and instead uses the `type(i) != type(ax[0])` to compare the types of the index and the key. This should ensure that the function handles different index types correctly. Additionally, this corrected code should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
