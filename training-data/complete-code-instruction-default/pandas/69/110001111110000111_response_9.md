The buggy function `_convert_key` is causing an error due to incorrect handling of non-integer indexes. The function is meant to convert the key based on the index type, but it does not handle non-integer indexes correctly, leading to a ValueError.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is testing the behavior of indexing and value retrieval using various methods, including `index.get_value`, `ser.at`, `ser.loc`, etc. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError raised in the `_convert_key` function at `pandas/core/indexing.py:2128`.

From the GitHub issue description, it is clear that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes and ensure that the key is converted in accordance with the index type.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check the type of the index in the `_convert_key` function and handle integer and non-integer indexes separately. We should also ensure that the key is correctly converted to match the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Int64Index):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index " "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer " "index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should handle integer and non-integer indexes correctly and pass the failing test. Additionally, it addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
