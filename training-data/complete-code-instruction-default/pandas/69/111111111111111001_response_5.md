The issue in the _convert_key method seems to be related to the comparison of the type of the index and the type of the key. It appears that the method is not correctly handling the comparison of integer and non-integer values which is causing the ValueError to be raised in the failing test case. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _convert_key method to correctly handle the comparison of integer and non-integer values to prevent the ValueError from being raised. We also need to ensure that the method appropriately handles the input types and value, in relation to the index type.

Here is the corrected version of the _convert_key method:

```python
# The corrected code for the buggy function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64, np.int32)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, (float, np.float64, np.float32)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In this corrected version, we have specifically checked for the type of the index (either pd.DatetimeIndex or pd.TimedeltaIndex) and the type of the key. Based on the type of the index, we make a comparison with the type of the key to ensure that the correct type of key is being used for indexing.

This corrected version should resolve the ValueError being raised in the failing test cases and ensure that the method handles the input types and values as expected.
