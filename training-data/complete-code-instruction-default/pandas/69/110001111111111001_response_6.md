The issue in the provided code is due to the type check for index values. The function relies on the type of elements in the key to match the index type, which does not handle float and integer type conversion for datetime-like and timedelta-like indexes properly.

The error message indicates that the problem is occurring at the line:
```python
if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
```
This is likely the point at which the type of the index element in comparison with the type of the key element is causing the failure.

To fix this issue, we need to update the function to properly handle the comparison of index types with key types for datetime-like and timedelta-like indexes.

A possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to check for the possible conversions of the key to match the type of the index.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            if isinstance(i, (float, int)):
                i = ax._maybe_cast_indexer(i)
                if i is None:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"At based indexing on a {ax._safe_type_of_index}"
                        " index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            elif isinstance(i, (str, bytes)):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based string-likes has set it's requirement on its index"
                )
            continue

        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected function now includes additional checks to handle the conversion of the key to the appropriate type based on the index type. This should address the issue and allow the function to correctly deal with different types of indexes.
