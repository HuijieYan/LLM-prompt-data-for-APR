The buggy function `_convert_key` is related to the failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in the test file `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py`. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised in the function `_convert_key` in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`.

The issue is in the for loop within the function, where it is checking if the axis is an integer, but the condition `ax.is_integer()` should be `ax.is_integer()` instead. The condition `if is_integer(i)` should be replaced by `if isinstance(i, int)` . This will ensure that the correct type checking is performed and ValueError is not raised incorrectly.

The correct code for the problematic function `_convert_key` is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
