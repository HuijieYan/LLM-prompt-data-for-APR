The buggy function `_convert_key` in the class `_AtIndexer` in `pandas/core/indexing.py` is causing an error due to an incorrect condition check. The function is intended to convert the keys to be the same type as the index, but it is not handling the non-integer index correctly, causing a `ValueError` in certain cases.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` is failing with a `ValueError` due to the bug in the `_convert_key` function, as seen in the error message. The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" highlights the problem with Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, the condition check in the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to handle non-integer indexes correctly. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the keys to be the same type as the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass. The corrected function now handles non-integer indexes correctly as per the expected behavior, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
