The problematic function '_convert_key' is used to ensure that the keys match the type of the index in the class '_AtIndexer'. It has multiple checks to validate the type of the key indexes and raise a ValueError if the key indexes do not match with the type of the index. However, the error occurs when the key indexes are non-integer and a check fails to raise a ValueError. This causes the failing test as shown in the error message.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the '_convert_key' function to correctly handle the case when the key indexes are non-integer.

The corrected code for the problematic function '_convert_key' is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:  
            # Updated check for non-integer indexes
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected function now includes an updated check for non-integer indexes in the 'else' block, where it raises a ValueError if the index is non-integer. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.
