The bug in the `_convert_key` function occurs due to the incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indices in the input key. The function is raising a `ValueError` when it encounters a non-integer index with an integer key, which is not appropriate.

The bug is caused by the incorrect logic for validating integer and non-integer keys against the index type. This leads to the failing test as the function does not handle the cases for datetime/timedelta index correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `_convert_key` function to handle different index types appropriately, allowing for arbitrary setting and ensuring that integer and non-integer keys are handled correctly for different index types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to match the type of the index, allowing arbitrary setting.
    """
    idx_type = type(self.obj.index)
    
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    if idx_type in (pd.Float64Index, pd.Int64Index):
        return key
    
    for i in key:
        if not isinstance(i, idx_type.dtype.type):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid index type: {type(i)}, expected: {idx_type.dtype.type}")

    return key
```

This updated function first checks the type of the index and then handles the key conversion accordingly. For `Float64Index` and `Int64Index`, the key is directly returned. For other types of indices, it validates each element of the key against the index type and raises a `ValueError` if the types do not match.

With this correction, the function should now handle integer and non-integer keys correctly for different index types, and it should pass the failing test case. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to corner cases in `DTI.get_value`, `Float64Index.get_value`.
