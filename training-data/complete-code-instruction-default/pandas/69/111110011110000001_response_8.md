The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is raising a `ValueError` with the message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This error is caused by the `_convert_key` method in the `_AtIndexer` class, which is attempting to perform some index conversion based on the type of the index and the provided key. The error arises from the check for whether the index is an integer and then verifying that the key is of the correct type. The failing test is using `ser.at[4]`, which is calling the `_convert_key` method with a key of `(4,)`, and it's failing the check for non-integer indexers.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `_convert_key` method to handle the case where the index is not an integer type by not performing the check for non-integer indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected method avoids checking for non-integer indexers when the index is not of integer type and will resolve the `ValueError` issue encountered in the failing test.
