The problem lies in the `_convert_key` function within the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. When handling non-integer indexes, the function should be able to receive non-integer indexers.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the `_convert_key` function not allowing for non-integer indexers when the index itself is non-integer. This results in a `ValueError` being raised as shown in the failing test message.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function should be updated to allow for non-integer indexers when the index is non-integer. This involves modifying the logic to check for the index type and appropriately handle integer and non-integer scenarios. Additionally, it can also be beneficial to thoroughly review related functions and tests to ensure that the behavior is consistent and correct.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test passes as expected.
