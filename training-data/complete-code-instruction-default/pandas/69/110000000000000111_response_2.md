The problematic function `_convert_key` is used to convert keys based on certain conditions, such as if it is a setter or not, and checks if the key is the same type as the index. The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" specifically mentions that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which means that the bug is related to the indexing of the data type Float64Index.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the conditional checks for integer and non-integer indexes. It is likely that the conditionals are not accurately identifying the type of the index which may be causing the bug to occur.

The bug's cause is likely due to the conditional checks within the function not accurately identifying whether the index is an integer or non-integer. This is leading to errors when cases related to Float64Index are handled.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to revisit the conditional checks for identifying the index type and make sure they accurately distinguish between integer and non-integer indexes, especially when dealing with Float64Index.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, float) and not isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-Float64Index "
                    "index can only have non-float "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, the conditional checks have been revised to accurately identify the index type, especially when dealing with Float64Index. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
