Explanation:
1. The buggy function `_convert_key` was not handling the cases properly which caused issues with series lookups for the `Float64Index` case. This was reported as a bug on GitHub with the title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value".
2. The potential error location within the problematic function was identified in the if-else condition where it was not properly handling the key types.
3. (a). The buggy function `_convert_key` was responsible for converting keys based on the index type.
   (b). The buggy class `_AtIndexer` was a part of the class hierarchy where the function was used to convert keys for indexing.
   (c). The GitHub issue specified that series lookups were affected for the `Float64Index` case, indicating that the bug was related to incorrect key conversion.
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the type of index and key to ensure consistency
   - Handling different index types and key types appropriately
   - Raising ValueError for invalid combinations of index and key types
5. The corrected code for the problematic function has been provided above. The changes include:
   - Checking the type of the index using `isinstance` instead of `ax.is_integer()`
   - Using `isinstance` to check the type of the key and index to ensure consistency
   - Raising `ValueError` for invalid combinations of index and key types to handle the cases properly.
