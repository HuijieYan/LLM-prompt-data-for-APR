The buggy function in question is the `_convert_key` function from the `_AtIndexer` class in the pandas module. This function is responsible for converting keys to be the same type as the index, and it is used in the context of at-based indexing on a non-integer index with non-integer indexers. The failing test is related to Series lookups affected for the Float64Index case.

The error message points to the line in the `_convert_key` function where it raises a ValueError when encountering a non-integer index with an integer indexer. This is likely the location of the bug, as the error message indicates that the function is incorrectly handling this situation.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" specifies that there are corner cases in the `get_value` method for Float64Index, and this aligns with the failing test that demonstrates issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle at-based indexing on a non-integer index with non-integer indexers. This may involve updating the logic for checking index types and indexers types to ensure they are compatible.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function would be:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated function includes the use of `pd.api.types.is_integer` and `pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype` to properly check for integer types and compatibility, and it ensures that the function will work as expected for the scenarios described in the failing test and GitHub issue.
