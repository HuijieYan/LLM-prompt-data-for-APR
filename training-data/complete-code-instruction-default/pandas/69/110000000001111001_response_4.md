The bug is occurring because the function does not properly handle cases where the key is not an integer type as expected or where the axis is not of the same type as the key. This can lead to a mismatch between the key and the axis, resulting in errors.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to properly handle cases where the key and axis do not match in type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        if not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
            key = [key]
        return key

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer() and (isinstance(i, (int, np.int64))):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle different types of keys and axes, and not produce any errors as described in the failing test cases.
