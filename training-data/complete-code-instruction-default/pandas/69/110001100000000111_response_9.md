# The issue with the buggy function is that it fails to properly handle integer and non-integer indexes in the key when setting values, leading to unexpected behavior in Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop that iterates through the object's axes and checks the type and integer status of the key. This is where the issue arises as it fails to properly differentiate between integer and non-integer indexes.

The cause of the bug:
(a). The buggy function does not accurately validate the type of index and key, leading to improper handling of integer and non-integer indexes.
(b). The related functions in the pandas library that use this `_convert_key` function rely on it to ensure proper indexing behavior, hence leading to unexpected behavior in Series lookups for the Float64Index case.
(c). The GitHub issue information highlights that the bug affects DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value, indicating that Series lookups are impacted for the Float64Index case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic to accurately check for integer and non-integer indexes, ensuring proper validation of the key when setting values.
2. Implement conditional statements to handle different index types and their corresponding keys.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code utilizes `isinstance` to properly check for integer and non-integer index types and `np.issubdtype` to validate the key's type, ensuring proper handling of different index and key combinations, effectively resolving the issue identified in the GitHub report.
