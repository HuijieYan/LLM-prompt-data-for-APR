The buggy function in the code is `_convert_key`. The error message states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers." This indicates that the issue lies within the conversion of the key for indexing.

The failing test is related to lookups on a Float64Index and the conversion of the key for indexing. It is failing because the current implementation of `_convert_key` is not handling the conversion properly for non-integer indexes.

The failing test clearly specifies the inputs and expected outputs. The failing tests demonstrate that when attempting to perform lookups using both integer and non-integer keys, the function fails to handle the conversion of the key properly for non-integer indexes.

The GitHub issue provides a title and a detailed description, indicating that there are corner cases specifically related to DTI (DatetimeIndex) and Float64Index, affecting Series lookups. This aligns with the failing test and error message.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to properly handle the conversion of the key based on the type of index. When the index is non-integer, integer keys should be cast to non-integer keys, and vice versa. This will ensure that the key type matches the index type.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                return key.astype(ax.dtype)  # Cast the integer key to the dtype of the index
            if not ax.holds_integer():
                return key.astype(ax.dtype)  # Cast the non-integer key to the dtype of the index
    return key
```

The corrected `_convert_key` function now properly handles the conversion of the key. It first checks if the index is integer or non-integer, and then casts the key accordingly to match the index type. This ensures that the key type matches the index type, resolving the failing test and addressing the GitHub issue.
