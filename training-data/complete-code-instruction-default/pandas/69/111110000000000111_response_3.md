1. The problematic function `_convert_key` is a part of the class `_AtIndexer`, which is related to the issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value". The function is utilized for converting keys and setting values, and the bug affects series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function `_convert_key` is the logic that checks whether the index type matches the key type. This logic seems to have issues that result in incorrect behavior when performing series lookups.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The problematic function `_convert_key` contains logic to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index, but the current implementation seems to have issues handling this correctly.
   (b). The class `_AtIndexer` includes the function `_convert_key` and is related to the issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value". This suggests that the issue is specific to the behavior of this class and its function.
   (c). The GitHub issue information indicates that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which further confirms that the problem lies within the `_AtIndexer` class and its function `_convert_key`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review and revise the logic in the `_convert_key` function to ensure that the index and key types are handled correctly.
   - Update the error handling mechanisms to properly address cases where the index type and key type do not match.
   - Test the function extensively with various input scenarios to identify and address any edge cases that may not be handled properly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be of the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        converted_key = list(key)
    else:
        converted_key = []
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            converted_key.append(i)
    return converted_key
```
This corrected code addresses the issues within the `_convert_key` function by properly handling the logic for key conversion and type checking. It also includes updated error handling to ensure that the index and key types are handled correctly.
