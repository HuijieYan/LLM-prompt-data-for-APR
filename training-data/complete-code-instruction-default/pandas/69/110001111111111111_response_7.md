The buggy function `_convert_key` is designed to handle different types of keys based on the type of the index and whether it is a setter. The cases used for testing the function are failing due to an error in the function's logic. The function incorrectly checks whether the key is an integer or not, without considering that the index may contain float values.

Based on the failing test and the related code, it seems that the function is intended to support different types of indexes, specifically `Float64Index` and datetime/timedelta indexes. The function tries to ensure that the keys provided for indexing match the type of the index.

The failing test specifically fails when the index is of type `Float64Index` and the key is a float value. The error message indicates that the function is unable to handle non-integer indexers for the `Float64Index` case.

The issue on GitHub titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" highlights the problem with Series lookups being affected for the `Float64Index` case.

To fix the bug, the function `_convert_key` needs to properly handle the case when the index is a `Float64Index`. It should allow float values as keys and correctly handle their comparison with the index.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
1. Modify the logic in the `_convert_key` function to accommodate float values for the `Float64Index` case.
2. Check for the type of the index and handle the comparison of keys accordingly.
3. Update the error handling to account for non-integer indexers in the `Float64Index` case.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

This corrected function should fix the bug and satisfy all the failing test cases and expected input/output variable information provided.
