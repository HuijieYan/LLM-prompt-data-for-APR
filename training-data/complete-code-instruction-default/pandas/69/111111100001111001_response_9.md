Potential error location: The potential error in the function lies in the if-else conditions where it checks for the type of index and its compatibility with the key.

Bug's cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect checks to determine the type of index and its compatibility with the key. The function is incorrectly checking the type of index and its integer properties, leading to incorrect validation and potential errors.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the condition to check the type of the key and its compatibility with the index.
2. Use the appropriate methods to determine the type of the index and the key.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if getattr(ax, 'is_integer', None) and ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and getattr(ax, 'holds_integer', None) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and fix the bug in the original function.
