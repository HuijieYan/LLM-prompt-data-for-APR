1. The buggy function is part of the class _AtIndexer, which appears to be responsible for indexing operations on a data structure. The function _convert_key is used to convert the key to a specific type based on the index. The class also inherits from _ScalarAccessIndexer and is associated with the Appender class.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when checking if the index is an integer or non-integer, as well as the type of the index compared to the type of the axis.

3. The bug in the function may be causing incorrect validation of the key type compared to the index type, which can result in incorrect indexing or raise unnecessary ValueError exceptions.

4. Approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly validate the key type with respect to the index type, based on the class context and the purpose of the function.
   - Refactor the logic to improve clarity and reduce the likelihood of errors.

5. Corrected code:
```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```
In the corrected code, I have refactored the logic of the _convert_key function to properly validate the key type with respect to the index type. Additionally, I have used the isinstance() function to check the type of the index, which should prevent unnecessary errors and improve the functionality of the function.
