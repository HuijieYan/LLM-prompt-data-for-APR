Analyzing the provided information, it seems that the bug is caused by the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class within the pandas/core/indexing.py file. The error message indicates that the bug is related to handling non-integer indexers in the at based indexing.

The failing test case in the test_lookups_datetimelike_values function calls the at function with a non-integer indexer, which leads to a ValueError being raised in the _convert_key function.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" explains that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which is related to the issue with the at function.

To fix the bug, the _convert_key function needs to be modified to handle non-integer indexers correctly.

The corrected code for the _convert_key function in the _AtIndexer class is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.is_all_dates():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The changes made in the corrected code include using `pd.api.types.is_integer` to check for integer values and `ax.is_all_dates()` to check for non-integer indexers.

With this correction, the at based indexing should handle both integer and non-integer indexers correctly, and the failing test case should pass successfully. The bug reported in the GitHub issue should also be resolved with this fix.
