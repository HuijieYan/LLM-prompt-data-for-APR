The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the section where it checks if the key is an integer or not. There may be issues in correctly identifying whether the key is an integer or not, leading to incorrect error messages or exceptions being raised.

The bug's cause may be due to incorrect identification of whether the key is an integer or not, leading to the wrong error message being raised.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for checking if the key is an integer or not, and update the error messages accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer indexers are required for an integer index"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "Non-integer indexers are required for a non-integer index"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we have used the `isinstance` function to check if the key is an integer or not. We have also updated the error message to be more descriptive and accurate.
