The issue lies in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class. In this function, it checks if the key is of the same type as the index and returns the key. However, the implementation is incorrect and does not handle all cases properly, leading to failing tests.

The bug is caused by the function not handling different types of indexes properly, which leads to unexpected behavior when accessing the data in the Series. This issue affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to properly handle different types of indexes and ensure that the key is of the same type as the index before returning it.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to explicitly perform type checking and conversion if necessary for the key and the index. This will ensure that the key is always of the correct type before returning it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    index_type = type(self.obj.index)
    key_type = type(key)

    if index_type != key_type:
        try:
            key = index_type(key)
        except ValueError:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid key type, expected {index_type}.")

    return key
```

This corrected code explicitly checks if the type of the key matches the type of the index, and if not, it attempts to convert the key to the correct type using the index_type constructor. If the conversion fails, it raises a ValueError.

This approach ensures that the key is always of the correct type as expected by the index, resolving the bug and addressing the issue posted on GitHub.
