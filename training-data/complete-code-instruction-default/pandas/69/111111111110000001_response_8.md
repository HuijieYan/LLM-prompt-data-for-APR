The problematic function `_convert_key` takes a key and a boolean `is_setter` as input, and returns the key after performing some checks. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the key conversion when using `ser.at[4]`. This suggests that the key conversion logic inside the `_convert_key` function is causing the problem.

The `_convert_key` function should correctly handle the key conversion based on the type of the index. It should also account for the scenario where an integer key is provided for a non-integer index.

The issue may be in the logic where the function iterates through the axes and checks for integer or non-integer indexes.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to update the logic inside the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle the different cases based on the index type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

The corrected version of the `_convert_key` function now correctly handles the scenario where an integer key is provided for a non-integer index.
