Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. You need to output complete fixed function, the fix patch will be used to replace original buggy function.


# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(

                    )
            else:

                    raise ValueError(

1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the buggy class, .
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The buggy class

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code
