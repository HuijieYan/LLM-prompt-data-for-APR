The issue is related to the `_convert_key` function inside the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is responsible for converting the key based on the type of the index. However, it is currently raising an error when the index is non-integer and it receives an integer key.

The failing test is related to Series lookups on a Float64Index and TimedeltaIndex, which are related to the behavior of the `_convert_key` function. The error message indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexers correctly.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" signifies that this is a bug related to specific cases in `get_value` for DateTimeIndex and Float64Index.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexers correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function inside the `_AtIndexer` class:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function checks whether the index is an integer index or a non-integer index and then appropriately handles the key based on the index type. This should resolve the failing test and the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function should now pass the failing test provided and also satisfy the expected input and output variable information. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
