The bug in the `_convert_key` function is that it does not properly handle the conversion when one of the `ax` values is a floating point number. It incorrectly checks if `ax.is_integer()` instead of `isinstance(ax, Float64Index)`. Additionally, it currently tries to call `is_integer(i)`, which is not a valid function.

Based on the failing test and error message, we can conclude that the `_convert_key` function is not handling the case where the index contains floating point numbers correctly. When attempting to use `ser.at[4]`, it should cast to 4.0 to match the `.loc` behavior. This suggests that the function is not properly converting integer keys to float keys.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should first check the type of the axes and convert the keys to the appropriate type to match the index.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if isinstance(i, int):
                i = float(i)
        elif isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex) or isinstance(ax, TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, np.datetime64, pd.Timedelta, np.timedelta64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index or timedelta index "
                    "can only have datetime or timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")

    return key
```

This adjusted function will first check the type of the axes, and then convert the keys to the appropriate type if needed. This should handle the cases where the index contains floating point numbers and resolve the bug.

This corrected code should address the failing test and produce the expected input/output variable information.
