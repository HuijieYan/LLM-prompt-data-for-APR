The potential error location within the problematic function lies in the for loop where it checks the type of index and raises a ValueError if it doesn't match the type of index.

The bug is caused because the function is not properly handling the case when the index type does not match the type of the key being passed to the function. This leads to unexpected behavior and errors in certain cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle the case when the index type does not match the type of the key being passed. This can be done by checking the type of the key and comparing it with the type of the index, and then raising a ValueError if they do not match.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        if not isinstance(i, int) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code properly handles the case when the key type does not match the index type and raises a ValueError accordingly, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.
