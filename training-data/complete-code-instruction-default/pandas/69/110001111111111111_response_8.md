### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the section that checks for integer indexes and integer indexers. It seems that the function is not handling the cases of datetime/timedelta indexes properly, which is causing the failing tests.

### Bug Cause
The `_convert_key` function is not properly handling cases where the index and indexer are of different types. This causes the ValueError to be raised when it shouldn't, leading to failing tests.

The failing tests indicate that there is a problem with indexing using floating-point values that correspond to datetime or timedelta indexes, and the function is not handling this case correctly.

The GitHub issue mentions that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the failing tests.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the `_convert_key` function to handle cases where the index and indexer are of different types, particularly for datetime and timedelta indexes.
2. Adjust the logic to properly determine whether the index and indexer are compatible, and only raise a ValueError if they are truly incompatible.
3. Consider converting the indexer to the same type as the index before performing the checks, if necessary.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            i = pd.Timestamp(i)  # Convert to Timestamp for datetime-like indexes
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected function handles the case where the index is a datetime or timedelta index by converting the indexer `i` to a `pd.Timestamp` if necessary before performing the checks. This should address the failing test cases and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
