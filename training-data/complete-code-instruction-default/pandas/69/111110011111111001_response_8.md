The buggy function `_convert_key` is attempting to handle the case when the `is_setter` parameter is false, but it is not doing so effectively. The function is raising a `ValueError` in cases where the input key `i` is not an integer when the axis `ax` is an integer, or vice versa. This is causing the failing tests since the implementation is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should be modified to correctly handle non-integer keys when the axis is an integer and vice versa.
The functionality of the `_convert_key` function can be modified such that it checks if the input type `i` matches the type of the index axis `ax`, and raise a `ValueError` if the types do not correspond.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        # Check if the type of 'i' matches the type of the index axis 'ax'
        if not isinstance(i, type(ax[0])):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing with an index type {0} "
                "can only accept indexers of type {0}".format(type(ax[0]).__name__)
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected function, all the failing tests should pass, and the expected and actual input/output variable information provided above will be satisfied.
