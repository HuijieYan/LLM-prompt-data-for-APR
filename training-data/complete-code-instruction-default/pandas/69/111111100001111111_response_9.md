The issue stems from the `_convert_key` function not correctly handling indices when the key and index are of different types. Additionally, there are discrepancies in the expected input/output variable value information provided, indicating that the function is not handling different types of indexes correctly.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the function is not properly handling cases where the key and index have different types, specifically when the key is a tuple containing only one element.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle different types of indices and keys. We need to check the type of the index and the type of the key, and ensure that they are compatible. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function can handle tuples containing only one element, as this seems to be a potential issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if isinstance(key, tuple) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code ensures that the key is correctly handled when it's a tuple containing only one element and checks compatibility between the index and the key, based on the expected input/output variable information provided. This fix should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
