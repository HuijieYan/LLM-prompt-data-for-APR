The issue with the buggy function is that it's not properly checking whether the index and the key have the same data type. This is leading to errors when the key is not the same data type as the index.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _convert_key function to properly check the data types of the key and the index before performing any operations.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if type(ax[0]) != type(i):
                raise ValueError("Index and key must have the same data type")
        return key
```

With this change, the function will properly check that the index and key have the same data type, and raise a ValueError if they do not. This will ensure that the function handles different data types correctly and prevents any errors from occurring.
