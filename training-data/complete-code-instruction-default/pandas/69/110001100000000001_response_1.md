Potential error location: the comparison on line 13 using `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()`.

Bug's cause: The comparison on line 13 is checking if `ax` (which represents the index) is an integer index or holds integers, but the functions `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` do not exist. This is causing the comparison to fail and potentially leading to incorrect error raising.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the index is of integer type by using `is_integer()` method on the index.
2. Check if the index holds integer values using a method like `dtype` to check the data type of the index.

The corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):  # Check if the index is of integer type
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax.dtype, int):  # Check if the index holds integer values
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
