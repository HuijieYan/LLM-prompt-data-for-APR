The function is supposed to require the keys to be the same type as the index, with some validations to ensure the proper types are being used. However, the function doesn't actually convert the key to the same type as the index and is missing type checks that would validate the equivalence.

The bug is located within the logic that attempts to ensure the key is of the same type as the index, which has been omitted. Additionally, the validation logic inside the loop doesn't include a check for the type of the key when the index is non-integer and the key is expected to be an integer.

Approach for fixing the bug:
- Add type conversion for the key to ensure it matches the type of the index.
- Include additional type checks inside the loop to validate the equivalence as per the function's objective.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    idx_type = type(self.obj.index[0])
    key = tuple(map(idx_type, key))  # convert key to the same type as the index

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an datetime index can only have datetime indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")

    return key
```
