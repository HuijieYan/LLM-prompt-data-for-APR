1. The buggy function is a method called "_convert_key" within an _AtIndexer class. It is used to validate keys and ensure they are the same type as the index before performing indexing operations. The failing test is related to lookups for datetime and timedelta values using Float64Index. The error message indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexers correctly, leading to a ValueError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop that checks for integer indexers. It is not correctly handling non-integer indexers.

3. The bug's cause is a validation error within the _convert_key function when dealing with non-integer indexers, as indicated by the ValueError in the error message and the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a condition to correctly handle non-integer indexers in the loop within the _convert_key function.
   - Reviewing the logic for handling different types of indexers and ensuring that the validation process is accurate.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This correction ensures that the function can handle different types of indexers correctly and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
