The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic to check if the key has the same type as the index, based on whether the index is integer or non-integer. The error occurs at the point where the function raises a ValueError if the key does not match the type of the index.

The bug is causing the function to raise a ValueError when it encounters non-integer keys for a Float64Index, even though it should allow arbitrary setting for non-integer indexes. This is evidenced by the failing test cases and the GitHub issue indicating that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, the condition for non-integer indexes should be modified to allow arbitrary setting for non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        # Check for non-integer index
        if not ax.is_integer():
            continue
        
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```

With this modification, the function will properly allow arbitrary setting for non-integer indexes, and the failing test cases should pass. This will also satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
