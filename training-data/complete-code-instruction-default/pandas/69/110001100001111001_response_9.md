The bug seems to be occurring because the function is not handling the cases where the index is of type datetime64 or timedelta64, and the input key contains integer values.

To fix the bug, we need to check the type of index and the type of the key, and raise appropriate errors if the combination is not supported.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an datetime index "
                    "can only have timestamp indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an timedelta index "
                    "can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
    
    return key
```

This code checks the type of the index and the type of the key, and raises errors if the combination is not supported. It satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided.
