The buggy function `_convert_key` is causing the issue because it is not handling the cases of datetime and timedelta indexes properly. The function is raising a `ValueError` when it encounters a non-integer index.

The bug's cause stems from the fact that the function is not properly handling non-integer indexes, leading to a `ValueError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes. We need to check the type of the index and the type of the key before processing it. If the index is of type `datetime` or `timedelta`, we should not check for integer values and directly return the key.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            return key

        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This revised function checks if the index is of type `datetime` or `timedelta` and directly returns the key without further processing. For other types of indexes, it performs the previous integer type checking.

The corrected `_convert_key` function should now handle the datetime and timedelta indexes correctly and resolve the issue reported in the failing test cases.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
