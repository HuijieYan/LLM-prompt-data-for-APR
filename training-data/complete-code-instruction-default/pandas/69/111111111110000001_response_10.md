The problematic function `_convert_key` is used to convert the given key to a list according to the index type. The error message indicates that for non-integer indices, only non-integer indexers are allowed, and a ValueError is being raised at the related line.

The buggy function does not seem to differentiate between the cases of a setter and a getter. Additionally, the condition to check for integer indexers and non-integer indexers is causing the issue, as it is not correctly handling non-integer indices and indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to add a proper condition to check for setter or getter, handle non-integer indices and indexers separately, and update the method's logic to differentiate between float and integer index types.

Here's the corrected function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this updated function, it should handle both integer and non-integer indexers correctly, and the failing test should pass.
