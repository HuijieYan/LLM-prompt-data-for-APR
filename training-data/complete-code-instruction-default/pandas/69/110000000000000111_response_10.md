1. The buggy function is a method that is possibly used to convert keys to a specific type when performing indexing in a DataFrame or Series. The GitHub issue mentions that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which suggests that the bug might be related to incorrect handling of index types in the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the validation and conversion of index keys, especially when dealing with integer and non-integer indexes.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The buggy function does not handle the cases of integer and non-integer indexes correctly.
   (b). The GitHub issue suggests that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case, which implies that the function is not properly handling Float64Index and causing issues during value retrieval.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   (a). Validate the index type and ensure proper conversion of keys based on the index type.
   (b). Update the function to handle the Float64Index case correctly and account for both integer and non-integer indexes.

5. Corrected Code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):  # Check if the index is a Float64Index
            if not isinstance(i, float):  # Ensure key is a float for Float64Index
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, float):  # Check if key is a float for non-Float64Index cases
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-Float64Index index can only have non-float indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code:
- The function now includes additional checks for Float64Index and handles the key conversion accordingly.
- The function ensures that for a Float64Index, only float indexers are allowed, and for other index types, non-float indexers are enforced.
- The corrected code aims to resolve the bug and align with the GitHub issue's description related to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.
