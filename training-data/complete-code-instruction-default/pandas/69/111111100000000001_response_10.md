The problematic function is `_convert_key` within the class `_AtIndexer` in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. This function is responsible for converting the keys to be the same type as the index. The potential error lies in the if-else condition where it checks if the key is an integer and if the index holds an integer.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling all possible input scenarios correctly. It is only checking if the index holds an integer, but it should also be checking if the index does not hold an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the for loop to check for both scenarios. We can also simplify the logic to make it more readable and maintainable.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # this is the fixed function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:  # index does not hold an integer
                if is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected version, we have added an else condition to handle the scenario where the index does not hold an integer. We have also updated the error messages to make them more descriptive. These changes address the issue and ensure that the function handles all possible input scenarios correctly.
