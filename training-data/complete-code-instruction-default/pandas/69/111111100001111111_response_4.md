The potential error location within the problematic function is at the comparison of the index and key types. The function is not handling cases where the index is of type `datetime64[ns]` or `timedelta64[ns]`.

The bug is causing the function to incorrectly compare the types of the index and keys, leading to unexpected ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_convert_key` function to handle both `datetime64[ns]` and `timedelta64[ns]` types correctly, and perform the comparisons accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = self.obj.index.dtype
    key_type = np.asarray(key).dtype

    if index_type != key_type:
        raise ValueError("Key type must match index type for at based indexing")

    return key
```

With this fix, the function should now handle cases where the index is of type `datetime64[ns]` or `timedelta64[ns]` correctly.

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
