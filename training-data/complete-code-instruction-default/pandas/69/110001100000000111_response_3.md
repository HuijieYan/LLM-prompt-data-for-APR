The issue is with the `_convert_key` function in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. This function is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index. The bug causes problems with series lookups for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the for loop that checks the type of the index.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the type checking within the for loop. The function should be checking for the type of the index and the type of the key, but it appears to be checking for whether the index is an integer or not. This is causing issues with the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, we can modify the type checking logic within the for loop to correctly compare the types of the index and the key. Additionally, we should check for the Float64Index case specifically and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError("Float64Index can only have float indexers")
        elif not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError("Non-Float64Index can only have non-float indexers")
            
    return key
```

This corrected function addresses the issue with the Float64Index case and should successfully resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
