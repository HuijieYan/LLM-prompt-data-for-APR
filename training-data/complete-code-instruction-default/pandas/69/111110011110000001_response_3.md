The buggy function `_convert_key` is intended to replace a non-integer indexer with an `integer` in the return key. 

The bug is caused by the incorrect condition checking in the else block of the for-loop in the `_convert_key` function. The ValueError is raised when it should not be, leading to test failures.

The `_AtIndexer` class contains the `_convert_key` function. The test case `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is failing with the `ValueError` message, expecting non-integer indexers but receiving integer indexers.

To fix the bug, the if-else condition inside the for-loop of the `_convert_key` function needs to be checked to make sure that indexers are handled correctly based on their types.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index " 
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
This correction will handle the non-integer indexers correctly and resolve the ValueError.
