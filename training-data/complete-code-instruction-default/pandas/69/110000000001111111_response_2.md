3. The potential error location within the problematic function is the validation of the indexes in the for loop. It seems it is not correctly handling the cases for integer and non-integer indexes.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly validating the type of the index and the value of the key.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Modify the logic for validating the index type and key value to properly handle integer and non-integer indexes.
- Use the appropriate methods to check if the index is an integer or holds an integer.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.index, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, (float, int)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a float index can only have float or integer indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
    return key
```

This corrected code properly validates the type of the index and the value of the key for different index types like datetime, timedelta, float, and integer. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
