1. The buggy function is supposed to check if the key is of the same type as the index, and if it is an integer index, it should only accept integer indexers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the validation for integer and non-integer indexers.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is calling methods such as 'is_integer()' and 'holds_integer()' without properly referencing them.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the type of the key and the index separately.
   - Using the correct method to check if the key is an integer or not.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we are using the `isinstance()` function to check the type of the index and the key. We are also using `pd.Int64Index` to check if the index is an integer index. This will fix the bug and properly validate the index and key types.
