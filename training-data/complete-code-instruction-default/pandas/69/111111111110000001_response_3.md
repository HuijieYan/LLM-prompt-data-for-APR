The problematic function is `_convert_key` which is causing a `ValueError` in the failing test. The function tries to require that the keys are the same type as the index, but it does a flawed comparison which is causing the `ValueError`.

The cause of the bug is in the logic of the loop checking the type of the index keys. It is incorrectly checking if a value is an integer or not and raising a `ValueError` based on that comparison.

To fix the bug, the logic within the loop needs to be revised to correctly compare the types of the index keys with the index and raise the `ValueError` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Requires the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and not raise the `ValueError`.
