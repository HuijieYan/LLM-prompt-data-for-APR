Potential Error Location:
The function is iterating through the axes of the object to which it belongs, and for each axis, it compares the type of the index with the type of the elements in the key tuple. The issue seems to be at the comparison step where it checks if the index is an integer or holds integers, as the conditions and comparisons are not reflective of the actual requirements.

Bug's Cause:

(a) The buggy function is intended to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index, but the comparison logic being used for integer types is flawed.
(b) The related functions DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value seem to be affected due to the mismatch in the type comparison in the _convert_key function.
(c) The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values lie in the fact that the function is not appropriately handling the type comparisons, leading to errors when accessing the values in the Series object.
(d) The GitHub issue mentions that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the issues observed in the bug descriptions.

Approaches to Fix the Bug:
1. Revise the type comparison logic to accurately check if the key tuple elements have the same type as the index.
2. Ensure that the conditions for integer and non-integer type checking are properly defined and implemented.
3. Test the function with the provided input cases to verify that the type comparison logic operates as expected.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError(
                "Datetime index can only have integer or float indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError(
                "Timedelta index can only have integer or float indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.NumericIndex) and not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError(
                "Numeric index can only have integer or float indexers"
            )
    return key
```

The updated function includes revised type comparison logic, ensuring that the type of the elements in the key tuple aligns with the type of the index. It specifically handles different index types (DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex, NumericIndex) and checks if the key elements are of the appropriate type. This corrected code should resolve the bug and address the issues mentioned in the GitHub report.
