The problem in the function is in the condition for checking if the index is an integer or not. The issue is in the line "if  ax.is_integer():" because there is no 'is_integer()' function in the 'ax' object. This should be 'is_integer_dtype()' function to check if the index is of integer type.

The possible approach to fix the bug is to replace the 'is_integer()' function with 'is_integer_dtype()' to check if the index is of integer type and also rename 'is_integer()' in the error messages to 'is_integer_dtype()' for consistency.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer_dtype():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
