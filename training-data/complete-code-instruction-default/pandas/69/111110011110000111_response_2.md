Analysis:
The buggy function `_convert_key` is supposed to convert the key to the same type as the index, throwing a ValueError if the type does not match. However, the error message indicates that there is an issue with non-integer indexing on a non-integer index.

The failing test in the `tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` file is testing the behavior of `ser.at[4]` and the error message indicates that there is an issue with non-integer indexing on a non-integer index.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that there are corner cases affecting the behavior of `get_value` for both DTI and Float64Index.

Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_convert_key` is not handling the case of non-integer indexing on a non-integer index properly, leading to a ValueError being raised.

Potential Fix:
1. Update the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexing on a non-integer index.
2. Ensure that the conversion of the key to the same type as the index is handled correctly for all cases.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code should handle the conversion of the key properly and avoid raising a ValueError for non-integer indexing on a non-integer index. It should also pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
