1. The buggy function is a method called `_convert_key` that is likely a part of a class. The function is used to convert the key to the same type as the index. The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that there are issues with corner cases in the `get_value` function for DTI and Float64Index cases. This suggests that the `convert_key` function may be related to these issues.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the loops that iterate through the axes and the key to check for integer indexers. This is where the logic for type checking seems to be implemented.

3. (a) The buggy function `_convert_key` seems to be related to indexing and type checking of keys to match the index type.
   (b) The GitHub issue indicates that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which suggests that there are issues with indexing and value retrieval from Series objects.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the type checking logic in the `_convert_key` function to ensure that it matches the index type correctly.
   - Check the implementation of the `get_value` function for DTI and Float64Index cases to ensure that it is compatible with the type checking in `_convert_key`.
   - Test various scenarios, including corner cases, to validate the fixes.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes changes to the type checking logic and uses `isinstance` to check for the types of the index and key elements. These changes aim to address the issues with corner cases in the `_convert_key` function and to ensure that it aligns with the `get_value` function for DTI and Float64Index cases.
