Based on the error message and the provided information, it appears that the buggy function is not handling float values properly in the context of the index. The failing tests are highlighting the issue where the function is raising a `ValueError` because it is expecting keys to be of the same type as the index.

The cause of the bug is in the `_convert_key` function, where it checks for the type of each key and compares it with the index. The function is not handling float keys correctly and raising the `ValueError` inappropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle float values properly and align them with the index type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = type(self.obj.index)

    if index_type in (pd.Float64Index, pd.Int64Index):
        # Convert key to float if index is float type
        key = [float(k) for k in key]
    elif index_type in (pd.TimedeltaIndex, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        # Convert key to timedelta if index is timedelta type
        key = [pd.Timedelta(k) if pd._libs.lib.is_timedelta64_arraylike(k) else k for k in key]

    return key
```

In this corrected version:
- We first identify the type of the index (`index_type`) to properly handle the conversion of keys.
- For float indexes, we convert the key to the `float` type.
- For timedelta indexes, we convert the key to the `pd.Timedelta` type if it isn't already a timedelta.

This corrected version should address the issues with handling float keys and align them with the index type properly.

Please replace the original `_convert_key` function with this corrected version, and it should resolve the bug.
