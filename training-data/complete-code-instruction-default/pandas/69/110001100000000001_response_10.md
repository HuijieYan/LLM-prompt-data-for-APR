Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):  # Check if axis is integer and index is integer
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):  # Check if axis is non-integer and index is non-integer
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key

```

In the original code, there are issues with the `is_integer()` method and `is_integer()` function call. It seems that `ax` should be used with the `is_integer()` method instead of `is_integer` function call in the if-else conditions. 

In the corrected code, we have used `ax.is_integer()` to check if the axis is an integer and `isinstance(i, int)` to check if the index is an integer.

These changes address the bug by correctly checking the type of the index based on the type of the axis and raising the appropriate ValueError if the types do not match.
