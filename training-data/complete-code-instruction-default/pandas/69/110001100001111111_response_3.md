The buggy function has an issue with handling the type of index and key values. The function is supposed to require the keys to be the same type as the index, but it is not currently doing so. This causes issues with series lookups, particularly for the Float64Index case.

The bug is likely located in the section where the function checks for the type of index and keys. It is not properly differentiating between integer and non-integer indexes and keys, which leads to the ValueError being raised incorrectly.

The bug's cause stems from the function not properly checking the type of index and keys. This causes the function to raise ValueErrors in cases where it should not.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the type of index and keys. It should differentiate between integer and non-integer indexes, and raise ValueErrors only when there is a mismatch.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.holds_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the type of index and keys, and it should no longer raise ValueErrors incorrectly. This resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
