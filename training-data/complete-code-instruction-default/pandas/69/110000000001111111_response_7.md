The buggy function `_convert_key` is designed to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index. However, the function is not correctly handling the cases when the index is a Float64Index or when dealing with non-integer indexes. This is causing issues with the Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

The potential error in the function lies in the logic for checking the types and values of the index and the key.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values show that the function is not correctly handling the cases when the index is a Float64Index or a non-integer index.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle cases when the index is a Float64Index and when dealing with non-integer indexes. This can be achieved by adding appropriate checks and conditions to handle these cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, type(ax[0])):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Index type mismatch"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code handles the cases when the index is a Float64Index and when dealing with non-integer indexes, and it satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
