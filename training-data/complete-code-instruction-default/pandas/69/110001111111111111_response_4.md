The issue is occurring due to the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is not handling the conversion of keys properly, which is causing the failing test cases.

The issue is with the implementation of the `_convert_key` function. It is not handling the conversion of keys correctly for different types of indexes, causing the ValueError to be raised.

The failing test is related to a Series with datetime64 and timedelta64 values where the `get_value` method is being used, and the results are not as expected due to the incorrect handling of keys.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_convert_key` function to handle the conversion of keys based on the index type properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    index_type = type(self.obj.index).__name__
    if index_type == 'Float64Index':
        key = tuple(map(float, key))
    elif index_type in ['DatetimeIndex', 'TimedeltaIndex']:
        key = tuple(map(pd.Timestamp, key))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")
    
    return key
```

With this updated function, the conversion of keys will be correctly handled based on the index type, ensuring that the keys are of the same type as the index.

This corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to this bug.
