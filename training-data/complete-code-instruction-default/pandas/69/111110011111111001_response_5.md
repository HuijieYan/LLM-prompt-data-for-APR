The issue occurs when the index and the keys are not of the same type, causing the function to raise a ValueError. To fix this, we need to update the _convert_key function to handle different types of indexes such as integer and non-integer indexes appropriately. 

The following is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if isinstance(i, int) or isinstance(i, np.integer):
                    i = ax.inferred_type(i)
                else:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, np.integer):
                    i = ax.inferred_type(i)
                else:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle different types of indexes appropriately and pass the failing tests.
