1. The buggy function is related to the issue on GitHub as it is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index, which is crucial for accurate series lookups in the case of Float64Index.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the conditional statements where it checks if the index is integer or non-integer.

3. The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling the conversion of keys to the same type as the index, leading to issues with series lookups for Float64Index. This is evident from the GitHub issue details that specify the problem with series lookups for the Float64Index case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve reviewing the conditional logic within the function to ensure that it accurately checks the type of index and the corresponding key. Additionally, proper handling of integer and non-integer indexers should be implemented to resolve the bug.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function which resolves the issue:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
