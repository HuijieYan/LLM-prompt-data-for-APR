The buggy function `_convert_key` in the `_AtIndexer` class of the `indexing.py` file is causing the ValueError. The function is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index, but it is not handling non-integer indexes properly, resulting in the ValueError.

The related failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is specifically testing the behavior for `ser.at[4]`, which is causing the ValueError due to incorrect key conversion.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" describes that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which is in line with the failing test and the error message.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to handle non-integer indexes properly. The function should check for non-integer indexes and ensure that only non-integer indexers are allowed in such cases.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) or ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this corrected code, the bug should be fixed. The corrected function handles non-integer indexes properly and ensures that only non-integer indexers are allowed in such cases. This fix should address the failing test and resolve the issue as described in the GitHub post.
