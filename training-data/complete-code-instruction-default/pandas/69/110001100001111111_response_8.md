The issue is that the function is not properly handling the types of the index and the keys that are being passed in. It should be checking if the key is of the same type as the index, but it's currently not doing that correctly.

The bug's cause is that the function is not appropriately checking the types of the index and the keys, leading to potential errors when trying to match them.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the types of the index and keys. We should also update the error messages to be more informative.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, type(i)):
            continue
        if not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )

    return key
```

This updated code now properly checks the types of the index and keys, and raises informative error messages if a mismatch is found.

This should now resolve the issue posted on GitHub, as the function now correctly handles the different types of indices and keys.
