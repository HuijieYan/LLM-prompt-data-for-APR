1. The buggy function is a private method that is supposed to convert the keys to the same type as the index. It also checks whether the keys are integers if the index is of an integer type. However, there are several issues with the implementation, such as using "is_integer" and "holds_integer" without proper context and some incorrect conditional checks.

2. The potential error locations within the problematic function are the conditionals that check whether the index is an integer and whether it holds an integer.

3. The potential cause of the bug is using "is_integer" and "holds_integer" without proper context and incorrect conditional checks. It seems like the intention was to check the data type and whether it is an integer, but the implementation is incorrect.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using the correct method to check the data type and whether it is an integer.
   - Ensuring that the conditionals are properly implemented to check the index type and handle the cases accordingly.

5. Here is the corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.dtype.kind == 'i':
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and ax.dtype.kind != 'i':
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
