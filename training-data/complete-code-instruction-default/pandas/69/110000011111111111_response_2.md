Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `_convert_key` function, particularly in the block that checks for integer and non-integer indexers.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by the _convert_key function not correctly handling cases where the index is a Float64Index or a DatetimeIndex. The function is raising a ValueError when it encounters non-integer indexers, which is not appropriate for these index types.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the _convert_key function to handle Float64Index and DatetimeIndex cases separately and appropriately.
2. Update the logic to check for index type and handle non-integer indexers accordingly.

Fixed code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not pd.api.types.is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a DatetimeIndex can only have datetime indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated function uses `isinstance` checks to handle Float64Index and DatetimeIndex separately. It then checks for the appropriate type of indexer before raising a ValueError. This should resolve the issue with Series lookups affected for the Float64Index case and satisfy the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
