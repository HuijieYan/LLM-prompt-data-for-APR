Since the code provided is just a small part of a larger class and is not sufficient to identify the exact problem, it appears that there are potential issues with conversion of keys when setting or getting values in the index. This can lead to errors in series lookups affecting the Float64Index case, as reported in the GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value."

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic used to convert the keys and check for integer or non-integer indexes.

The bug's cause seems to be related to the improper handling of keys and indexes in the _convert_key function when getting or setting values in the series, especially for the Float64Index case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
- Ensuring that the logic for converting keys and checking index types aligns with the specific requirements for the Float64Index case.
- Adding additional checks and validations to handle corner cases that may lead to errors in series lookups.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, (IntegerIndex, Float64Index)):
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index or Float64Index can only have integer indexers."
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) or isinstance(i, float):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."
                    )
        return key
```
This corrected code ensures that the keys are properly validated according to the type of index being used, including the specific requirements for the Float64Index case.
