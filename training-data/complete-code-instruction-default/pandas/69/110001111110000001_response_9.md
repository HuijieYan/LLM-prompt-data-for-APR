The `_convert_key` function seems to be related to indexing in the pandas library. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between integer and non-integer indexers. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` creates a series with a float64 index and then attempts to access the elements using `.at[]`, `.loc[]`, and other methods. The error message specifies that the integer and non-integer indexes are not being handled correctly.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to handle integer and non-integer indexers appropriately. It should also ensure that the type of the index should match the type of the key being passed, especially with respect to integer-based and non-integer-based indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() != is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on an {'integer' if ax.is_integer() else 'non-integer'} index "
                f"can only have {'integer' if ax.is_integer() else 'non-integer'} indexers"
            )

    return key
```

This updated function will handle the scenarios where keys do not match the index types and raise an appropriate ValueError.

The corrected fix should now pass both the failing `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` test cases and should not raise any ValueError as per the error message.
