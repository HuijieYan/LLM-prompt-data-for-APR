The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is related to the `IndexingMixin.at` method which is part of the `_AtIndexer` class. 
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `_convert_key` function which is unable to handle integer and non-integer indexers properly. 

The issue is arising because the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexers appropriately. This is causing the ValueError to be raised, leading to the failing test.

To fix this issue:
1. The `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to handle both integer and non-integer indexers correctly.
2. The function should check if the index is an integer or not, and then only allow integer or non-integer indexers accordingly.

Here's the corrected `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) or ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected `_convert_key` function will now handle integer and non-integer indexers appropriately, resolving the issue and allowing the failing test to pass.
