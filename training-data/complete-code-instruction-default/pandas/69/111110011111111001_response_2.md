The bug in the function `_convert_key` is caused by the comparison between the index type and the type of the key elements. The function should only raise an error if the key elements are not the same type as the index, but currently, it compares the key type to the integer status of the index axes.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to compare the type of the key elements with the type of the index, and raise an error if they are not the same type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if type(i) != type(ax[0]):
                raise ValueError(
                    "The type of the key does not match the type of the index"
                )
        return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function will compare the type of each key element with the type of the index and raise a `ValueError` if they are not the same type.

This fix should ensure that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
