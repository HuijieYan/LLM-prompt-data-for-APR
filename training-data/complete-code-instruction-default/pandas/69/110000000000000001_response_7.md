1. The buggy function is designed to convert a key, with an optional flag to indicate if it is a setter or not. It checks if the key is of the same type as the index and raises ValueError if not.

2. The potential error location in the function is the section that checks if the element of the key is an integer or not.

3. The bug is caused by using the function is_integer() and is_integer(i), which are not defined in the given context. This function is also missing the import statements that define these functions.

4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that we are using the correct functions to check if the key is an integer or not and ensure that these functions are properly imported.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    import numpy as np # Assuming that is_integer is a function from numpy
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, int):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
