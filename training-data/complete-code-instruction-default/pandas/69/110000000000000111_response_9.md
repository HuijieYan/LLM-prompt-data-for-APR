The buggy function is a method that is a part of a larger codebase that is likely for some sort of indexing or data manipulation. The function takes in a key and a boolean flag 'is_setter' and processes the key based on the flag value. The bug seems to be related to index type validation for different cases, particularly for integer and non-integer indexes.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the conditional statements that check for the index type and raise ValueError if the condition does not match. 

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" specifically mentions that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case. This aligns with the functionality of the _convert_key function as it seems to be related to indexing and series operations.

The bug's cause seems to be related to the conditional checks for index type within the function. It appears that the function is not handling different index types properly, leading to issues with data lookups.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to review the conditional checks and ensure that they are correctly identifying the index type and handling the key accordingly. Additionally, comprehensive unit tests should be created to cover all possible index type scenarios.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In this corrected code, the conditional checks have been updated to properly identify the index type using the `np.issubdtype` function and handle the key accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
