The problem is occurring in the `_convert_key` function in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The error message indicates that the issue is related to how the function handles non-integer indexes. This is causing the ValueError to be raised when using the `ser.at[4]` method in the failing test.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" highlights the problem with Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexes correctly and prevent the ValueError from being raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):  # Use pd.api.types.is_integer to check for integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.is_type_compatible('integer'):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This modified code uses `pd.api.types.is_integer` and `ax.is_type_compatible` to check for integer types and handle non-integer indexes correctly. With this change, the function should now handle non-integer indexes without raising a ValueError.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
