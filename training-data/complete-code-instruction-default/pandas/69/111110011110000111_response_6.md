**Analysis:**

The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index and validating them. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is testing the behavior of this function when dealing with datetime64 or timedelta64 values. The error message indicates that there is an issue with indexing on an non-integer index.

The associated GitHub issue mentions that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, indicating that the bug is related to the handling of float indices.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug is caused by the `_convert_key` function not correctly handling non-integer indices and failing to raise an error when it encounters them.

**Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:**
1. Modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indices and raise an error when encountered.

**Corrected Code:**
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):  # Check if the value is an integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():  # Check if the value is a non-integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The corrected code modifies the `_convert_key` function to properly handle both integer and non-integer indices and raise a ValueError when encountering a mismatch. This should address the issue with Series lookups on Float64Index and resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
