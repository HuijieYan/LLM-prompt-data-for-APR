Potential Error Location: The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop that iterates through the axes and checks if the index is an integer.

Bug Cause: The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indexes within the loop, leading to improper validation of the key.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Include proper type checking for the index and handle integer and non-integer indexes accordingly.
2. Ensure that the loop iterates through the axes and checks for index type compatibility.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):




    # this is the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):  # check if index is an integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():  # check if index is a non-integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
