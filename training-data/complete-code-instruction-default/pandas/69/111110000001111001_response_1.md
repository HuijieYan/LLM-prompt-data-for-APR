The bug in the function is due to a logic error. The function is intended to require the keys to be the same type as the index, but the current implementation is not achieving that. Additionally, the logic for whether the index is an integer or non-integer is incorrect. It is treating the index as an integer if it is `is_integer()` and it is treating the index as a non-integer if it is not `is_integer()`. However, the correct behavior should be to treat the index as non-integer if it is `is_integer()` and as an integer if it is not `is_integer()`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for checking if the index is an integer or non-integer and validate the keys accordingly. We should also update the return statement to make sure the correct keys are being returned.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected function implementation should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
