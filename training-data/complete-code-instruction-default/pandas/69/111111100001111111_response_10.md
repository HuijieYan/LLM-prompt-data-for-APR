The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements for checking if the index is an integer and the value being passed in. There is a mismatch between the expected types for the key and the actual implementation of the function based on the input/output variable information provided.

The bug's cause is likely due to the function not correctly handling different types of indexes (e.g., `Float64Index` and `DatetimeIndex`) and their corresponding keys.

To fix the bug, we can implement a check for the type of the index and modify the conditional statements accordingly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function handles both float and integer values correctly for different index types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have timestamp indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code should handle the different types of indexes and their corresponding keys, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
