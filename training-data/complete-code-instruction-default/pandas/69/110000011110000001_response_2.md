The buggy function is _convert_key() and it seems to be causing an error in the at[4] method. The error message indicates that the issue occurs because "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not handling non-integer indexes properly, which is causing the ValueError when using the at[4] method.

To fix this bug, we can modify the _convert_key() function to handle non-integer indexes correctly. We should check if the index is non-integer and make sure that the key is also non-integer before returning it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not is_integer(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
By adding a check to see if the index is non-integer, and then ensuring that the key is also non-integer before returning it, we can fix the bug and pass the failing test.
