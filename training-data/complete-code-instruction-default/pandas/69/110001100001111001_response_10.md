The issue with the buggy function seems to be that it is trying to check whether the index of the dataframe is of integer type, but it's doing the wrong check by using the `is_integer()` method which is not suitable for this purpose. Instead, we should be using the `is_integer_dtype()` method to check if the index is of integer type.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer_dtype():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code fixes the issue by using the correct methods for checking whether the index is of integer type. It should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
