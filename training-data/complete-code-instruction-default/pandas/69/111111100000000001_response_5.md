The potential error is located in the if-else condition inside the for loop of the `_convert_key` function. The function is trying to compare if the index is an integer and then making a comparison based on that. However, the comparison logic seems to be incorrect and is causing the ValueError to be raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be revised to accurately check the type of the index and the type of the indexer being passed.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # this is the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not isinstance(ax, (pd.Int64Index, pd.Float64Index)) and isinstance(i, (int, np.integer, float, np.floating)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` functions have been replaced with `isinstance` checks to compare the types accurately. The comparisons have been revised to check if the index is an instance of `pd.Int64Index` or `pd.Float64Index`, and if the indexer is an instance of `int`, `np.integer`, or `float`, `np.floating` as per the requirement of the function.

By updating the comparison logic, we ensure that the correct type checks are applied and the ValueError is raised only when the conditions are not met as per the intended functionality of the function.
