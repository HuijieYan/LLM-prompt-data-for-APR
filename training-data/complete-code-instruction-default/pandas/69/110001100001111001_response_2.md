The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the types of the input key when checking against the axis, resulting in incorrect value type comparisons. This is causing the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the types of the key and the axis values are correctly handled and compared. We can do this by using the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods on the index objects, and converting the key to a list if it is a setter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    key = list(key)
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code ensures that the key is converted to a list if it is a setter, and then compares the types of the key and the axis values correctly using `pd.api.types.is_integer` and the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods. This way, the function will return the correct results for all the given cases.
