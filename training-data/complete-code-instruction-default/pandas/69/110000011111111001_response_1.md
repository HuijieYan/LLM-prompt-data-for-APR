The issue with the _convert_key function seems to be that the check for whether a key is an integer is flawed. In some cases, it is checking the type of the index (e.g., the dtype of self.obj) instead of the type of the key. This is causing a ValueError to be raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function should directly check the type of the key against the type of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.Int64Index):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, float) and not isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.Float64Index):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing tests, as it directly checks the type of the key against the type of the index, ensuring that only integer keys are used for integer indexes and non-integer keys for non-integer indexes.
