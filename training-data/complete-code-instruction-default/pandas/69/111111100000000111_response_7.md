1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `_AtIndexer` class in the file pandas/core/indexing.py. The function is used to convert keys to the same type as the index to prevent fallback. The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements where it checks for the type of the index and the key. These conditional statements are likely causing the issue.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional statements inside the `_convert_key` function are not correctly handling the index type and the type of keys being provided. This is leading to incorrect behavior when performing Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

4. To fix the bug, we can refactor the conditional statements to properly handle the index type and the type of keys being provided. Additionally, we can add proper error handling and validation to ensure that the function behaves as expected for all cases.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = [key]
    else:
        idx_type = type(self.obj.index)
        if idx_type == pd.Float64Index:
            if not isinstance(key, float):
                raise ValueError("Index type is Float64 but key is not a float")
        elif idx_type == pd.DatetimeIndex:
            if not isinstance(key, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError("Index type is DatetimeIndex but key is not a Timestamp")
        # Add more conditions for other index types as needed

    return key
```

This corrected code includes proper handling for different index types and their respective key types, and it also includes error handling for different cases. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
