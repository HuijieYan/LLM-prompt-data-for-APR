The problematic function is `_convert_key` within the `_AtIndexer` class. The function is used in the at indexer method and it is failing when trying to set a non-integer index using the 'at' accessor. The error message states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers." This indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexes correctly and is raising an error when it should not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes. This includes removing the check that raises an error for non-integer indexes.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    return key
```

This modified function removes the unnecessary checks for integer and non-integer indexes and simply returns the key as is. This should resolve the error in the failing test and allow the at indexer to work correctly.
