The problematic function is `_convert_key` in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The function is used to convert keys into the same type as the index. However, there is an issue with the type checking and conversion process, which is causing the failing test.

The failing test is related to index lookups for datetime and timedelta-like values. The error message indicates that the function is raising a `ValueError` due to an issue with based indexing on non-integer indexes. This error is caused by incorrect type checking and handling of keys within the `_convert_key` function.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that there are corner cases affecting Series lookups for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the failing test scenario.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should be modified to correctly handle the type checking and conversion of keys. The function should account for different index types, such as datetime and timedelta indexes, and perform appropriate type checking to ensure compatibility.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle datetime and timedelta-like index types separately. It should check if the index is a datetime or timedelta index and perform type checking and conversion accordingly. Additionally, the function should handle non-integer indexers correctly to avoid the `ValueError` that is being raised.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) or isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Datetime and timedelta based indexing can only have datetime or timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function includes separate handling for datetime and timedelta indexes and also correctly checks for non-integer indexers. It should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
