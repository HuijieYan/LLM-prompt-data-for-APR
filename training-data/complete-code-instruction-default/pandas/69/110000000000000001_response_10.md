1. The buggy function is supposed to convert the key to the same type as the index. If it is a setter, it converts the key to a list. Otherwise, it loops through the axes and checks for integer values. If the axis is an integer, it checks if the key is also an integer and vice versa.

2. The potential error is the incorrect use of the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods, and the incorrect conditional statements for checking the indexes.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods. Additionally, the conditional statements for checking the indexes are not properly handling the cases.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using the correct method to check if the value is an integer.
   - Correcting the conditional statements to properly handle the cases.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
