The issue in the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the input types. It should check if the input types are integers or non-integers, and raise ValueError accordingly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditionals for checking the type of the input indexers.

The bug's cause is that the function is not checking the type of input indexers correctly. It is not handling integer and non-integer input indexers properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to check for integer and non-integer input indexers for both the integer and non-integer axis.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) or i != int(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code checks the type of input indexers and raises ValueError if the types are not as per the defined rules. The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
