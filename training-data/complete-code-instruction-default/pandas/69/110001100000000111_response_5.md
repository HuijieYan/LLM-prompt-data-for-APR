The potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error in the problematic function is the condition checks within the for loop, where it is trying to compare whether the index is an integer or not.

Bug's cause:
The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly comparing the type of index and raising ValueError inappropriately.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct method to check if the index is an integer or not.
2. Use appropriate conditional checks to determine the type of index and return the correct result accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an index of type {type(ax)} "
                    "can only have indexers of type int or float"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by properly checking the type of the index and the type of the key, and then raising the ValueError accordingly. It also takes into account the different types of indexes and handles the conversion of keys appropriately.
