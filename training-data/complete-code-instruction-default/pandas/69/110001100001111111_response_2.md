The buggy function `_convert_key` is designed to convert the keys to the same type as the index. However, the implementation does not handle the conversion properly for the Float64Index or when dealing with integer and non-integer indexes.

The issue reported on GitHub describes how Series lookups are affected, indicating that the bug affects the functionality of the `get_value` method for Float64Index.

The root cause of the bug lies in the inconsistent handling of integer and non-integer indexes in the function.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle the different types of indexes and ensure that the keys are correctly converted to match the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta "
                    "index can only have datetime or timedelta "
                    "indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code handles the different types of indexes, such as Float64Index, DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex, and ensures that the keys are correctly matched with the index type. This should resolve the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub.
