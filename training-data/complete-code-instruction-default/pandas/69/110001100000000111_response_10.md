1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index and also checks for the type of index and key for integer and non-integer types by iterating through the axes and corresponding keys.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the loop that checks for the type of index and key.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the case when the index is a Float64Index and is not checking for the Float64Index type. This is causing issues with series lookups for the Float64Index case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check for Float64Index type in the loop that iterates through the axes and corresponding keys
   - Ensuring that the function properly handles the case when the index is a Float64Index

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function includes a specific check for `pd.Float64Index` type and ensures that it properly handles the case when the index is a Float64Index. This fixes the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
