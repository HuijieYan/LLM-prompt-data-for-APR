The `self.obj.axes` attribute returns a list of Index objects. In the `_convert_key` function, it iterates over the axes and the corresponding key, checking if the axis is an integer, and then evaluates whether the key aligns with the type of index. The function is designed to ensure that the key has the same type as the index, but it's encountering problems with non-integer index and integer key combinations. This is leading to a `ValueError` being raised when encountering non-integer indexes with integer keys.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer index and integer key combinations.

One approach for fixing the bug is to add a condition to check if the index is non-integer, and if the key is an integer. If this is the case, we can convert the key to the same type as the index, ensuring alignment. We can also refactor the code to make it more readable.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:  # if the index is non-integer
            if is_integer(i):  # and the key is an integer
                # convert the key to the same type as the index
                i = ax._convert_arr_indexer(i)
        return key
```

This modified function includes a condition to handle the case where the index is non-integer and the key is an integer. It calls `_convert_arr_indexer` to convert the key to the same type as the index, ensuring compatibility.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
