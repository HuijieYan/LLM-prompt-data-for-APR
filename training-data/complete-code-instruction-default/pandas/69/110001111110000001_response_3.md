The problematic function `_convert_key` is called during indexing and slicing of a pandas DataFrame. The error is caused due to the bug in the `_convert_key` function.

The problematic function tries to convert the key based on the type of index and raises a `ValueError` if the key type is inappropriate for the index. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is meant to check if datetime64 or timedelta64 values are wrapped correctly and indexed properly, but it encounters a `ValueError` due to the bug in the `_convert_key` function.

The `ValueError` is raised when the condition `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer()` is true. This condition is not handling the integer indexing correctly based on specific index types.

The bug can be fixed by revising the condition that raises the `ValueError` in the `_convert_key` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition to check for the appropriate type of index and handle integer indexing accordingly.
2. Use a more generic approach that can handle different types of indices.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function handles both integer and non-integer indexing based on the type of the index, and it should pass the failing test.
