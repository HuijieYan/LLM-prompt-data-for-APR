The buggy function is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index, and it has a conditional check for allowing arbitrary setting. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic inside the for loop where it checks for integer-based indexing and non-integer based indexing.

The bug's cause is related to the conditional checks for integer and non-integer indexing within the for loop. The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" implies that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, suggesting that the bug might be related to the conversion of key to the same type as the index in these cases.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for integer and non-integer indexing need to be revisited, as well as a review of how the key is converted for the specific case of series lookups with Float64Index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function including the fix patch:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code includes a fix for the conditional checks, specifically checking for Int64Index and Float64Index and ensuring that the key is converted appropriately. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
