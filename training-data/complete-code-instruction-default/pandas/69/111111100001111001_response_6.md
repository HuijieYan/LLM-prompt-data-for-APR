The bug in the _convert_key function is that it is not correctly checking if a value is an integer or not and is not handling different types of indexes (i.e., integer vs non-integer). The function is failing to check for non-integer indexers when the index is an integer index.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _convert_key function to correctly handle integer and non-integer indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (Int64Index, Float64Index)):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function correctly checks the type and the indexer type based on the type of index being used. The modified code should now pass all the expected test cases given.
