The buggy function `_convert_key` is intended to require that keys match the type of the index. It checks if the input `key` is an integer or not based on the type of the index and raises a `ValueError` if it doesn't match. However, the current implementation has issues with handling integer and non-integer cases properly.

The discrepancies in the expected and actual output variable value occur due to the incorrect handling of integer and non-integer cases in the function. This is causing the bug in the Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to properly handle integer and non-integer cases based on the type of the index. This can be achieved by checking the type of the index and the type of the input key. If they don't match, a `ValueError` should be raised.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64 index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Datetime index can only have Datetime indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Timedelta index can only have Timedelta indexers"
                )
    
    return key
```

This corrected function properly handles the integer and non-integer cases based on the type of the index. It checks the type of the index and the type of the input key and raises a `ValueError` if they don't match. This should fix the bug and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
