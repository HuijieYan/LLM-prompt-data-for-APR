1. The buggy function is responsible for converting the key based on the index type. It is related to the indexing functionality in pandas.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the index type with the key type.

3. The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic for the index type and key type is not implemented correctly. When comparing the key type with the index type, the function does not handle the different types properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Implementing proper type comparison logic for non-integer index types
   - Handling the conversion of key types based on the index type more robustly

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code:
- The isinstance() function is used to check if the key type is an integer.
- The isinstance() function is also used to check if the index type is a numeric index, specifically an Int64Index.
- Proper error messages are included to provide clear information about the issue.
