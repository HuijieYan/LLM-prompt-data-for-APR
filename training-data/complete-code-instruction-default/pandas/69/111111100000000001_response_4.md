1. The buggy function _convert_key is part of the class _AtIndexer, which is a subclass of _ScalarAccessIndexer. This function is designed to convert the key to the same type as the index, with special conditions for integer indexes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that checks if the index is an integer and whether the key is an integer index. There are inconsistencies in the conditions and checks made within the function.

3. The bug's cause lies in the incorrect conditional checks for integer indexes and keys. The _convert_key function is not handling the conditions for integer indexes and keys properly. This could lead to incorrect conversions or value assignments, causing unexpected behavior in the program.

4. To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for checking integer indexes and keys. The conditions for integer indexers and non-integer indexers need to be properly defined and checked to ensure the correct type conversion of the key.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes and keys has been properly defined. The conditions are now checked for each case, ensuring that the appropriate error is thrown if the key does not match the index type. This will prevent incorrect assignments and ensure consistent behavior for the function.
