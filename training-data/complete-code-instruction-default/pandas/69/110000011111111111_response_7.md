The issue is occurring in the `_convert_key` function, which is being used by the `get_value` method of `Float64Index`. The error message indicates that an exception is being raised at the `raise ValueError` line inside the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the `else` block. This exception is related to the type of index and indexers being used.

The problem seems to be related to the handling of non-integer indexers for a non-integer index. The function is not handling non-integer indexers properly, leading to a ValueError being raised.

Based on the failing tests and the error message, it appears that the issue is with the conversion of index keys, especially with float and integer values. The failing tests also provide information about the expected type of variables at the function's return, which can be used to identify what needs to be fixed in the function.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that the bug is related to corner cases involving DTI (presumably DatetimeIndex) and Float64Index.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_convert_key` function to properly handle cases where the index and indexers are of different types (integer and float). We also need to ensure that it correctly processes non-integer indexers for a non-integer index.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    converted_key = []
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, float) and ax.is_integer() and int(i) != i:
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        
        converted_key.append(i)

    return tuple(converted_key)
```

This updated version of the `_convert_key` function should handle integer and float indexers correctly. It checks the type of index and indexers and raises a ValueError if the combination is invalid. This should address the failing tests and the GitHub issue related to the bug in `get_value` for float and integer indexers.
