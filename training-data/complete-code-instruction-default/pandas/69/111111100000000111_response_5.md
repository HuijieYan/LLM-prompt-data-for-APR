The buggy function in the _AtIndexer class within the file pandas/core/indexing.py is _convert_key(). This function is responsible for converting the key into the same type as the index, and it is used for at based indexing in pandas. The issue is related to corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value, and it affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the validation logic for the key. The function is intended to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index, but there are issues with the validation conditions and error messages.

The bug causes incorrect validation of the keys for at based indexing, potentially leading to unexpected behavior during lookups for the Float64Index case. This is the reason for the GitHub issue related to corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value being affected.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to revisit the validation logic for the keys and ensure that it correctly checks for matching types and handles the conditions for integer and non-integer indexes as per the requirements of at based indexing.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i): 
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

The corrected code includes a revised logic for validating the keys based on the type of index, and it correctly checks for matching types and handles integer and non-integer indexers according to the requirements of at based indexing.
