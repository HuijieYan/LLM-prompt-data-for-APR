Potential error location:
The potential error lies in the conditional checks for whether the index is an integer or not, as well as whether the indexer is an integer or not.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect conditional checks for integer and non-integer indexes and indexers. The code does not handle the cases properly and may lead to incorrect validation.

Approach for fixing the bug:
Update the conditional checks to properly validate whether the index and indexer are integer or non-integer.

Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # this is the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
        return key
```
