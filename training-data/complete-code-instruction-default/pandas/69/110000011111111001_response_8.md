## Bug Analysis
The function `_convert_key` is designed to handle indexing on the non-integer index and check for compatibility with integer or non-integer indexes. It currently has issues with handling non-integer indexes and is not handling them correctly based on the failing test and the error message.

The failing test is trying to index a series with non-integer keys (4 and 4.0) and it expects the function to return the values at those keys, but currently, the function raises a ValueError because of the non-integer keys.

The issue lies in the condition for checking non-integer indexers, which is not working as intended.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect check for non-integer keys within the `_convert_key` function. The function is raising a ValueError for non-integer keys even when they are valid keys for the index.

## Fixing the Bug
One possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the condition for checking non-integer indexers in the `_convert_key` function. We need to check if the indexer is a non-integer and the axis allows non-integer keys, only then it should raise a ValueError. Otherwise, it should allow non-integer keys.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking non-integer indexers needs to be updated to properly handle non-integer keys and respect the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function should handle non-integer indexers correctly, allowing valid non-integer keys and raising a ValueError only when a non-integer key is not compatible with the index.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
