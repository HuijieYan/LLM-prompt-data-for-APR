The potential error in the buggy function is in the line `if is_integer(i):`. The issue appears to be that there is no function `is_integer` being called, and this is causing the function to throw an error. 

To fix the bug, we can use the built-in `isinstance` function to check if `i` is of type `int` or `float`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, (int, float)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The corrected code uses `isinstance` to check if `i` is of type `int` or `float`, and raises a `ValueError` if it's not of the appropriate type. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all the provided test cases.
