The problematic function _convert_key has several issues. It is not properly handling the conversion of the key and is_setter, leading to incorrect behavior during key conversion. The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" points to a problem with Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case, which is likely related to this function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that checks whether the index is an integer and if the key is an integer. It appears that the conditional checks are not correctly handling the cases where the index is an integer or not, leading to incorrect results.

The bug's cause is likely related to the incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indexes and keys within the _convert_key function. This is affecting the lookup of values for Float64Index, as noted in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes and keys should be reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the handling of is_setter should be properly implemented to ensure correct key conversion in both getter and setter scenarios.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, IntegerIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, IntegerIndex):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

This corrected code properly handles the conversion of keys based on the type of the index and the type of the key, and also takes into account the is_setter parameter for setter scenarios. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
