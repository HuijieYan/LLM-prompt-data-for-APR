The issue seems to be occurring in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The error message indicates that when using `ser.at[4]`, it is raising a `ValueError` because it identifies 4 as an integer index. This is inconsistent with the behavior of `.loc` and `.iloc` functions.

The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling the scenario where an integer is passed as the key and it is expecting non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle integer indexes properly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_convert_key` function to handle integer indexes differently.
2. Check the data type of the index and ensure that the key is converted to the appropriate type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.Float64Index):
        key = [float(k) for k in key]

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected function, the issue identified in the failing test should be resolved. The `if isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.Float64Index)` condition checks if the index is of type `Float64Index`, and then ensures that the key is converted to float type. This fixes the inconsistency and resolves the issue.
