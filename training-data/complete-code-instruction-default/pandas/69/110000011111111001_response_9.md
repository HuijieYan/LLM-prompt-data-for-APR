The bug in the function is caused by the type checking logic for the index and the keys. The function is intended to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index, but the logic to handle integer and non-integer types is incorrect, leading to a ValueError being raised in cases where the test expects successful operations.

The problem occurs at the part of the code where it checks if the indexer is an integer or not. The function tries to call `ax.is_integer()` and `ax.holds_integer()`, which are not valid methods. Instead, we can use `isinstance(i, int)` and `not isinstance(i, int)` to check if the index or the key is of integer type.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `_convert_key` function as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) and not ax.is_type_compatible(int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) and ax.is_type_compatible(int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
Now this corrected function should resolve the issues and pass the failing tests. This function updates the type checking to use `isinstance` and `is_type_compatible` methods to properly handle integer and non-integer indexers. After making this change, the corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and pass all the failing tests.
