### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_convert_key` is failing due to incorrect checking of index types and values. The function is not correctly handling cases where the index type is non-integer.

The failing test is related to `get_value` and lookups for `Float64Index` and `Datetime/Timedelta` values. The error message indicates that the problem is with the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the non-integer index handling.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" outlines the problem with Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case. This aligns with the failing test and error message.

### Bug Cause
The root cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not correctly handling non-integer index cases, leading to the failing tests and error message. The function is not appropriately identifying the type of the index and validating the input key accordingly.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer index cases.
2. Add a check to validate the type of the index and ensure that the input key matches the index type.
3. Adjust the error handling to provide clear and accurate error messages.

### Corrected Code

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, np.int64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) or isinstance(i, np.int64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

### Changes Made
1. Adjusted the checks for integer and non-integer index types based on the actual index type.
2. Updated the conditions to check if the input key is an integer, and if so, only allow integer indexers for integer index types. If the input key is non-integer, then only non-integer indexers are allowed.

With these changes, the corrected function should now handle both integer and non-integer index cases properly and pass the failing tests.
