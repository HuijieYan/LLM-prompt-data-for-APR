The buggy function `_convert_key` is related to the GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" as it is used in the process of indexing and retrieving values from a Series, which is affected for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location in the problematic function is the logic inside the for loop that iterates over the axes and the key, checking for compatibility between the types of the index and the key.

The bug in the code is caused by the incorrect type checking logic within the for loop. The function is not handling the cases of integer and non-integer indexes properly, which results in the wrong error messages being raised for Float64Index.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the type checking for different index types. The logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes should be re-evaluated and modified to properly handle the cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code addresses the type checking issue by using `isinstance` to correctly check the index type and the type of the key, and raises the appropriate error messages for the cases of integer and non-integer indexes. This resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
