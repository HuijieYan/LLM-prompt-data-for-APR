The bug is caused because the function does not handle non-integer keys properly. It should raise a ValueError when an integer index has non-integer indexers, and when a non-integer index has integer indexers. Additionally, the function should be able to handle both float and integer keys.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle both float and integer keys and check for the type of index (integer or non-integer) when indexing the DataFrame. It should also raise a ValueError when there is a mismatch between the type of the index and the type of the key.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64, np.int32)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (int, np.int64, np.int32)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly handle both float and integer keys and raise a ValueError when there is a type mismatch between the index and the key. This should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
