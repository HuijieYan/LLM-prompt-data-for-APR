1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of the class `_AtIndexer` which is a part of the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index, to avoid fallback. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling different types of indexes and keys, especially when checking for integer indexers.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_convert_key` does not handle the case properly when dealing with different types of indexes and keys.
   (b). The class `_AtIndexer` is responsible for indexing and accessing elements based on scalar values.
   (c). Related functions in the same file might also be impacted by this bug.
   (d). The GitHub issue information indicates that there are corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value` that are affected by this bug.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug:
   (a). The bug can be fixed by revisiting the logic in the `_convert_key` function to handle different types of indexes and keys properly.
   (b). Proper checks and conditional statements should be added to ensure that the function can handle integer and non-integer indexes and indexers correctly.
   (c). Testing with various scenarios and edge cases to ensure that the function works as expected in all cases.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )

        return key
```

This corrected code improves the logic in the `_convert_key` function to properly handle different types of indexes and keys. It includes conditional statements to check for integer and non-integer indexers and raises appropriate value errors if the conditions are not met. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug by ensuring that series lookups for the Float64Index case are handled correctly.
