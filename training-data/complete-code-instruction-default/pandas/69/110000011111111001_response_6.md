The issue with the problematic function is that it is not correctly checking whether the index and the key have compatible types. The function checks for integer types and non-integer types, but it does not properly handle float types which may be present in the key. This causes a ValueError to be raised when the index and key have non-integer types, even if they may be compatible float types.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle float types in the key. The function should be able to handle float keys where the index also contains float values.

Here is the corrected and improved version of the function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_floating():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64, float, np.float64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a floating point index "
                    "can only have integer or floating point indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (str, np.str_)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer and non-floating index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The changes made to the function include an additional check for floating point types in the index, as well as allowing both integer and float values in the key when the index contains floating point values. This modification ensures that the function can handle float keys when the index also contains float values.

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
