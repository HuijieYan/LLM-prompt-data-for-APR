The issue is with the `_convert_key` function from the `_AtIndexer` class in the pandas/core/indexing.py file. The function is designed to require keys to be of the same type as the index. However, the condition to check if the key is an integer is flawed, leading to a ValueError.

The issue arises due to the `is_integer()` and `is_integer(i)` comparison, as well as the `holds_integer()` function. These functions are not standard Python or pandas functions, which is causing the ValueError.

To fix the bug, you can modify the condition checks within the `_convert_key` function and use the `np.issubdtype` function to check if the key is of the same type as the index. Additionally, you can remove the non-standard `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` functions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = self.obj.axes[0].dtype
    if not np.issubdtype(type(key[0]), index_type):
        raise ValueError(
            "At based indexing on an index of type "
            "can only have keys of the same type"
        )

    return key
```
In this corrected code, I assume the index type is the same for all axes. If not, you may need to iterate through all axes to verify the key type for each one.

This fix will ensure that the function checks if the key is of the same type as the index and raises a ValueError if it isn't.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
