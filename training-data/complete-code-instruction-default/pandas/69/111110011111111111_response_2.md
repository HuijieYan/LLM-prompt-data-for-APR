The cause of the bug is that the '_convert_key' function is not handling both integer and non-integer indexes properly. This is resulting in a ValueError being raised for the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the '_convert_key' function to handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly. We can do this by updating the logic to check the type of the index and the type of the key being passed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int) and i != int(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly and pass the failing test cases.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the Series lookups affected for the Float64Index case.
