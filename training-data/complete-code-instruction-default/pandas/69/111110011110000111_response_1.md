Upon analyzing the buggy function, class, test code, error message, and GitHub issue, we can identify the potential error location in the `_convert_key` function.

The error is caused because the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer cases correctly. It is failing to raise a ValueError when a non-integer index is passed to the `ser.at[4]` method, leading to an error in the test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Adding a condition to explicitly check for non-integer cases and raise a ValueError.
2. Modifying the logic to handle non-integer cases appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    # Corrected _convert_key function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
