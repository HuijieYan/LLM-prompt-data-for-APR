Potential error location: The key conversion process and the conditions within the loop to check for integer indexing and non-integer indexing.

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by the incorrect conditions within the loop that are meant to check for integer and non-integer indexing. The conditions are comparing the index types incorrectly, leading to incorrect validation.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
- Revise the conditions within the loop to correctly check for integer and non-integer indexing based on the type of the index and the type of the key.
- Use the appropriate methods or functions to determine the type of the index and the key, and then apply the validation conditions accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):


    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```
In the corrected code, the conditions within the loop have been revised to correctly check for integer and non-integer indexing based on the type of the index and the type of the key. The `is_integer` method and `isinstance` function are used to determine the types and apply the validation conditions accordingly.
