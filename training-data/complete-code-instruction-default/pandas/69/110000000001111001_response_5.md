The issue in the buggy function is that it does not handle cases where the key and the indexes are different types correctly. It attempts to validate the key based on the types of the index, but it does not correctly handle cases where the types are not the same.

A possible fix for this function would be to explicitly check the types of the key and the index, and then perform the appropriate validation based on the types.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, np.datetime64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, np.timedelta64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not type(i) == type(ax[0]):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an index of type {type(ax[0])} can only have {type(ax[0])} indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In this corrected code, we explicitly check the type of the index (datetime or timedelta) and then validate the key based on its type. If the key and index are not of the same types, a ValueError is raised. This should address the issue and satisfy the provided test cases.
