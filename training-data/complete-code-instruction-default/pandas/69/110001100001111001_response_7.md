The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly checks whether an indexer is an integer, which leads to incorrect validation checks. The function should instead check whether the indexer and the index are of the same type.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the type of the indexer with the type of the index, rather than checking for integer values. Additionally, the function should raise a TypeError instead of a ValueError when the types do not match.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if type(i) != type(ax[0]):
            raise TypeError(
                "At based indexing requires indexers to have the same type as the index"
            )
    return key
```
