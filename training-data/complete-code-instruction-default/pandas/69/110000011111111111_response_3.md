### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_convert_key` is supposed to handle different types of keys based on the indexes in the pandas Series. The failing test is related to the `get_value` method of the Float64Index. The error message indicates that the bug is specifically related to the non-integer indexed keys.

The function is failing because it is not handling the case of non-integer indexers properly, leading to a ValueError being raised. This is causing the failing test case related to non-integer keys.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function is not checking for non-integer indexers properly, causing a ValueError to be raised when using non-integer keys in certain cases involving the Float64Index.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexers for the Float64Index case. We need to update the logic to properly check and handle non-integer indexers in a way that satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Code
```python
# this is the corrected and fixed function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)) and not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.datetime64):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a datetime/timedelta index can only have datetime/timedelta indexers"
            )
        
    return key
```

This corrected code includes additional logic to handle the specific case of Float64Index and non-integer indexers, as well as considering datetime/timedelta indexers.

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, this fix should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
