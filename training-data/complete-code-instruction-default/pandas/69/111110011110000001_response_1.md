The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the class `_AtIndexer`, which is inheriting from the `_ScalarAccessIndexer` class. The failing test is trying to access a non-integer index using an integer key, which should raise a `ValueError` because "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This is precisely the error message being generated during the failing test.

The root cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function within the `_AtIndexer` class is not performing the correct index type validation for at-based indexing. It should check if the key type matches the type of the index.

The possible approach for fixing this bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly verify that the key type matches the index type.

Here is the corrected version of the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

By updating the `_convert_key` function to perform the correct index type validation, it will resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
