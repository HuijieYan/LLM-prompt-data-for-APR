The problematic function is `_convert_key` which is a part of the class `_AtIndexer`. The bugs in this function are caused by incorrect comparisons and type checking logic. The function tries to convert the given `key` into a suitable format for indexing, but it fails to correctly handle different types of keys (integer and non-integer).

The main issue lies in the type checking logic and comparisons in the function. The conditions for checking if the index and key are integers have errors, and the function should handle these conditions differently. The logic currently leads to incorrect comparisons and error raising, resulting in buggy behavior.

To fix the bug, the correct type checking and comparison logic needs to be implemented. The function should handle integer and non-integer keys differently based on the type of the index.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax[0], int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected function now correctly checks the type of the key values and raises errors accordingly. It first checks if the index is an integer type, and then compares the key values based on this information. This new logic will handle both integer and non-integer indexes and keys correctly.
