Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function is in the if condition where it checks for the type of the index and the type of the indexer.

Bug Cause:
The bug is causing issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case. The function is not handling the indexing properly, leading to incorrect results for Float64Index.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. We need to check if the index is of type float and the indexer is also of type float64. If they are not, then raise a ValueError.
2. We need to handle the Float64Index case specifically to ensure proper indexing and lookup for this type of index.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, np.float64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Float64Index can only have float64 indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, type(ax[0])):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"{type(ax)} can only have {type(ax[0])} indexers"
                )
    return key
```
