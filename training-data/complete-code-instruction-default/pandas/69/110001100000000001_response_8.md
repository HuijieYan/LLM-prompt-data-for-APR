The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if ax.is_integer():`. This statement seems to be checking if the index is of integer type or not, but it could be causing issues due to its ambiguous implementation.

The bug's cause is that the condition `if ax.is_integer():` is not a valid attribute or method for the object `ax`. This leads to a AttributeError because the `is_integer` function does not exist for the object `ax`.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `is_integer()` method directly on the index rather than on the axis object `ax`. This will ensure that we are checking the type of the index correctly.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.dtype.kind == 'i':
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and ax.dtype.kind != 'i':
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected code, we are using the `dtype.kind` attribute to check if the index is of integer type or not, and then using `isinstance()` to verify the type of the indexer. This ensures that the code correctly checks the types and raises a ValueError if the conditions are not met.
