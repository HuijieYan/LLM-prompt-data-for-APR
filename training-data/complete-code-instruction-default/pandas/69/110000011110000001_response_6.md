The `at` method in the failing test is calling the `_convert_key` method, which is trying to validate the keys and raising a `ValueError` when the condition fails. The error message indicates that the error is in the `else` part of `_convert_key` method where it checks if the index is non-integer.

Upon analyzing the error message, it seems that when `ser.at[4]` is called, it's trying to access an index that is not an integer, causing the `ValueError` to be raised. 

To fix the bug:
- We need to modify the `_convert_key` method to handle the case where the index is a specific type, without raising a `ValueError`.
- The modification will involve adding a check to see whether the index is non-integer and handle it accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                i = int(i)
        return key
```
Note: The code above is a corrected version of the `_convert_key` method. It includes a check to handle the case where the index is non-integer. We handle this case by converting the index to an integer before returning the key.
