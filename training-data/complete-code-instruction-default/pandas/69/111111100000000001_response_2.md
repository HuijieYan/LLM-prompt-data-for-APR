The buggy function is `_convert_key` which is part of the `_AtIndexer` class. This function is used to require the keys to be the same type as the index so that there is no fallback. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional check for integer keys and the type of the index.

The bug's cause could be that the function is not handling the cases properly where the type of index and key does not match, and the conditional checks are not accurate.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the conditional checks for integer keys and the type of the index. Also, it is necessary to handle the cases where the types of index and key do not match properly.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):




    # corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, the conditional checks for integer keys and the type of the index have been modified to use the `isinstance` method for accurately checking the types. Additionally, the cases where the types of index and key do not match are properly handled.
