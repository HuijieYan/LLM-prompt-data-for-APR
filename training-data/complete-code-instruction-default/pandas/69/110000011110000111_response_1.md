**Analysis:**
The buggy function `_convert_key` seems to have an issue with integer and non-integer indices. The failing test is related to the `get_value` method, and the error message indicates a ValueError related to non-integer indexing.

**Bug Cause:**
The `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indices properly, leading to a ValueError when trying to access values using non-integer keys.

**Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:**
1. Update the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indices correctly.
2. Check for non-integer indices and handle them based on the index type.
3. Ensure that the conversion of keys does not lead to a ValueError in corner cases.

**Corrected Code:**
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By updating the logic inside the `_convert_key` function to handle integer and non-integer indices appropriately, the bug should be fixed. This correction should also address the issue reported in the GitHub repository.
