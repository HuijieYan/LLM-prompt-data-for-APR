The buggy function `_convert_key` takes two parameters: `key` and `is_setter`. The function iterates through `self.obj.axes` and the `key` and raises a ValueError if the conditions are not met. The failing test is testing the behavior of indexing with non-integer and integer indices. The error message indicates that the issue is related to non-integer indexing.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect logic in the condition check for non-integer indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):  # Check for non-integer indexers
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By updating the condition to check for non-integer indexers instead of checking for integer indexers, we ensure that the function handles non-integer indexers correctly.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the ValueError related to non-integer indexing.
