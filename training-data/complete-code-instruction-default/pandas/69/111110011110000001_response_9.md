The buggy function `_convert_key` appears to be designed to ensure that keys and indexes are of the same type. It's likely that the error is being caused by the logic used to check the type of the key compared to the type of the index. 

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` utilizes this function with a series of datetime and timedelta values, and is failing checks when the input key is an integer while the index is a non-integer.

To fix this bug, the function would need to be updated to correctly handle the case where the key and the index have different types.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to check whether the key and the index have different types, and adjust the key accordingly.

Here's a possible fixed version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, or adjust the key accordingly.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        # Convert key to index type if key and index types don't match
        if type(i) != type(ax):
            i = ax._map(i)  # Convert key to index type

        # Validate the with the corrected key
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This version of the function checks if the key and index have different types, and if so, adjusts the key to match the index type. This should fix the failing test and resolve the identified bug.
