The bug in the _convert_key function is that it doesn't handle the case when the index is of type float and the key is an integer. The function raises a ValueError in this case, which is not expected behavior.

The failing test is checking the behavior of lookups on a Float64Index and is expecting the resulting values to match the expected values. However, the test is failing due to the ValueError being raised in the _convert_key function.

The error message indicates that the ValueError is raised when attempting to perform based indexing on a non-integer index with an integer indexer.

The GitHub issue title reflects the scope of the bug, which affects corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value.

To fix the bug, the _convert_key function needs to be modified to handle the case when the index is of type float and the key is an integer. Instead of raising a ValueError, it should cast the key to the same type as the index.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    new_key = []
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and isinstance(i, int):
            i = float(i)
        new_key.append(i)

    return tuple(new_key)
```

With this correction, the _convert_key function will handle the case when the index is of type float and the key is an integer, casting the key to float as necessary.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
