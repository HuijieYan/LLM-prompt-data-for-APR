Potential error location: The error is likely to be in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the `is_integer(i)` and `ax.holds_integer()` conditions.

Bug's cause:
The error message indicates that there is an issue related to "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers." This suggests that there is a problem with the conditional checks for integer and non-integer indexers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the correct data type and conditions for integer and non-integer indexers.
2. Adjust the conditional checks to handle the indexing appropriately.

Let's fix the bug in the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
  
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
               raise ValueError(
                   "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
               )
    return key
```

By making these changes, the `_convert_key` function should be able to handle the conditions for integer and non-integer indexers correctly and pass the failing test.
