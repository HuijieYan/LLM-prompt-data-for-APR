Potential error location within the problematic function: 

The potential error in the _convert_key function lies in the conditional checks for is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer(). These conditionals are not properly checking for the index type and could lead to incorrect validations.

Bug's cause:

The _convert_key function is responsible for converting the key based on the index type, but the conditional checks are not properly validating the index type, leading to potential errors.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks to accurately validate the index type and ensure that the appropriate error messages are raised when necessary.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    # The corrected _convert_key function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # Allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```
In the corrected code, the conditional checks have been updated to use isinstance(i, int) to accurately determine the index type and raise ValueError with the appropriate error messages.
