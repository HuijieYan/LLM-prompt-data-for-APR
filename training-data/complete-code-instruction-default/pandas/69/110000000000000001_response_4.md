1. The buggy function is a method that is meant to convert a key into a suitable format. It checks whether the key is the same type as the index and returns a list of the key if it's a setter.

2. The potential error location is within the for loop where it checks the type of the index.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the is_integer() and is_integer() functions, as well as the improper handling of index types.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to properly check the type of the index and handle integer and non-integer indexes separately. Additionally, the use of the correct functions for checking the type of the index should be ensured.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we have used `isinstance()` function to correctly check the type of the index, and we have also handled integer and non-integer indexes separately based on the axis type. Additionally, we replaced `is_integer()` with `isinstance()` to accurately check the type of the index.
