The issue lies in the `_convert_key` function where it is not correctly handling the case when a non-integer index is being used with an integer indexer. This is causing the ValueError to be raised in the failing test.

The failing test is testing lookups for different types of indexes and values, and it expects the `get_value` method to behave correctly. However, due to the bug in the `_convert_key` function, it is not handling non-integer indexes properly.

The GitHub issue describes that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the failing test and error message.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when a non-integer index is being used with an integer indexer. The function should be able to handle different types of indexes and values properly without raising a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, so we can handle different types of indexes and values properly.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    # check for non-integer indexes with integer indexers
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected `_convert_key` function, it should be able to handle different types of indexes and values properly. This updated function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
