The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for whether the index and the key are the same type. This is causing problems when dealing with non-integer indexes and integer keys, and vice versa. 

The bug's cause seems to be related to the function's inability to handle cases where the index and keys are of different data types.

To fix the bug, the _convert_key function should be modified to handle cases where the index and keys are of different data types. It should check if the index and key are compatible, rather than the same type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be compatible with the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
