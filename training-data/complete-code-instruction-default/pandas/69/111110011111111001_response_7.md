The issue is with the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class. The function is not handling non-integer index properly, and it's throwing a ValueError for non-integer indexes.

To fix the issue, we can update the `_convert_key` function to handle both integer and non-integer indexes appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key

```

Now, the `key` is checked appropriately based on the type of the index, and the function no longer throws a ValueError for non-integer indexes.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
