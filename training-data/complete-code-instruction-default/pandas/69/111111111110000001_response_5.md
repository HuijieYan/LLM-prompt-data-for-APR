The buggy function is `_convert_key` and it's related to the `AtIndexer` class, which is a part of the `IndexingMixin` module. The function is used to convert keys and perform validation. The error message indicates that there is an issue with indexing when the input is non-integer.

The issue occurs due to the validation inside the `_convert_key` function. When the input key is non-integer and the corresponding axis is not holding an integer, it raises a `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, the validation logic needs to be updated to handle non-integer inputs properly.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key` is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This fixes the bug by checking if the axis is non-integer and the input is non-integer, in which case it will raise an error. This resolves the issue of non-integer indexing.

With this fix, the `_convert_key` function will no longer raise a `ValueError` when non-integer inputs are used for non-integer indexes.
