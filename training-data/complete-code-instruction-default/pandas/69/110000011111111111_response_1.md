The buggy function `_convert_key` is causing errors in the `Float64Index` lookups for both `datetime64` and `timedelta64` cases, as indicated by the failing test and error message. The function is supposed to handle indexing on an integer index and non-integer index, but it fails to do so.

The error occurs because the function checks if the index is an integer, but fails to correctly identify whether the key is an integer or not. This leads to a `ValueError` being raised in the failing test scenarios when the incorrect type of index is checked.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" provides a detailed description of the problem, indicating that series lookups are affected for the `Float64Index` case.

To fix the bug, the function `_convert_key` needs to correctly identify the type of key and index and handle the cases of integer and non-integer indexes appropriately. This can be achieved by modifying the logic within the function to accurately check the types and raise the `ValueError` only when necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
With the corrected code, the function now correctly checks the type of the index and key, and raises a `ValueError` only when there's a mismatch in types.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue reported in the corresponding GitHub bug.
