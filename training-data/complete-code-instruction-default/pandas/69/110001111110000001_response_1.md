1. The buggy function is a part of the indexing functionality in the Pandas library. The failing test is related to using datetime64 or timedelta64 values and attempting to convert them to 4.0 (float64). The error message indicates that while trying to perform the operation, a ValueError is raised as the indexing is not behaving as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic to validate and convert keys based on the data type of the index.

3. The bug's cause is that the indexing logic is not handling float64 as an index effectively and is raising a ValueError. The failing test tries to access the value at index 4, and this operation fails.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Update the `_convert_key` function to handle the conversion and validation of keys based on the data type of the index more effectively.
   (b). Ensure that the function addresses the possibility of using float64 values for indexing.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function: 
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
