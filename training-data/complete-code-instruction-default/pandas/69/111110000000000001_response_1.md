Potential Error Location: The potential error is located in the `for` loop where it checks if the index matches the type of the corresponding axis.

Bug's Cause:
The bug occurs because the function is not correctly checking the type of the index against the type of the corresponding axis.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add checks to ensure that the index matches the type of the corresponding axis.
2. Raise appropriate ValueError if the index does not match the type of the corresponding axis.

The Corrected Code:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):  # Check if the index is of type integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():  # Check if the index is of type non-integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
