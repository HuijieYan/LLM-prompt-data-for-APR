The buggy function `_convert_key` is failing because it checks whether the keys are the same type as the index but it does not handle the case of non-integer indexers for float indices.

The failing test checks for specific values using different index access methods (e.g., `ser.at[4]`) and expects the correct result. However, the current implementation of `_convert_key` does not handle non-integer indexers for float indices properly, leading to a ValueError.

The GitHub issue describes the bug as affecting Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to handle non-integer indexers for float indices properly and prevent the ValueError from being raised when non-integer indexers are used.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, or handle non-integer indexers for float indices.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_floating() and not is_integer(i):
                if not is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass and the issue described in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
