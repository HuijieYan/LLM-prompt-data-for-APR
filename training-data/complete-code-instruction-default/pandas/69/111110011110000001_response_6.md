The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class within the pandas library. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` is raising a `ValueError` due to an issue in the `_convert_key` function. The error message indicates that the problem is related to integer and non-integer indexers. 

The issue appears to stem from the way the function handles integer and non-integer indexers when used with the `at` based indexing. The `for` loop within the `_convert_key` function is not correctly handling integer and non-integer indexers when checking their respective types and the error is raised when this condition is violated.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_convert_key` function to properly handle integer and non-integer indexers based on the corresponding axes. 

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code updates the condition checks to use `pd.api.types.is_integer` to properly handle integer and non-integer indexers. This will ensure that the function handles integer and non-integer indexers correctly and passes the failing test.
