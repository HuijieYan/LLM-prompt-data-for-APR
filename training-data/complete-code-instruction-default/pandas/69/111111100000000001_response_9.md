The potential error in the given function is in the for loop where it iterates through the axes of the object and checks if they are integers. This loop appears to be checking the types of the keys against the types of the index, but there is a mix-up in the logic.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. The function should correctly check if the types of the keys are compatible with the index and raise appropriate errors if not.
2. Additionally, there is a mix-up in the logic involving integer and non-integer types, which needs to be fixed for the function to work correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return key

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code:
1. It correctly checks the type of the keys against the type of the index.
2. Raises a ValueError if the types do not match.
3. Corrected the logic to handle integer and non-integer indexers appropriately.
