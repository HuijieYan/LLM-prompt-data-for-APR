The buggy function is a method named `_convert_key` which is intended to convert keys to be the same type as the index. The function contains logic to handle setter type keys and then iterates through the axes to check if the key and axis are of the same type.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case. This indicates that the bug is likely related to the method not properly handling float type indexes.

The potential error location within the function is the section where it checks the type of the index and the key. It is likely that there is a bug in this section that causes it to handle float64 indexes incorrectly.

The bug is likely caused by the function not properly handling float64 indexes, leading to incorrect behavior when performing series lookups for this index type.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle float64 indexes. Additionally, the logic for checking the type of the index and key needs to be revised to ensure it correctly handles all types of indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on a float64 index can only have float indexers, got {type(i).__name__}"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers, got {type(i).__name__}"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, str):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on a non-integer and non-float index can only have string indexers, got {type(i).__name__}"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code adds type checking for each type of index and updates the error message to include the actual type of the indexer. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
