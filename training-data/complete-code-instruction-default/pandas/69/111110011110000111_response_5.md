### Buggy function analysis:

The `_convert_key` function is part of the `_AtIndexer` class and it is used to convert keys to the same type as the index. The error message indicates that there is an issue with "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

### Error location:

The error is likely occurring in the block of code that checks if the index is non-integer and then checks if the indexers are non-integer.

### Bug cause:

The error occurs when conducting "At based indexing on a non-integer index" and using an integer indexer.

### Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the scenario of non-integer indexing on a non-integer index.

### Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(ax):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code includes modifications to the comparison checks within the for loop to properly handle the scenario described by the failing test and error message.
