The buggy function has an error in the validation logic for non-integer indexes. The check for non-integer indexes is incorrect, leading to a ValueError being raised incorrectly.

The issue seems to be with the validation logic for non-integer indexes. The `is_integer` and `holds_integer` checks are not being applied correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the issue, you need to adjust the logic for non-integer index validation. Additionally, the validation should only occur for non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function addresses the issue by checking for non-integer indexes and validating the indexers accordingly. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
