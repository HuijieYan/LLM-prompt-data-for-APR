The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to convert the input key for indexing based on certain conditions. However, it is not handling the case when the input key contains floating-point numbers for `At` based indexing. Due to this, it results in a `ValueError` when an attempt is made to do `At` based indexing on a non-integer index with an integer index.

The issue is located in the for loop within the `_convert_key` function. It is not handling the case when the key is a floating-point number.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle floating-point numbers appropriately when checking for integer or non-integer indexes. It should allow floating-point numbers when doing `At` based indexing on non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```

This corrected version of the function now checks for whether the index is integer or non-integer, and based on that, it allows appropriate indexing with integer or non-integer values. This should address the issue and make the function work as intended.
