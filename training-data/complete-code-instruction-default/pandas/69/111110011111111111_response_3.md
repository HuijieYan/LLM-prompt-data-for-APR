The buggy function `_convert_key` is designed to ensure that keys are the same type as the index. However, it is incorrectly raising a `ValueError` for non-integer indexes even though the values being passed are compatible with the index type.

The root cause of the issue is that the function is incorrectly handling non-integer indexes. This is leading to a `ValueError` being raised when it's not necessary, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes. The function needs to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index, without raising unnecessary errors for compatible types.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the logic within the `_convert_key` function to handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly. This can be done by checking the type of the index and the keys, and applying appropriate validation based on the compatibility between them.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    # Corrected version of the _convert_key function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # Allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected code should now handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly, ensuring that the keys are of the same type as the index. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, this fix should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
