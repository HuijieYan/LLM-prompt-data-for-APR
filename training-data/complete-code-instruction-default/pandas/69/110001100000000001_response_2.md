1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index. It checks the type of index and key and raises a ValueError if they do not match.

2. The potential error is in the section where it checks if the index is an integer and if the key is also an integer, and vice versa.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of functions. The `is_integer` method is not being called on the `ax` object and `is_integer(i)` is not a valid function call. 

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the correct method to check if the index is an integer and to use the correct function to check if the key is an integer. Additionally, the use of `ax.holds_integer()` should be corrected to the appropriate method.

5. Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, `is_integer()` has been replaced with `isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index)` to check if the index is an integer index and `is_integer(i)` has been replaced with `isinstance(i, int)` to check if the key is an integer. Additionally, `ax.holds_integer()` has been replaced with `isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index)` to check if the index holds integers.
