2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the condition `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer()`, where the logic is checking if `i` is an integer and if the axis does not hold an integer.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the condition `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer()` is not correctly handling the case where `i` is an integer and the axis does not hold an integer. This is leading to the ValueError being raised erroneously.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Adjust the condition `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer()` to handle the case where `i` is an integer and the axis does not hold an integer correctly.
   - Review the logic to ensure that it accurately represents the requirements for the indexing operation.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandes/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    # this is the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
With this correction, the function should now accurately handle the key conversion based on the index and resolve the issue reported in the failing test.
