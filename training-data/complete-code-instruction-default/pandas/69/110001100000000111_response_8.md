Potential error location: The error occurs when checking if the key is an integer within the for loop. The function uses is_integer() and is_integer() functions, but these are not defined within the function and could potentially cause the error.

Bug's cause: The bug is causing issues with series lookups for the Float64Index case, which indicates there may be a problem with handling indexes and integer values within the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the is_integer() and holds_integer() functions within the class to properly handle integer checks.
2. Use built-in Python functions to check for integer types instead of undefined functions.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, float) and isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code will properly handle integer and non-integer indexes and key values, addressing the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
