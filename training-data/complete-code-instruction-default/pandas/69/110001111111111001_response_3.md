Based on the error message and expected input/output variable information, it seems that the bug is caused by an incorrect check for integer type. The function is failing when dealing with float index values when it should be utilizing a different condition for non-integer indices.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition inside the loop that checks for integer indices to handle float indices separately.
2. Modify the condition to correctly identify the index type and allow appropriate indexing.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, float) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )

    return key
```

The updated code includes conditional checks for float and integer indices separately, following the correct logic according to the use case scenarios. This should address the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing tests and satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
