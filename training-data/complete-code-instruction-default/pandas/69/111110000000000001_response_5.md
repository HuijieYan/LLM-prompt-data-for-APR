1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of the `_AtIndexer` class, which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. It is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if-else condition where it checks the type of the index and the key.

3. The bug's cause is as follows:
   (a) The `_convert_key` function is not handling the type checking of keys correctly, leading to potential errors in indexing.
   (b) The `_AtIndexer` class is not performing proper type checking and validation of keys before using them for indexing.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Correctly checking the types of keys and indexes.
   - Ensuring that the type of the key matches the type of the index.
   - Adding proper error handling and validation for different types of indexes.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code:
- The type checking and validation of keys have been fixed.
- It now checks if the key is an instance of the `int` class when indexing on an integer index, and vice versa for a non-integer index.
- Proper error handling and validation have been added for different types of indexes.
