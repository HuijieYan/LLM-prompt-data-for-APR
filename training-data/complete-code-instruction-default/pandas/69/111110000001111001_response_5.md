The potential error in the buggy function is in the if statements for checking the type of indexers. These if statements are not effective in determining the type of the indexers and therefore can cause the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic used for checking the type of indexers to ensure we are correctly identifying whether the indexers are integers or not.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
This corrected function includes modified logic within the for loop to check whether the indexers are integers or not, which should address the issue and ensure that the function returns the expected results for all the provided test cases.
