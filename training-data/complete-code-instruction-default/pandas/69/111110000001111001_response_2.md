Based on the given information, the bug appears to be in the condition checks for integer and non-integer values in the 'key' when 'ax' is a numeric type. The function is not handling integer and non-integer conditions correctly for numeric 'ax' types.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checks for integer and non-integer values and handle them correctly based on the type of 'ax'. We also need to ensure that when 'is_setter' is True, the function should return a list of keys.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, str)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime-like indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, str)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta-like indexers")
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (float, np.floating)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```
This corrected function handles the conditions for different types of index 'ax' and the corresponding type of key 'i' appropriately based on the type of 'ax'. It also ensures that if 'is_setter' is True, the function returns a list of keys. This function satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided.
