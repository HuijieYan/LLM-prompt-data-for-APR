The bug arises when the function `_convert_key` is unable to handle the different types of indexes (`DatetimeIndex` and `TimedeltaIndex`). The loop inside the function compares the type of index with the type of key, causing a mismatch and raising a `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle different index types. We can check for the type of index and cast the key to the same type. This will allow the function to handle indexes of different types and avoid raising the `ValueError`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # check if the index is a datetime type
    is_datetime = isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.DatetimeIndex)

    if is_datetime:
        key = pd.to_datetime(key)
    else:
        key = pd.to_timedelta(key)

    return key
```

This corrected function will now be able to handle different index types and convert the key appropriately.

This fix is based on the assumption that the conversion of the key to the same type as the index will allow the function to operate correctly. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
