The issue is caused by the `_convert_key` function in the pandas/core/indexing.py file. This function is responsible for converting the key for indexing, and it seems to have a problem with handling non-integer keys when dealing with non-integer indexes.

The error message indicates that the specific issue is raised when trying to access a non-integer index with a non-integer key.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the _convert_key function to handle non-integer keys properly when dealing with non-integer indexes.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to update the logic in the _convert_key function to check the type of the index and handle non-integer keys accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function now checks the type of the index and appropriately handles non-integer keys when dealing with non-integer indexes. It should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
