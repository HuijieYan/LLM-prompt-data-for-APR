Potential error location: 
The potential error in the _convert_key function lies in the comparison of the index type with the key type. The function checks if the index type is an integer and then tries to match it with the key type, but there is a mistake in the logic.

Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly checking the type of the key with the type of the index and raising ValueError based on this comparison. This comparison does not properly handle cases where the index type is different from the key type.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type compatibility between the key and index elements separately for each element.
2. Use a more comprehensive type checking mechanism for the key and index types.
3. Restructure the logic of the function to properly handle different types of keys and indexes.

The corrected code:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
