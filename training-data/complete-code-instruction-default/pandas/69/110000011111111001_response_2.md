The function `_convert_key` seems to be intended to ensure that the input key has the same type as the index. It currently contains a check to verify whether the input key is an integer according to the index type. If the input key doesn't match the index type, it raises a `ValueError`.

The failing test is related to the fact that the function raises a `ValueError` when the key type doesn't match the index type. This happens because it doesn't handle the case when the input key and index types are different (e.g., when the index type is a datetime or timedelta).

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle these situations and avoid raising a `ValueError` if the input key type is different from the index type. A possible approach to fix this is to check if the input key type matches the index type or can be converted to the index type. Only raise a `ValueError` if the input key type cannot be converted to the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_list_like(i) or not all(ax.is_type_compatible(i)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have compatible non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function will not raise a `ValueError` when the input key type is different from the index type, as long as it's compatible with the index type.
