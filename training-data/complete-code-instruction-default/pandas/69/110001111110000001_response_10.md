The problem is occurring with the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The failing test is `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` file.

The error message indicates that there is a ValueError being raised in the `_convert_key` function, particularly in the part where it checks for non-integer indexes. This error is triggered by the `at` method in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexes correctly. Specifically, we need to account for the different index types when checking for integers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not ax.is_floating():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_object() or (ax.is_floating() and not ax.is_integer()):
                if not is_float(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

In this updated code, we check for `is_floating` in addition to `is_integer` and handle the conditions accordingly. This should resolve the ValueError being raised for non-integer indexes.

After making the above changes, this function should pass the failing test.
