Based on the error message and failing test, the issue seems to be related to the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class. The error message points to the location where the ValueError is being raised in the `_convert_key` function. The GitHub issue also suggests that the bug is related to `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.

The issue seems to be caused by the conversion of the key in the `_convert_key` function. It checks whether the key is an integer index or a non-integer index and raises a ValueError accordingly. However, in the failing test, it seems that the behavior of `ser.at[4]` is causing the issue as it should cast to 4.0, matching `.loc` behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the conversion of the key in a way that aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test. Specifically, it should handle the case where an integer index should cast to a non-integer index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if self.obj.axes[0].dtype.kind == 'i' and not is_integer(key):
        key = float(key)
    return key
```

This corrected function will handle the cases where an integer index should be cast to a non-integer index, which aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
