The potential error in the `_convert_key` function is the use of `is_integer(i)` without referencing it to the `ax` index. This results in a comparison between different types of objects, leading to the error. This is backed by the failing test cases, as they all involve mismatched types of keys and indexes.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to compare the type of the index with the type of the key, and raise a `ValueError` if they do not match. This will ensure that the keys are the same type as the index before proceeding. Additionally, we need to use `isinstance` to check the type of the index and key to avoid errors.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an datetime/timedelta index can only have datetime/timedelta indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an float index can only have int/float indexers")

    return key
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle different types of indexes and keys, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensuring that the failing test cases are handled correctly.
