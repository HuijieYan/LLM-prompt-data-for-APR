The bug in the `_convert_key` function is likely caused by the conditional check for the type of the index and the type of the input key. The function is supposed to convert the input key to the same type as the index, but it's failing to correctly handle non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers.

Potential Approaches to Fix the Bug:
1. Update the conditional checks to correctly handle non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers.
2. Ensure that the conversion of the input key is consistent with the type of the index and that it handles both integer and non-integer indexes appropriately.

You can replace the buggy function with the corrected code provided below:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, so we don't fallback.
    """
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    # Check if the index is integer type
    if all(ax.is_integer() for ax in self.obj.axes):
        if not all(is_integer(i) for i in key):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    else:
        if any(is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer() for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )

    return key
```

By replacing the original `_convert_key` function with the corrected version above, the function should now correctly handle cases where the index is either integer or non-integer type, and appropriately convert the input key to match the index type, thus passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
