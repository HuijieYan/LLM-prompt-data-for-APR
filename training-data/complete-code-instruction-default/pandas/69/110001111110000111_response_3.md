The problem lies within the _convert_key function in the pandas/core/indexing.py file. The current implementation of the function does not handle the case where the key is of type float in conjunction with a Float64Index.

The failing test is trying to use the get_value method with both 4.0 and 4 keys, but the _convert_key function does not handle float keys properly, resulting in a ValueError being raised.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the _convert_key function to handle float keys when working with a Float64Index. It should allow float keys for lookups since a Float64Index can contain float values.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_floating() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this fix, the _convert_key function will handle float keys properly when working with a Float64Index and the failing test should pass without any issues. This fix also addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
