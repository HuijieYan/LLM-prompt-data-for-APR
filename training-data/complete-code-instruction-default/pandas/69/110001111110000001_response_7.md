#### Analysis
The `_convert_key` function takes a key and checks if it is the same type as the index. If it's a setter, it returns a list of the key values. If not, it checks each element of the key based on certain conditions.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is related to this function, and the error indicates that there's a problem with the condition checking in the `_convert_key` function. The error message specifically mentions that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

#### Bug Cause
The `_convert_key` function appears to be incorrectly handling the condition for non-integer indexes. It is raising `ValueError` when it should not.

#### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. The condition for non-integer indexes needs to be adjusted to avoid raising an error when it is not necessary.
2. Instead of raising an error, the function should handle non-integer indexes appropriately.

#### Corrected Code
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():  # Updated the condition
                return list(key)  # Handle non-integer indexes appropriately

    return key
```
