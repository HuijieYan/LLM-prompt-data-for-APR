The potential error location within the problematic function was identified in the conditional statement for checking if it's a setter. It should be checking if it's not a setter using `if not is_setter` rather than `if is_setter`.

The bug's cause was due to the incorrect conditional statement, which resulted in incorrect validation of the indexer types. This caused issues with series lookups for the Float64Index case, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to correct the conditional statement and then iterate through the axes and keys to validate the indexer types based on the index type.

The corrected code successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub and ensures that the keys are validated based on the index type.
