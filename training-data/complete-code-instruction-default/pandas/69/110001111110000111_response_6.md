The buggy function `_convert_key` is failing due to an issue with checking for integer index and non-integer indexers. This is causing a `ValueError` to be raised when using `ser.at[4]` in the failing test function. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case when a non-integer index is used with an integer indexer, or vice versa.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle the cases where the index and indexer types do not match.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this update, the `_convert_key` function should correctly handle the cases where the index and indexer types do not match, resolving the bug. This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
