Potential Error Location: 
- The potential error location is the loop that iterates through the axes and checks if the index is an integer.

Bug's Cause:
- The buggy function is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index. However, the loop that checks the index type does not handle all possible scenarios, leading to potential errors when dealing with non-integer indexes.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the loop to handle both integer and non-integer indexes and their corresponding keys.
- Add checks to ensure that the keys and indexes are of the same type.

Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
        return key
```
In the corrected code, the loop has been modified to handle both integer and non-integer indexes and their corresponding keys. It now checks if the index is integer or non-integer and raises a ValueError if the key type does not match the index type. This ensures that the keys and indexes are of the same type, fixing the original bug.
