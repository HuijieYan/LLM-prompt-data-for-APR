The potential error in the function is in the for loop where the function checks if the index is an integer. It then checks if the indexer is an integer and the index doesn't hold integers, and vice versa. This logic seems to be flawed and is likely causing the function to fail for certain cases.

The bug appears to be causing issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case. The function is not handling indexing correctly for certain types of indexes.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `_convert_key` function to properly handle different types of indexes and indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.index, key):
        if is_integer(i) and not ax.is_type_compatible(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an index can only have indexers of the same type"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code ensures that the indexer `i` matches the type of the index `ax`, and raises a ValueError if they are not compatible. This approach aligns with the expected input/output variable information and should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
