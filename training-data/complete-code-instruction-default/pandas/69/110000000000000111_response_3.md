1. The problematic function _convert_key is used in Series lookups and is causing issues for Float64Index case, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function is intended to convert keys to the same type as the index. However, there are potential errors in the logic that are causing the bug.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop where it checks the type of the index and key.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a) The problematic function is not correctly handling cases where the index is non-integer and the key is an integer, or vice versa.
   (b) This is causing issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Add additional checks to correctly handle cases where the index and key types do not match.
   (b) Improve the error handling and raise specific exceptions to indicate the type mismatch.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )

    return key
```

The corrected function now includes additional checks to handle cases where the index and key types do not match, as well as improved error handling. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
