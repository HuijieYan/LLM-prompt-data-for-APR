Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the function lies in the if-else condition where it checks for integer index and non-integer index.

Bug's Cause:
The bug causes incorrect validation for integer and non-integer indexers, leading to errors in series lookups for Float64Index.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the validation conditions for integer and non-integer indexers to correctly handle the Float64Index case.
2. Add specific checks for Float64Index to ensure that the correct type of indexers is used.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if type(i) != float:
                raise ValueError(
                    "Float64Index based indexing can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
The corrected code includes specific checks for the Float64Index case to ensure that only float indexers are used. Additionally, it retains the original integer and non-integer index validation for other types of indexes. This should successfully resolve the issue with series lookups for Float64Index.
