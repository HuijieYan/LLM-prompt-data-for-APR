The buggy function `_convert_key` is related to the class `_AtIndexer`, which is a part of the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The function is used for converting a key and checks if the key is valid for indexing. The function iterates over a set of axes of the input object and verifies if each value of the key matches the type expected by the axis. The error message indicates that for an integer axis, only integer values are allowed in the key, and similarly for a non-integer axis, only non-integer values should be in the key.

The potential error location is in the loop that iterates over the axes and key, where it checks for the type of values.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the conversion and validation of the key for indexing, leading to the wrong error being raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic for checking the type of values in the key for each axis to correctly check against the integer and non-integer types.
2. Use the dtype information from the index to perform the type-checking of the key values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, `_convert_key`:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                    raise TypeError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise TypeError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
The corrected code includes using `pd.api.types.is_integer` to check the type of the value `i` with respect to the axis `ax`. Additionally, the error is raised as `TypeError` instead of `ValueError`.
