The buggy function `_convert_key` has a bug that is causing the failing test in the test file `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py`. The error message indicates that when using `ser.at[4]` and `ser.at[4.0]`, a `ValueError` is being raised regarding the integer and non-integer indexers.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect implementation in the `_convert_key` function when checking for integer and non-integer indexers. This is causing the `ValueError` to be raised when it shouldn't.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the implementation of the `_convert_key` function to properly handle integer and non-integer indexers. This will ensure that the function returns the correct key without raising any `ValueError`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the failing test passes. It also addresses the issue posted in the GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value".
