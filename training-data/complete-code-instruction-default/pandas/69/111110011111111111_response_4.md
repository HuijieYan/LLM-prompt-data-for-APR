The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers. This is causing a ValueError to be raised when it shouldn't.

The bug's cause is that the _convert_key function is incorrectly raising a ValueError for non-integer indexers when it shouldn't for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, a possible approach is to modify the _convert_key function to check for the correct conditions for non-integer indexers based on the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, np.datetime64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime-like indexers"
                )
            elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, np.timedelta64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta-like indexers"
                )
            elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have integer indexers"
                )

        return key
```

This correction ensures that the _convert_key function correctly checks for the type of index and indexer and raises a ValueError only when necessary. It should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
