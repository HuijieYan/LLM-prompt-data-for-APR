The issue with the `_convert_key` function is that it does not handle integer and non-integer indexers correctly. It is not checking the type of index and validating the type of indexers against it.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison logic and type checking for integer and non-integer indexers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly check the type of the index and validate the type of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, str)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime or string indexers"
            )
        if isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
            )
        if isinstance(ax, pd.NumericIndex) and not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.number):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This modified function correctly checks the type of the index and validates the type of indexers against it, ensuring that the indexers match the index type. The fixes made in the corrected function should address the issues observed in the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output variable information.
