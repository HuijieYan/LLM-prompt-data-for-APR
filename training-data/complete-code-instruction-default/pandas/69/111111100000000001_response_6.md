4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Check if the key is a Pandas Index and then convert it to a list if it is not already one.
   (b). Use the `all()` function to simplify the logic for checking integer and non-integer keys.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        # convert key to list if it's not already a list
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = [key]
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, the `_convert_key` function has been updated to first check if the key is a list, and if not, convert it to a list. Then, it iterates through the axes and the key elements to check if the indexing is consistent with the type of the index. The use of `is_integer()` simplifies the logic for checking integer and non-integer keys.
