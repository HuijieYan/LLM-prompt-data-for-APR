# Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, test code, error message, and GitHub issue:

The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `_AtIndexer` class and is responsible for converting keys based on certain conditions. The failing test code is trying to use `ser.at[4]` and is encountering a `ValueError` because of the conditions set in the `_convert_key` function. The GitHub issue suggests that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

The error message indicates that the issue is related to "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" which is being raised from within the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class.

# Identifying the potential error location within the problematic function:

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is likely in the else block of the loop where it is checking for non-integer indices. There seems to be an issue with the condition or the logic causing the ValueError to be raised.

# Elucidating the bug's cause:

The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indices correctly, leading to the ValueError being raised when performing certain lookups.

# Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Review the logic of the conditions in the `_convert_key` function to ensure that non-integer indices are handled correctly.
2. Update the conditions to properly check for non-integer indexers and handle them appropriately.

# The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_datetime() and not is_datetime(i):  # Adding condition to check for datetime index
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index "
                    "can only have datetime indexers"
                )
            elif ax.is_timedelta() and not is_timedelta(i):  # Adding condition to check for timedelta index
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index "
                    "can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we have added conditions to properly check for datetime and timedelta indices and handle them appropriately in the `_convert_key` function.

By implementing these changes, the fixed function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
