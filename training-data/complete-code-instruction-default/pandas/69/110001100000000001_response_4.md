1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the keys to be the same type as the index. It checks the type of the index and the type of the keys and raises a ValueError if they do not match.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is most likely within the loop that iterates over the axes and checks the type of the index and the keys.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect type comparison within the loop that checks the index and the keys. The function `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` are not defined within the given code snippet, so it's unclear where those functions are coming from. It's possible that there could be a mix-up in the usage of these functions which is causing the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Ensuring that the correct functions for checking integer types are used within the loop.
   b. Checking the type of the index and the keys using the appropriate functions.
   c. Handling the different types of indexes and keys appropriately based on their types.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we use `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` functions replaced with `pd.api.types.is_integer()` and `pd.api.types.is_integer()` to correctly check the type of the index and keys. Also, we added a check for Int64Index and Float64Index types to handle integer and non-integer indexes appropriately.
