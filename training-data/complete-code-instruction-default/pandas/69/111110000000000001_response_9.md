1. The buggy function "_convert_key" is a method of the class "_AtIndexer". It is used to convert the keys to the same type as the index. The function validates the keys and checks if they are of the same type as the index. If it is a setter, it allows arbitrary setting.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the validation and type checking of the keys.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the validation and type checking of the keys properly, leading to potential errors in the indexing process. The class "_AtIndexer" seems to be a part of a larger code base that involves indexing and accessing elements in a data structure, and this function is essential for ensuring compatibility and type safety when indexing.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding proper validation and type checking for the keys based on the index type.
   - Handling the case when it is a setter and allowing arbitrary setting of keys.
   - Ensuring that the function returns the correct type of keys for indexing.

5. The corrected code:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index " 
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer " 
                        "index can only have non-integer " 
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
In the corrected code, we have added proper type checking using the `isinstance()` function and raised appropriate ValueErrors when the type of the key does not match the index. We have also added a check for arbitrary setting when it is a setter, and ensured that the function returns the correct type of keys for indexing.
