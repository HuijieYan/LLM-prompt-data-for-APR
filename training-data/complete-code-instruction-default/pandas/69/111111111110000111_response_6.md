The bug is in the `_convert_key` function inside the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is responsible for converting the key to be the same type as the index, but it is not handling non-integer indexes properly. This is causing a ValueError when using the `ser.at[4]` in the failing test.

The error message indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexes properly and is raising a ValueError for non-integer indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes. We need to check if the index is non-integer and only accept non-integer indexers. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should handle both integer and non-integer indexes properly and pass the failing test.

With this fix, the GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" should be resolved as the bug in the `_convert_key` function has been fixed.
