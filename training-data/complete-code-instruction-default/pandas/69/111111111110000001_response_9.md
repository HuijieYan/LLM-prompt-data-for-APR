The `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class is designed to require keys to be the same type as the index. However, the current implementation modifies the keys to a list if `is_setter` is True and then checks if the keys are of the same type as the index. This is contradictory. Additionally, in the test, when trying to access a specific index using 'at' indexer, the error shows that it fails with a "ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers.", indicating a discrepancy between the expected and actual behavior of the function.

The potential error is located in the conditional statement where it checks if `is_setter` is True, and the subsequent return list(key) statement. This change to a list contradicts the requirement to have keys of the same type as the index.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle keys properly based on their type, rather return a list when `is_setter` is True.

The corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if not is_setter:
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

The above corrected code should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
