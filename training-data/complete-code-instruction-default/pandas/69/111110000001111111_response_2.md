The issue is caused by the incorrect checking of whether the index and the key have the same type in the `_convert_key` function. The function incorrectly compares the type of the key with the type of the index, which leads to incorrect type checking and therefore wrong behavior.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly compare the type of each element in the key with the type of the corresponding index. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the index is a `datetime64` or `timedelta64` type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, np.datetime64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "DatetimeIndex based indexing can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, np.timedelta64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "TimedeltaIndex based indexing can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            if type(i) != type(ax[0]):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Index type mismatch. Key must have the same type as the index."
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes checks for `DatetimeIndex`, `TimedeltaIndex`, and other index types to ensure that the key has the correct type for the corresponding index. It also handles the case when the index is a `datetime64` or `timedelta64` type.

With this corrected function, the issue described in the GitHub bug report should be resolved, and the function should now correctly handle the specified test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
