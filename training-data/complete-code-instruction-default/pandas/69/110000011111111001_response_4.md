The bug in the `_convert_key` function is that it incorrectly checks if the index or key is an integer or not. The bug causes the function to raise a ValueError when it shouldn't.

The failure in the test occurs because the function is incorrectly classifying the index as non-integer while it should be classified as an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly check if the index and key are integers:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        if not isinstance(i, int) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this modification, the function should correctly identify whether the index is an integer index or a non-integer index and appropriately raise an error if the key doesn't match.

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected input/output variable information.
