The problematic function is `_convert_key` in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This function handles type conversion for keys used in indexing objects.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` file demonstrates the issue. The error message indicates that "At based indexing on non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

The issue seems to be with the condition for checking if `i` is an integer. Currently, the function checks `if is_integer(i)` which is incorrect.

One approach to fixing the bug is to change the condition for checking if `i` is an integer by using `isinstance(i, int)` or any suitable method to check if `i` is an integer.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):  # Check if i is an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():  # Check if i is an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected function should now pass the failing test for the bug.
