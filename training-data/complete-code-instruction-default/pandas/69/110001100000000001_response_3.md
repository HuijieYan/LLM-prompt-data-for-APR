Potential error location: The potential error is in the if else statement where the function should check if the key is an integer index or a non-integer index.

Bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function checks if the key is an integer or non-integer index, but there are issues with the implementation of these checks.
(b) The related functions, such as ax.is_integer() and ax.holds_integer(), are used to determine the type of index, but the comparison logic is flawed.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Fix the comparison logic for determining if the key is an integer or non-integer index. Use appropriate methods to check the type of index and the type of indexers being used.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() or ax.holds_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) or ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, the comparison logic is fixed to properly determine if the key is an integer or non-integer index. The appropriate methods are used to check the type of index and the type of indexers being used.
