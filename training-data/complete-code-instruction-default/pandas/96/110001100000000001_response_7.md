The potential error in the buggy function is on the line: `if isinstance(other, datetime):`. The error is caused by the fact that `datetime` class is not imported in this function.

To fix the bug:
1. The `datetime` class should be imported at the beginning of the file. 
2. Change `datetime` to `pd.Timestamp` to fix the bug.
3. The comparison `other.time() in self.end` should be `other.time() in self.end.time` to check if `other.time()` is within the time range.

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd

# Other functions from the same file, but not the same class, are called by the buggy function

# ... (other functions)

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):

    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):  # Change datetime to pd.Timestamp
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = pd.Timestamp(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end.time or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start.time:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # rest of the function body unchanged
        # ...
    
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
