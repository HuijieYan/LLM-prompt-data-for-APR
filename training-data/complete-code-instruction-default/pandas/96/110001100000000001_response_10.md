The buggy function is a method that is intended to apply business hours in a datetime calculation. The potential error location is the logic used to adjust the datetime based on the business hours.

The bug's cause is related to how the function handles the adjustment of the datetime by business days and remaining business hours. It seems that the logic for adjusting the business hours is incorrect, which is causing the datetime calculation to produce incorrect results.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to carefully review the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and business days, ensuring that the calculations are accurate.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BuggyClass:
    # ... (other methods)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            if n >= 0:
                other = self.adjust_for_positive_n(other, businesshours)
            else:
                other = self.adjust_for_negative_n(other, businesshours)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def adjust_for_positive_n(self, other, businesshours):
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = self.adjust_for_business_days(bd, other)

        other = self.adjust_for_remaining_hours(other, r)

        return other

    def adjust_for_negative_n(self, other, businesshours):
        if other.time() in self.start:
            # adjustment to move to previous business day
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = self.adjust_for_business_days(bd, other)

        other = self.adjust_for_remaining_hours(other, r)

        return other

    def adjust_for_business_days(self, bd, other):
        # adjust by business days first
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other = other + skip_bd

        return other

    def adjust_for_remaining_hours(self, other, r):
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
```
In the corrected code, the logic for adjusting the datetime by business days and remaining business hours has been refactored and streamlined to ensure accurate calculations. This should address the bug in the original function.
