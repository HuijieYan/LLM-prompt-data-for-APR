Analysis:
The buggy function is a part of the pandas library that is used in conjunction with the CustomBusinessHour offset to calculate custom business hours. The GitHub issue revolves around the behavior of the date_range function when using periods and adding holidays. The buggy function seems to be modifying the input datetime based on business hours, and this modification may be causing unexpected behavior when using periods and holidays in date_range.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error can be in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours, as this adjustment seems to be causing the unexpected behavior observed in the GitHub issue.

Bug's Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the faulty adjustment of the datetime based on business hours, which affects the behavior of the date_range function when using periods and holidays.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of datetimes based on business hours does not interfere with the behavior of date_range when using periods and holidays.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting the datetime and ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior of date_range.

The corrected code is provided below:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BDay

# corrected function to fix the bug
def apply(self, other, holidays=None):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if holidays is None:
            adjusted_other = other
        else:
            cbh = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, holidays=holidays)
            adjusted_other = cbh.apply(other)

        return adjusted_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the apply function has been redefined to take the holidays as an input parameter. The CustomBusinessHour is applied to the input datetime to obtain the adjusted_other. This approach should help resolve the issue of unexpected behavior in the date_range function when using periods and holidays.
