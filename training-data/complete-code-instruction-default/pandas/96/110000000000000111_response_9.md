1. The buggy function 'apply' is related to the GitHub issue as it is part of the code that is causing unexpected behavior in the date_range function when using periods and adding holidays. The 'apply' function is used to adjust datetime objects based on business hours and is closely related to the behavior of the CustomBusinessHour offset in pandas.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the function is adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours and holidays. This is where the unexpected behavior is being caused, resulting in more periods than expected when holidays are added.

3. The cause of the bug can be inferred from the GitHub issue and the buggy function. It seems that the adjustments made in the 'apply' function are not properly handling holidays, resulting in additional periods being generated when holidays are included in the calculation. This points to a potential issue with how holidays are being accounted for when adjusting the datetime object based on business hours.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Properly accounting for holidays in the adjustments made within the 'apply' function.
   - Ensuring that the calculation of periods and adjustments does not produce unexpected results when holidays are added.
   - Reviewing the logic for handling holidays and adjusting the datetime object based on business hours to identify any potential errors.

5. Here is the corrected code for the 'apply' function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay
from pandas.tseries.offsets import Day
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BDay

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # original code - unchanged
        if other.time() in self.start:
            # adjustment to move to previous business day
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day - unchanged
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # logic to adjust for holidays and business hours - modified
        holiday_hours = 0
        for holiday in self.holidays:
            if holiday.date() == other.date():
                holiday_hours += 1

        total_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[-1])
        total_business_days = (other - datetime.combine(other.date(), time(0, 0))).days
        total_business_hours = total_business_days * total_hours + businesshours + (holiday_hours * 60 * 60)

        new_time = (other - datetime.datetime.combine(other.date(), time(0, 0))).seconds / 3600

        period, remainder = divmod(abs(self.n) * 60, total_hours // 60)
        if self.n < 0:
            period, remainder = -period, -remainder

        if self.n >= 0:
            new_time += period * total_hours / 3600
        else:
            new_time -= period * total_hours / 3600

        # calculate new datetime after adjustments
        new_datetime = datetime.combine(other.date(), time(0, 0)) + timedelta(hours=new_time)

        return new_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, adjustments are made to properly account for holidays and business hours, ensuring that the calculation of periods and adjustments does not produce unexpected results when holidays are added. This should resolve the issue reported on the GitHub page.
