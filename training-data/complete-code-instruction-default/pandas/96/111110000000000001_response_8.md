The potential error location in the `apply` function is the `if bd != 0` block, specifically the line `if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):`. It seems that the intention is to call the `is_on_offset` method of the `next_bday`, but it's missing parentheses, so it's actually attempting to access the `is_on_offset` attribute directly. This could be a typo or a misunderstanding of how to call methods.

The bug is causing the application to fail because it's trying to access the `is_on_offset` attribute of `self.next_bday` directly, instead of calling the method with `self.next_bday()`. This leads to a "AttributeError" at runtime.

To fix this bug, the `is_on_offset` method should be called on `self.next_bday` by adding parentheses after it. Additionally, a reference to `self` should be used to call the `is_on_offset` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # (previous code remains unchanged)

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        # (remaining code remains unchanged)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
