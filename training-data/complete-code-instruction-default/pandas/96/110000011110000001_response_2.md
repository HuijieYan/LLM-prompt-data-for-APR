The problem is caused by the `apply` function, which is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours. The error occurs when the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is used in the test and the code fails to properly handle this custom frequency, which results in a ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and adjust the datetime accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # handle the CustomBusinessHour frequency
        if hasattr(self, "start") and hasattr(self, "end"):
            start = getattr(self, "start")
            end = getattr(self, "end")
            if hasattr(start, "hour") and hasattr(end, "hour"):
                start_str = start.strftime("%H:%M")
                end_str = end.strftime("%H:%M")
                business_hour = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start=start_str, end=end_str, holidays=self.holidays)
                return other + (business_hour * n)

        # rest of the code remains the same...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected `apply` function now checks if the `start` and `end` attributes are present, and if so, constructs a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency based on those values and the specified `holidays`. Then, it adjusts the `other` datetime based on this custom frequency and returns the adjusted datetime.

This should fix the issue with the failing test and the error message.
