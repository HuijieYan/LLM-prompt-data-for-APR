The error occurs when the `apply` function is being used to adjust business hours in the `CustomBusinessHour` offset from the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` unit test. The error message indicates a problem with frequency validation for a `DatetimeArray`.

The potential error location within the `apply` function is the adjustment of `other` to the next opening time and closing time. It seems that this adjustment does not handle the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency properly, leading to an incorrect result.

The bug's cause lies in the `apply` function's incorrect adjustment process for the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, leading to an error in the frequency validation during the test execution.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the adjustments made within the `apply` function are compatible with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. This involves correctly handling the `CustomBusinessHour` schedule when adjusting the `other` datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
