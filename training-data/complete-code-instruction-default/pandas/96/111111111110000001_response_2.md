The buggy function is `apply` from the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function is designed to calculate the next date based on business hours, but it seems to have some issues when handling the edge cases.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` is intended to use the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` class to set custom business hours with a start time of "15:00" and a holiday on "2020-11-26". However, the test fails with a `ValueError`.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with frequency validation, and it seems to be related to the `apply` function. The `apply` function makes calculations related to business hours and the error implies that the frequency generated does not conform to the expected frequency.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for handling the business hours calculation and ensure that it is correctly updating the dates and times based on the defined business hours and custom holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                # Logic to handle positive n
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                # Logic to handle negative n
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                while n < 0:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting the date and time based on business hours and the given offset `n` has been modified to address the edge cases and handle both positive and negative offsets accurately.

This corrected version should address the issues related to frequency validation and ensure that the `apply` function behaves as expected when calculating dates based on business hours.
