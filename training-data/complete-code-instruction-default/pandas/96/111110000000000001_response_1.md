The potential error in the problematic function is the logic for adjusting the time based on business hours. The function is not properly handling the case when `n` (the number of business hours to adjust) is negative. This results in incorrect adjustments when `n` is negative, and potentially wrong calculations when `n` is positive.

To fix the bug, we can rewrite the logic for adjusting the time based on business hours to properly handle both positive and negative values of `n`. The logic should also be simplified to make the code more maintainable.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # this is the fixed function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # (all code inside the function remains unchanged)
            # ...

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            total_minutes = abs(n * 60)
            effective_minutes = total_minutes % (businesshours // 60)

            # handle negative number of business hours
            if n < 0 and effective_minutes > 0:
                effective_minutes = businesshours - effective_minutes

            # business day adjustment logic
            business_days = n // (businesshours // 60)
            other += timedelta(days=business_days)

            # handle positive number of business hours
            if n > 0 and effective_minutes > 0:
                curr_time = other.time()
                for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end):
                    if start <= curr_time < end:
                        minutes_left = (end.hour - curr_time.hour) * 60 + (end.minute - curr_time.minute)
                        if minutes_left >= effective_minutes:
                            other = datetime.combine(other.date(), curr_time + timedelta(minutes=effective_minutes))
                            effective_minutes = 0
                        else:
                            effective_minutes -= minutes_left
                            other = datetime.combine(other.date(), end)
                            curr_time = end

            # handle negative number of business hours
            if n < 0 and effective_minutes > 0:
                curr_time = other.time()
                for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end):
                    if start < curr_time <= end:
                        minutes_left = (curr_time.hour - start.hour) * 60 + (curr_time.minute - start.minute)
                        if minutes_left >= effective_minutes:
                            other = datetime.combine(other.date(), curr_time - timedelta(minutes=effective_minutes))
                            effective_minutes = 0
                        else:
                            effective_minutes -= minutes_left
                            other = datetime.combine(other.date(), start)
                            curr_time = start

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
