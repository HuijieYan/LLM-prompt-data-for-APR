The problem lies in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The method attempts to adjust the given datetime according to the business hour and holiday schedule, but it fails to do so correctly, leading to unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function.

The cause of the bug is the improper handling of holidays in the `apply` method. When holidays are provided, the method fails to adjust the datetime properly, leading to an increased number of periods being generated by `pd.date_range` than expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for holidays in the `apply` method and properly adjust the datetime based on the business hour and holiday schedule.
2. Ensure that the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days, business hours, and holidays is correctly implemented.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

class BusinessHourMixin:

    # ... (other methods remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            if n >= 0:
                while r > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if r < bhour.seconds / 60:  # convert seconds to minutes
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= bhour.seconds / 60
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while r > 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if r > bhour.seconds / 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= bhour.seconds / 60
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected code, the `pd.date_range` function should work correctly when using periods and adding holidays, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
