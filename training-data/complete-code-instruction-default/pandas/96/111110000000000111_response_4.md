The provided buggy function is a method called "apply" within the class "BusinessHourMixin". This class seems to be related to managing business hours and has methods for checking business hour related operations.

The GitHub issue is related to using "pd.date_range" with "pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour" and adding holidays, which results in unexpected behavior by producing more than the specified number of periods.

The potential error in the buggy function seems to lie in the logic for adjusting the datetime by business hours, which might be causing the unexpected behavior when combined with holidays.

The cause of the bug could be related to the incorrect calculation or adjustment of business times when combined with holidays, leading to an increased number of periods in the output of "pd.date_range".

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the logic for adjusting the datetime by business hours to ensure it works correctly in combination with holidays. Additionally, checking the calculations related to business days and remaining business hours might help in identifying and fixing the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function with fixes:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        # Adjust for holidays
        if self.is_on_offset(other):
            while n >= 0 and other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while n < 0 and other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # rest of the function remains unchanged
        # ...

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code includes additional logic to properly handle holidays and adjust the datetime by business hours accordingly. This should help in resolving the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
