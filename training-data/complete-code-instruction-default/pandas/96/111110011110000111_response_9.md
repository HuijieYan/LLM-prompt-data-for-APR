1. The buggy function `apply` belongs to the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` triggers an error related to the `pd.date_range` function when using custom business hours with holidays. The error message indicates a problem with the validation of the frequency and the behavior of the date range when adding holidays.

2. The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic for adjusting the business hours based on the input parameters.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This causes the `pd.date_range` function to produce unexpected results when used with custom business hours and holidays. The GitHub issue confirms this behavior, as the user experiences unexpected output when using custom business hours with holidays in the `pd.date_range` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for adjusting business days and business hours in the `apply` function.
   - Ensure that the adjustment logic handles holidays correctly.
   - Verify the calculation of business days and remaining business hours to align with the expected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... Other functions from the class ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)

            if self.start <= other.time() < self.end:
                return other  # Return input datetime if it's within business hours

            if self.n == 0:  # If no business hour offset, return the input datetime
                return other

            direction = 1 if self.n > 0 else -1
            abs_n = abs(self.n)
            remaining_abs_n = abs_n

            new_dt = other
            holidays = self.get_holidays()

            while remaining_abs_n > 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(new_dt, sign=direction)
                next_closing = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)

                if direction == 1:
                    business_hours_left = (next_closing - new_dt).total_seconds() / 3600
                else:
                    business_hours_left = (new_dt - next_opening).total_seconds() / 3600

                if business_hours_left >= remaining_abs_n:  # Enough business hours left for the offset
                    return next_closing if direction == 1 else next_opening

                remaining_abs_n -= business_hours_left

                if direction == 1:  # Move to the next business day
                    days_to_add = (remaining_abs_n // self.business_hours_per_day) + 1
                    new_dt += timedelta(days=days_to_add)
                    while new_dt.weekday() in holidays:
                        new_dt += timedelta(days=1)
                else:  # Move to the previous business day
                    days_to_subtract = (remaining_abs_n // self.business_hours_per_day) + 1
                    new_dt -= timedelta(days=days_to_subtract)
                    while new_dt.weekday() in holidays:
                        new_dt -= timedelta(days=1)

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In this corrected code, the adjustment logic for business days and business hours has been revised to ensure correct behavior when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
