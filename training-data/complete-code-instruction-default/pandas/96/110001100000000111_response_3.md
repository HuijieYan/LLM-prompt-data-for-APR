Potential error location: The issue is likely in the `apply` function where the calculation of business days and business hours is not working correctly, causing the `pd.date_range` to produce unexpected results when holidays are added.

Bug cause: The bug seems to be caused by incorrect calculation of business days and business hours in the `apply` function, leading the `pd.date_range` to produce unexpected results when holidays are added. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the behavior is inconsistent when periods are used instead of end.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the business days and business hours calculation in the `apply` function to ensure they are working as expected.
2. Review the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and business hours to handle holidays properly.

Corrected code:
```python
# Corrected apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=n)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n != 0:
            other = other + (n * business_day_offset)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code should handle the calculation of business days and business hours correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub related to the unexpected behavior of `pd.date_range` when holidays are added.
