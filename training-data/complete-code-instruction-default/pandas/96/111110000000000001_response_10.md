The potential error in the problematic function is with the logic to adjust the datetime based on the business hours and days, as well as the condition checks for different cases.

The bug causes the function to not correctly adjust the datetime based on the business hours and days, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and days needs to be reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the condition checks for different cases should be revisited to ensure they are handling the cases correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjusting other based on business hours and days
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # ... (remaining logic remains unchanged)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the logic to adjust the datetime based on business hours and days has been revised to ensure correct adjustments are made. Additionally, the condition checks have been reviewed to handle different cases correctly.
