The function `apply` takes two datetime objects `self` and `other`, and performs various operations based on the values of these objects. It uses several other functions defined in the same file `offsets.py` to perform these operations.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to this buggy function as it uses the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, which is affected by the `apply` function's incorrect operations.

The error message indicates that there is a ValueError raised during the validation of the frequency of dates, and it mentions that the "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH".

This implies that there is an issue with inferring the frequency from the passed values, which is likely due to incorrect calculations or manipulations of the `other` datetime object within the `apply` function.

The buggy function's operations on the `other` datetime object could be causing the incorrect frequency inference, resulting in a ValueError during frequency validation.

To fix the bug:
1. Identify and correct the operations in the function that manipulate the `other` datetime object.
2. Verify that the correct frequency is being inferred from the passed values.
3. Test the function with the failing test case to ensure that the issue has been resolved.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function after fixing the identified issues:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        business_hour_start = self.start[0].replace(year=other.year, month=other.month, day=other.day)
        business_hour_end = self.end[-1].replace(year=other.year, month=other.month, day=other.day)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > self.end[-1].time() or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(business_hour_end)
                other = next_opening
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0].time():
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)

        if n < 0:
            diff = business_hour_start - business_hour_end
        else:
            diff = business_hour_end - business_hour_start

        remaining_business_hours = diff.total_seconds() / 60
        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n * 60), remaining_business_hours)

        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours

        adjusted_datetime = business_hour_start
        adjusted_datetime += timedelta(days=business_days)

        remaining_time = timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)

        while remaining_time.total_seconds() > 0:
            next_opening = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
            time_interval = next_opening - adjusted_datetime
            if remaining_time < time_interval:
                adjusted_datetime += remaining_time
                remaining_time = timedelta(0)
            else:
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime + time_interval)
                remaining_time -= time_interval

        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
