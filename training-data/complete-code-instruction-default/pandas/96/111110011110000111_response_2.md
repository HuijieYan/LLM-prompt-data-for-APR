The provided buggy function is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a mixin class that extends the `BusinessMixin` class. The function `apply` is the buggy function. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is pointing to an issue related to `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays.

The error is occurring at the `pd.DatetimeIndex` creation in the failing test due to the unexpected behavior of `pd.date_range` while using `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays, which is causing the mismatch in the frequencies and resulting in a `ValueError`.

The root cause of the issue is in the `apply` function, particularly in the way the adjustments for business days and business hours are being calculated and applied to the input datetime. The incorrect adjustments and calculations for business days and business hours are causing the unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the calculations for business days and business hours to ensure that the adjustments are correctly applied to the input datetime. The adjustments should account for holidays and the specified business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    # The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
    class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

        # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

        # this is the corrected function
        @apply_wraps
        def apply(self, other):
            if isinstance(other, datetime):
                # reset timezone and nanosecond
                other = other.replace(
                    hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0
                )
                n = self.n

                # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
                if n >= 0:
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        # adjustment to move to previous business day
                        other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                business_hours = sum(
                    self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                    for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
                )

                bhours_per_day = business_hours / 3600.0

                if n > 0:
                    delta_days = n // bhours_per_day
                    remaining_hours = n % bhours_per_day
                else:
                    delta_days = -((-n) // bhours_per_day)
                    remaining_hours = -((-n) % bhours_per_day)

                other += timedelta(days=delta_days)

                # Find the starting hour
                current_hour = other.hour
                for start_hour in self.start:
                    if current_hour < start_hour:
                        other = other.replace(
                            hour=start_hour, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0
                        )
                        break

                remaining_seconds = remaining_hours * 3600
                while remaining_seconds > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if remaining_seconds < bhour.total_seconds():
                        other += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                        break
                    remaining_seconds -= bhour.seconds
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                return other
            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function calculates the adjustments for business days and business hours more accurately and handles the input datetime based on the specified business hours and holidays. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
