The problematic function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is called by the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The error message indicates a ValueError is being raised in the `_validate_frequency` method, which is likely caused by the incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function.

The bug is likely causing the `apply` function to incorrectly calculate the date_range when holidays are provided, leading to more periods than expected and resulting in a ValueError.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to properly handle holidays when calculating the date_range. It should adjust the date_range to exclude the holiday dates.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply` function that addresses the issue:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

        # ... (other code remains unchanged)

        if isinstance(self, pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour):
            # Exclude holidays from date_range
            all_hours = pd.date_range(start=other, end=other + timedelta(365), freq=self)
            business_hours = [x for x in all_hours if self._is_on_offset(x)]
            idx = business_hours.index(other)
            business_hours = business_hours[idx:]

            return business_hours

        # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the above change, the `apply` function should now correctly handle holidays in the date_range calculation, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
