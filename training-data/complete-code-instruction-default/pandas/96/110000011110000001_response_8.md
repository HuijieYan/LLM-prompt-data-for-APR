The potential issue in the buggy function is related to the validation of frequency when using custom business hours. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency CBH.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the custom business hour frequency correctly, leading to a validation error when trying to generate the range based on the inferred and passed frequencies.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the custom business hour frequency and ensure that the inferred frequency aligns with the passed frequency.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
