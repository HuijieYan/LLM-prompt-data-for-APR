The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic related to adjusting business hours and the calculation of the remaining business hours. It seems that the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours may not be correctly handling all cases.

The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect handling of the business day adjustments, as well as issues with the calculations of remaining business hours.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours and ensure that it covers all edge cases and scenarios.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n
        business_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    )
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected code, I removed unnecessary functions and refactored the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours. I also modified some variable names to make the code more readable.
