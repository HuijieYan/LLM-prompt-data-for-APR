The problem is likely caused by the 'apply' function within the 'BusinessHourMixin' class. This function is taking a datetime object and trying to apply business hours to it, but the logic within the function has some issues, leading to the ValueError in the failing test.

The issue with the 'apply' function is that it is not adjusting the 'other' datetime object correctly based on the business hours. There seems to be some incorrect logic applied to adjust the datetime object based on the business days and remaining business hours.

To fix this issue, the 'apply' function should be adjusted to correctly calculate the new datetime after applying the business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the 'apply' function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 60
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 60

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function adjusts the 'other' datetime object based on 'n' (number of minutes) by moving it forward or backward within the business hours.

This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
