The potential error location within the problematic function is in the following line:

```python
if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
```

Since `next_bday` is a method of the current class `BusinessHourMixin`, it should be called on the instance `self.next_bday()` rather than `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)`.

The cause of the bug is that the `next_bday` method is being incorrectly called without the parentheses, causing a syntax error and preventing the function from running properly.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to call the `next_bday` method with the parentheses to ensure it runs correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The corrected code of the buggy function

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other methods)
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... (other code)

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):  # corrected method call
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # ... (other code)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The correction made to the buggy function involves calling the `next_bday` method with parentheses to ensure it operates as a method of the current class instance.
