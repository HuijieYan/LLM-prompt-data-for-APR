The problematic function `apply` is meant to adjust a datetime object based on certain conditions. The function is trying to identify if the input `other` is an instance of `datetime`, and if so, perform adjustments on it. However, there are several issues with the implementation which are leading to the failure of the test.

The direct cause of the failure is not immediately clear without more context on what the exact requirements of the `apply` function are. However, it seems that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object are not working as expected and are not conforming to the frequency requirements, as indicated by the error message.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object align with the frequency requirements.
2. We also need to handle different cases based on the input and the value of `n`.

The corrected code for the problematic function `apply`:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

# fix the function to handle different cases based on the input and the value of n
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = other.nanosecond
        n = self.n

        # adjust other based on the value of n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd) + remain
            else:
                other += pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # make adjustments based on the value of n
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ValueError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
