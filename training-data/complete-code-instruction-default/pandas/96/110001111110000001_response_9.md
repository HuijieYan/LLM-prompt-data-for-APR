The bug is caused by the usage of the `datetime` object without importing it. This causes an error when using `datetime` without defining it explicitly. The error occurs at the line `if isinstance(other, datetime):` because `datetime` is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `datetime` module at the beginning of the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` using the following import statement:

```python
from datetime import datetime
```

This will ensure that the `datetime` object is properly defined and can be used within the `apply` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime  # import datetime module

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # rest of the function...
```

With the above fix, the `apply` function should work correctly and pass the failing test.
