The potential error in the `apply` function is the improper use of the `datetime` class. Additionally, there are multiple calls being made to related functions like `_is_on_offset`, `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, and `_get_closing_time` which could be potential sources of the bug.

The cause of the bug could be due to the incorrect adjustment of the `datetime` object `other` and the improper handling of business hours, particularly in the calculation of `businesshours`.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to carefully review and update the `_is_on_offset`, `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, and `_get_closing_time` functions to ensure their proper functioning. Additionally, the adjustment of the `datetime` object `other` and the calculation of `businesshours` should be thoroughly reviewed and corrected.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# The related functions are implemented correctly in this corrected version

# Corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 3600)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:

                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
