Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function is likely related to the calculation and adjustment of business hours and days. There seems to be an issue with handling holidays and adjusting the business hours accordingly, which is causing unexpected behavior in the test case.

Bug's Cause:
The failing test shows that when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and adding holidays, the output includes more periods than expected. This occurs because the buggy function does not handle holidays and business hour adjustments correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Identify the logic responsible for adjusting business hours and days based on the input parameters.
2. Check for any inconsistencies in the code related to holiday handling and business hour adjustments.
3. Update the logic to properly account for holidays and adjust the business hours accordingly.

Corrected Code for the Buggy Function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # handle holidays
        if other in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyHolidayError("The date is a holiday")
        
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected code:
- Added logic to handle holidays and raise an error if the date is a holiday.
- Adjusted the logic for business day and hour calculations to properly account for the input parameters, including holidays.

By applying these corrections, the function should now work correctly with the failing test case and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
