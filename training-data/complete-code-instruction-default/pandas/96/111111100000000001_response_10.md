The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):`. It seems that `next_bday` should be called as a function instead of as an attribute.

The bug's cause is that the `next_bday` attribute is mistakenly being called as a function in the `apply` method. This is causing an AttributeError because `next_bday` is not callable. The correct way to call it is `self.next_bday()`, treating it as a method of the class.

To fix the bug, the `next_bday` attribute should be called as a method of the class by adding parentheses `()`. This will ensure that the `next_bday` method is properly invoked and will not result in an AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # (rest of the code remains unchanged)
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):  # Fixed the method call by adding ()
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
                # (rest of the code remains unchanged)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
