The `apply` function from the pandas library in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is intended to apply custom business hours to a given datetime. The function is failing when being used with a frequency of `CustomBusinessHour`. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` produces a ValueError when using this frequency.

The main issue in the `apply` function seems to be related to the adjustments made to the `other` datetime when calculating the business hours and days. It appears that the adjustments for negative `n` values (representing past business hours) are not properly handling the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

To fix this issue, the adjustments need to be carefully reviewed to ensure they conform to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. Additionally, the adjustments for positive `n` values (representing future business hours) should also be reviewed to make sure they work correctly for the given frequency and edge cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function after considering the issues mentioned above:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._next_bday(is_on_offset)(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these changes, the corrected `apply` function should pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` without producing a ValueError.
