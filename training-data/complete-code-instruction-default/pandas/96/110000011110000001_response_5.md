The buggy function is a method `apply` within a class and is designed to adjust datetime objects based on a set of business hour rules. 

When analyzing the failing test function, `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, it is clear that it is testing the use of custom business hours and holidays to create a date range. The error message points to a frequency-related ValueError that is being raised when trying to validate the frequency with the passed values.

The potential error location within `apply` function is in the section where it calculates and adjusts the business days and remaining business hours. The error is likely to be caused by incorrect calculations leading to frequencies that are not compatible with the passed values.

To fix the bug, the section of the code that handles the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours should be double-checked to ensure the correct calculations are being made.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if other.time() in self.start:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if self.n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should pass the failing test.
