The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This function is called when a CustomBusinessHour frequency is used in a pandas `date_range` and results in a ValueError. The error message indicates that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency. This is likely due to incorrect adjustments made within the `apply` function that do not align with the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

To fix the bug, the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object within the `apply` function need to be revised to ensure that it aligns with the frequency specified using CustomBusinessHour.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # other functions remain the same

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            n = self.n
            freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)

            if n >= 0:
                other = pd.Timestamp(other, freq=freq)
            else:
                other = other - np.timedelta64(1, 's')
                other = pd.Timestamp(other, freq=freq)

            result = other + n * freq
            return pd.Timestamp(result, freq=freq)

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated code should address the issues with the previous version and align the adjustments made in the `apply` function with the CustomBusinessHour frequency.
