1. The buggy function is part of a class named BusinessHourMixin, which is a mixin for managing business hours. The function 'apply' takes another date and adjusts it to the next business day based on business hours. The GitHub issue is related to the behavior of pd.date_range when specifying periods and adding holidays.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the adjustment logic for handling the holidays and adjusting the date to the next business day.

3. The bug's cause is likely the incorrect calculation or adjustment of the date when holidays are specified, resulting in more periods being generated than expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include reviewing the logic for handling holidays, adjusting the date to the next business day, and ensuring that the correct number of periods are calculated and returned.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # Other functions from the same class

    # Corrected version of the apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Check if the date is a holiday
            if other in self.holidays:
                return self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                return self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the apply function now checks if the specified date is a holiday and adjusts it accordingly. The adjustment logic has been simplified to handle holidays and the next business day more effectively. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub problem statement.
