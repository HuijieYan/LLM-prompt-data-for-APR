The issue in the given buggy function is that it is trying to access `self.n` without defining it in the class. The potential error is within the section where `n = self.n` is used, as `self.n` is not defined anywhere.

The bug's cause is due to the missing definition of `self.n` in the class. The related functions being called within the buggy function are `self._is_on_offset(other)`, `self._next_opening_time(other)`, `self._get_closing_time(other)`, `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)`, `self._prev_opening_time(other)`, and other related functions.

To fix the bug, we need to define `self.n` in the class to be used in the buggy function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    self.n = 0  # Define self.n

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def next_bday(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _next_opening_time(self, other, sign=1):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _prev_opening_time(self, other):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _get_business_hours_by_sec(self, start, end):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _get_closing_time(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def is_on_offset(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _is_on_offset(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This is the corrected buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n  # now defined in the class

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to the previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # rest of the code remains the same
            # ...
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected code, `self.n` is defined as 0 in the class `BusinessHourMixin`, which allows it to be used in the `apply` function.
