The buggy function `apply` is causing the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail. The error message shows a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation.

The potential error in the `apply` function is the incorrect handling of business hours, which can lead to an incorrect calculation of the expected result.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Check the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours to ensure it accurately accounts for the business hours.
2. Correct the way the business hours are adjusted based on the business day and remaining hours.
3. Ensure that the frequency and time intervals are correctly calculated to align with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # other function declarations remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            if n >= 0:  
                next_opening = other if other.time() in self.start else self._next_opening_time(other)

                while n > 0:
                    next_closing = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)
                    time_within_interval = (next_closing - next_opening).total_seconds()

                    if n >= time_within_interval / 60:
                        n -= time_within_interval / 60
                        next_opening = self._next_opening_time(next_closing)
                    else:
                        next_opening += timedelta(minutes=n)
                        n = 0

                return next_opening
            else:
                prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other) if other.time() in self.end else self._get_closing_time(other)
                while n < 0:
                    curr_opening = self._next_opening_time(prev_opening)

                    if curr_opening.date() == prev_opening.date():
                        closing_to_opening = (curr_opening - self._get_closing_time(prev_opening)).total_seconds()
                        if abs(n) >= closing_to_opening / 60:
                            n += closing_to_opening / 60
                            prev_opening = curr_opening
                        else:
                            prev_opening -= timedelta(minutes=abs(n))
                            n = 0
                    else:
                        prev_opening = curr_opening
                        n += 1

                return prev_opening
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code should resolve the issues related to business hours and frequency validation, and it should make the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` pass.
