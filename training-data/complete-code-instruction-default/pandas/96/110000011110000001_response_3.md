The error is occurring during the use of the CustomBusinessHour offset, which is not compatible with the logic in the original function. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the CustomBusinessHour offset and the adjustments made in the apply function. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH, which points to a discrepancy between the frequency inferred from the input values and the expected CustomBusinessHour frequency.

The bug is likely caused by the implementation of the apply function, which does not properly handle the CustomBusinessHour offset when making adjustments to the input datetime values. The logic in the function seems to be overly complex and does not account for the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

To fix the bug, the apply function should be modified to handle the CustomBusinessHour offset appropriately. This may involve adjusting the conditional statements and business hour calculations to account for the specific behavior of the CustomBusinessHour offset.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        return self.apply_offset(other)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
