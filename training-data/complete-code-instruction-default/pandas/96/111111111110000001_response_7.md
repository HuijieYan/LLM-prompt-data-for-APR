The buggy function is `apply` which is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is referencing several other functions from the same class, such as `_get_closing_time`, `_next_opening_time`, and `_get_business_hours_by_sec`. The failing test is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from the file `test_date_range.py`, and the error message indicates a ValueError related to the frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the logic for adjusting the datetime in the `apply` function. The function attempts to adjust the datetime based on business hours, but it seems to be encountering an issue related to the frequency of the datetime, leading to a ValueError.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the frequency and adjustment logic for business hours within the `apply` function. This could be due to incorrect calculations related to business hours or improper validation of the frequency.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the logic for the adjustments made in the `apply` function and ensure that it properly accounts for the frequency and business hours. Additionally, it may be necessary to validate the frequency in a more robust manner to avoid the ValueError that is being raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        freq = other.freq
        if freq and isinstance(freq, pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour):
            # adjust other based on the custom business hour frequency
            business_hour = freq
            return business_hour.rollforward(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected code simplifies the logic for applying the custom business hour frequency to the datetime and ensures that it properly handles the frequency. This should address the ValueError and make the function pass the failing test.
