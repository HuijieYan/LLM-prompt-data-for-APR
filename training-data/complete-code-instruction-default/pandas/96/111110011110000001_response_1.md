The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is used to apply business hours to a given datetime. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is designed to test the custom business hours functionality, specifically with the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The failing test is expecting a specific set of datetimes based on the defined custom business hours, but the test fails with a ValueError indicating that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

The potential error in the `apply` function seems to be the logic used to adjust the datetime based on the business hours. It appears that the adjustment logic for handling positive and negative business hours is causing the failure, particularly related to the adjustment of the `other` datetime variable.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to review the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime within the `apply` function. The adjustments for positive and negative business hours need to be thoroughly examined to ensure that the correct business hours are applied to the given datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # other methods remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust the timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
            n = self.n
            freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)  # create CustomBusinessHour frequency

            # Adjust datetime based on business hours
            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    other = freq.rollforward(other)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    other = freq.rollback(other)
                    n += 1
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected code simplifies the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the provided business hours. It utilizes the `rollforward` and `rollback` methods of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency to accurately adjust the datetime according to the specified positive or negative business hours. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
