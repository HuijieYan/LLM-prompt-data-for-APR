The buggy function `apply` is trying to adjust business hours based on the given `other` value and a set of business hour rules. However, the error message indicates that there is an issue with the frequency validation for the `CustomBusinessHour`. Additionally, the failing test is related to `pd.date_range` and checking if the given frequency is valid.

The potential error location is within the logic that manipulates the `other` datetime to adjust the business hours. It seems that the adjustment logic might not be handling the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency correctly, leading to the frequency validation error.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` value are compatible with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        freq = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(
            start=self.start, 
            end=self.end, 
            holidays=self.holidays
        )

        result = pd.date_range(
            start=other, 
            periods=1, 
            freq=freq, 
            closed=None
        )

        return result[0]
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This code adjusts the `other` datetime value using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency directly by creating a new `CustomBusinessHour` object with the appropriate parameters and then using `pd.date_range` to generate the adjusted datetime based on the frequency. This ensures that the frequency validation is handled correctly.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass.
