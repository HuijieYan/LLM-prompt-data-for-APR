# The buggy function is designed to adjust a datetime object by a certain number of business hours. However, there are several potential error locations within the function such as incorrect datetime calculations, potential infinite loops, and potential issues with the business day calculations.

# The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect calculations of business hours, incorrect adjustments for positive or negative business days, and potential infinite loops in the while loops.

# Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
# 1. Correcting the business hour calculations to ensure accurate adjustments
# 2. Ensuring the correct adjustments for positive or negative business days
# 3. Eliminating potential infinite loops in the while loops by carefully handling the logic
# 4. Check for potential edge cases and handle them appropriately

# Here's the corrected code:
