The buggy function `apply` is related to the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The error message indicates a value error in the method `_validate_frequency` of `DatetimeArray` in the pandas library. 

The bug causes the `pd.date_range` function to produce unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays with `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour`.

The problem likely lies in the logic for adjusting the business hours when holidays are involved. This leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated when holidays are present, as observed in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business hours while accounting for holidays needs to be thoroughly reviewed and modified. One approach could involve a more comprehensive handling of the holiday dates within the `apply` function, ensuring that the periods generated are correct even in the presence of holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code remains unchanged)

        # handle the case where other is a holiday date
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            # adjust to the next business day
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # ... (existing code remains unchanged)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected `apply` function, we've added a specific check for holidays and adjusted the `other` date to the next business day if it falls on a holiday. This modification ensures that the periods generated by `pd.date_range` are correct when holidays are involved.

This corrected version of the `apply` function should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue. It handles the business hours and holidays more accurately, ensuring that `pd.date_range` works as expected in the presence of holidays.
