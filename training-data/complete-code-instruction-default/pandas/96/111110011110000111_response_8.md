1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be causing the issue. When the `pd.date_range` function is used with `CustomBusinessHour` and holidays, it produces more periods than expected.

2. The potential error location within the `apply` function could be in the logic for adjusting the datetime `other` based on the business hours and holidays.

3. The bug's cause is that the `apply` function is not correctly handling the adjustments for holidays, resulting in more periods than expected in the `pd.date_range` output. This is leading to a ValueError being raised when validating the frequency of the date range.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a). Reviewing the holiday adjustment logic in the `apply` function to ensure it correctly adjusts the datetime `other` when holidays are present.
   (b). Checking the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours to ensure it handles holidays appropriately.
   (c). Refactoring the adjustment logic to account for holidays and maintain the expected number of periods in the date range.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # rest of the code remains the same

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if other in pd.to_datetime(self.holidays):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    if other in pd.to_datetime(self.holidays):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            # rest of the code remains the same

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the adjustment logic for holidays has been added to ensure that the `other` datetime is correctly adjusted when holidays are present. This will help in aligning the dates with the expected number of periods in the date range and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
