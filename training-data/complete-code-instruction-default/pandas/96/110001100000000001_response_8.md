The potential error location within the problematic function is in the lines of code that handle the adjustment of the datetime for business hours. 

The bug's cause is the incorrect adjustment of the datetime for business hours, which is causing the function to produce incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the datetime adjustment logic needs to be revised to ensure that the adjustment for business hours is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def apply_wraps(func):
    pass

class BusinessDay:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n

# this is the corrected code
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start = self.start
        end = self.end

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n < 0:
            n *= -1

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(start, end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
