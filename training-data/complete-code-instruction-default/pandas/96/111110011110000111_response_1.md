1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be causing the error. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses the `pd.date_range()` function with a custom business hour frequency, and it fails with a `ValueError` related to the frequency not conforming to the expected frequency. The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem with the `pd.date_range()` function when using periods and adding holidays.

2. The potential error location within the `apply` function could be in the logic that handles adjusting the datetime based on business hours, holidays, and weekends.

3. The bug may be caused by an issue in the adjustment of the datetime based on business hours and holidays. The failing test uses a custom business hour with a specific start time and a holiday, and the bug surfaces during the adjustment of datetime values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review and revise the logic responsible for adjusting the datetime based on business hours, holidays, and weekends.
   - Ensure that the adjustments correctly handle holidays and do not produce more periods than expected.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    # ... (other class methods)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
                tzinfo=other.tzinfo
            )
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other based on business hours and holidays
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for handling the `other` datetime, this corrected code aims to resolve the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue. The adjustments made in the `apply` function are focused on correctly handling business hours, holidays, and weekends, ensuring that the `pd.date_range()` function works as expected.
