The potential error in the buggy function is caused by the incorrect sequence of operations and the improper handling of different conditions. The `apply` function is meant to adjust the datetime `other` by a specified number of business days and business hours. However, there are several issues in the code, such as the mishandling of negative business days, incorrect calculation of remaining business hours, and the incorrect adjustment of the `other` datetime.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be taken:
1. Ensure proper handling of positive and negative business days
2. Correctly calculate the remaining business hours and adjust the datetime accordingly
3. Handle edge cases and boundary conditions appropriately

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # other functions remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            total_minutes = businesshours // 60
            n = self.n
            if n < 0:
                total_minutes = -total_minutes

            days, minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_minutes)

            if n < 0:
                days = -days
                minutes = -minutes

            if days != 0:
                business_day_offset = self.next_bday(other) - other
                remaining_minutes = minutes + days * total_minutes
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other + business_day_offset)
            else:
                remaining_minutes = minutes
                adjusted_time = other

            while remaining_minutes != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    business_time_left = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    ) - adjusted_time
                else:
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    business_time_left = next_opening - adjusted_time

                if abs(business_time_left.seconds // 60) <= abs(remaining_minutes):
                    adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)
                    remaining_minutes -= abs(business_time_left.seconds // 60)
                else:
                    adjusted_time += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                    remaining_minutes = 0

            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
