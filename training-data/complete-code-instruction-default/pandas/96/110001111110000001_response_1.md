It seems that the buggy function is not handling the CustomBusinessHour frequency correctly, which is causing the ValueError in the failing test.

The problem appears to be in the `apply` function. This function is supposed to adjust a given datetime `other` based on the business hours defined in `self`. However, it seems to be mishandling the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, resulting in an incorrect adjustment which leads to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic of the `apply` function and ensure that it handles the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that should fix the bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other += pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, holidays=self.holidays)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other -= pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, holidays=self.holidays)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that the adjustment of `other` based on the business hours defined in `self` is handled correctly, including the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. This should address the problem and allow the failing test to pass.
