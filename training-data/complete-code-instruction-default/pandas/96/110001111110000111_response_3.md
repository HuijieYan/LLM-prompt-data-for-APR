The buggy function `apply` from the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is causing the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail with a `ValueError`. The test is expecting a `DatetimeIndex` with 4 periods, but it's receiving a `DatetimeIndex` with 26 periods instead. This discrepancy is likely due to the logic within the `apply` function, as it handles adjusting business hours and days.

The root cause of the bug seems to be in the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours. The function is not correctly handling adjustments when there are holidays present, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the resulting `DatetimeIndex`.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `apply` function needs to be reviewed and potentially rewritten to handle holidays properly and ensure that the correct number of periods is returned.

The corrected version of the `apply` function is presented below:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# ... (other functions remain unchanged)

# Corrected apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)  # setting time to midnight
        n = self.n

        # handle holidays
        holiday = pd.to_datetime(self.holidays)
        if other in holiday:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # ... (the remaining logic remains unchanged)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code:
- We added logic to handle holidays by checking if the `other` date is in the list of holidays, and adjusting it accordingly.
- The remaining logic remains unchanged.

This corrected function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case.
