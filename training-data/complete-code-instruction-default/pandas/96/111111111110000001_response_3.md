The problem here is that the `CustomBusinessHour` object is not being handled properly in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This leads to an error when trying to use the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in the `pd.date_range`.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` method is not equipped to handle the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency object.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `apply` method to properly handle the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency object. We can do this by adding a conditional check to handle the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency separately from other cases.

Below is the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other methods remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, (datetime, pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour)):
            if isinstance(other, datetime):
                # logic for handling datetime objects
                # ...
            else:  # handle CustomBusinessHour
                result = pd.Timestamp(other + self.n * pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour())
                return result
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code includes a conditional check to handle the `CustomBusinessHour` separately. If the input `other` is an instance of `CustomBusinessHour`, the `apply` method creates a new timestamp using the specified `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

With this correction, the `apply` method should now properly handle the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and pass the failing test.
