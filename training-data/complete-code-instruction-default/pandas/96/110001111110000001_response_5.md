The buggy function seems to be related to business hour calculation and adjustment. The `CustomBusinessHour` function is part of the pandas library, and it is used to create a custom offset representing a business hour.

The failing test is attempting to use the `CustomBusinessHour` to generate a date range, but it is failing with a ValueError related to the frequency validation.

The bug is likely related to the way the business hour calculation and adjustment is being done in the `apply` function. It seems that the adjustment logic is not correctly handling the cases where the business hour is not in line with the offset frequency, leading to the ValueError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the business hour in the `apply` function needs to be reviewed and potentially rewritten. The adjustment logic should correctly handle cases where the business hour is not aligned with the offset frequency, and it should ensure that the date range is generated correctly.

```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        # adjust by business days first
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=n * 60)

        # handle cases where the business hour is not aligned with the offset frequency
        if bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
            if n < 0:
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0) and not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    bhour_remain += pd.Timedelta(minutes=60)
                    
            else:
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0) and not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour_remain -= pd.Timedelta(minutes=60)

        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The fixed code introduces changes to handle the adjustment of business hours and aligning them with the offset frequency. The adjustment logic has been updated to correctly handle cases where the business hour is not aligned with the offset frequency.

These changes should resolve the ValueError in the failing test and ensure that the `apply` function correctly generates the date range using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.
