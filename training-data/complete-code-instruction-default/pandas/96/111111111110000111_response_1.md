The buggy function `apply` has an issue with adjusting the `other` date when `n >= 0`. It incorrectly adjusts the `other` date in cases where it should not, leading to incorrect results.

The implemented logic to adjust the `other` date seems flawed and is likely the cause of the issue described in the failing test and GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the `other` date needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the conditionals for adjusting the `other` date based on `n` should be handled with more precision.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin:

    # other class methods...

    # This is the fixed version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # some code...

            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other + timedelta(days=1)
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            # remaining code...
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected code for the `apply` function, the failing test should pass successfully, and the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved.
