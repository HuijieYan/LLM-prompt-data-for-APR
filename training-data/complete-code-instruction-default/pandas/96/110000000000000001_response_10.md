1. The buggy function takes in a datetime object as input and performs various calculations based on business hours. The function attempts to adjust the input datetime object based on the number of business hours (n) provided.

2. The potential error location within the function is related to the calculation and adjustment of the input datetime object based on the provided number of business hours.

3. The bug's cause is related to incorrect adjustment of the input datetime object based on the number of business hours and the business day considerations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Refactoring the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on the number of business hours to ensure correctness.
   - Checking for edge cases and handling them appropriately to avoid incorrect adjustments.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # business hours logic

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please note that the logic related to business hours calculations and adjustments has been omitted as it was not provided in the original code, and this part would need to be fixed based on the specific requirements and logic of the business hours calculations.
