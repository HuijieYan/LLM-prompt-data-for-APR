Potential Error:
The potential error in the buggy function is that the function is not handling certain conditions properly, and the logic for adjusting the business hours and business days is complex and could lead to incorrect results.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by improper handling of business days and business hours adjustment. There are multiple conditions and calculations to handle business days and business hours, and any mistake in these calculations can result in incorrect output.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Simplify the logic for adjusting business days and business hours.
2. Use datetime library functions more effectively to handle time adjustments.
3. Break down the complex logic into smaller, more manageable parts.
4. Ensure proper handling of edge cases and conditions.

Corrected Code:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    n = self.n

    working_hours = (self.end - self.start).total_seconds() / 60
    working_days = 1 if working_hours == 0 else abs(n) // (working_hours / 60)
    remaining_minutes = abs(n) % (working_hours / 60) if working_hours != 0 else 0

    if n < 0:
        working_days *= -1
        remaining_minutes *= -1

    result = other + timedelta(days=working_days)
    result = self._get_closing_time(self.start) if result.time() in self.start else result
    result = self._next_opening_time(result) if result.time() not in self.end else result

    while remaining_minutes != 0:
        next_opening = self._next_opening_time(result)

        if n >= 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(result)) - result
            if remaining_minutes < bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                result += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                remaining_minutes = 0
            else:
                remaining_minutes -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                result = self._next_opening_time(next_opening)
        else:
            bhour = next_opening - result
            if remaining_minutes > bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                result += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                remaining_minutes = 0
            else:
                remaining_minutes -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                result = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(result) - timedelta(seconds=1))

    return result
