1. The buggy function is used to adjust datetime objects based on business hours. The GitHub issue is related to using date_range with periods and adding holidays, which is resulting in an unexpected behavior.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays, which may not be handling the cases with holidays correctly.

3. (a) The buggy function takes a datetime object and adjusts it based on business hours, but it seems to have issues when handling holidays.

   (b) The GitHub issue mentions that when using date_range with periods and adding holidays, it produces more periods than expected. This indicates that there might be an issue in how the function handles holidays, resulting in incorrect adjustment of datetime objects.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the logic related to adjusting datetime objects and ensuring it correctly handles holidays.
   - Ensuring that the function considers holidays when calculating business hours and adjusts the datetime objects accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.holiday import AbstractHolidayCalendar
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class CustomBusinessHourWithHolidays(CustomBusinessHour):
    def __init__(self, start=None, holidays=None, **kwds):
        self.holidays = holidays
        super().__init__(start=start, **kwds)

    def apply(self, other):
        if self.holidays and other in self.holidays:
            return self.apply(self._apply_business_day_offset(other, 1))
        return super().apply(other)
        
# This can be used to create a frequency for pandas.date_range
cbh = CustomBusinessHourWithHolidays(start='10:00', holidays=[datetime(2020, 11, 26)])

# Now you can use cbh as the frequency while creating date_range
pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00', periods=14, freq=cbh)
```

This corrected code extends the CustomBusinessHour class to handle holidays and adjusts the datetime objects accordingly. It uses the apply method to check if a given date is a holiday, and if so, applies the business day offset to skip the holiday. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
