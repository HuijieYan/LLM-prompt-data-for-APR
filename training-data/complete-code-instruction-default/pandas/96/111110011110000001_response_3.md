The problematic function is `apply` which is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is expecting an output from the `apply` function, which is not being generated correctly due to the bug.

The potential error is in the `apply` function where the adjustment of the input `other` is not being handled properly. This leads to the incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours, resulting in an incorrect output that does not match the expected result in the test.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of business day adjustments and remaining business hours in the `apply` function. This misalignment causes the function to produce incorrect results, leading to the failure of the test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Correcting the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours in the `apply` function.
2. Ensure that the adjustment logic aligns with the expected behavior for business hours and days.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # other functions remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)

            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other, sign=1)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other, sign=-1)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd = self.n // len(self.start)
            r = self.n % len(self.start)

            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            remaining_seconds = (bd * business_hours + r * 60) * 60
            other += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code should address the issue with the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours, ensuring that the `apply` function produces the expected output for the failing test.
