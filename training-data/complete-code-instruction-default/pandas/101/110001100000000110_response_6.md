# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function

# this is the fixed function
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
        The desired data type for the array elements.
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An array with the elements cast to the given dtype.
