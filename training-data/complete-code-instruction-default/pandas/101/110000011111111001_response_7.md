The bug originates from the inability of the function to properly handle NaN (Not a Number) values when converting datetime or timedelta values to integers. The failing test is specifically designed to check the behavior of the function when converting 'NaT' (Not a Time) values to integers. The function throws a ValueError for these cases, as the function is unable to handle this specific conversion.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the conversion of 'NaT' values to integers, as specified in the failing test.

One approach to fixing the bug is to add a condition within the function to check for NaN or 'NaT' values and return the appropriate result without raising a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy import ndarray
from numpy import dtype
from numpy import timedelta64

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (other parts of the function)

    elif is_datetime64_dtype(arr) or is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if dtype == np.int64 and arr.item(0) != np.datetime64('NaT') and arr.item(0) != np.timedelta64('NaT'):
            return arr.view(dtype)
        else:
            return np.nan

    # ... (other parts of the function)
```

This correction includes a condition to check if the arr contains 'NaT' values, and if so, returns NaN without raising a ValueError. It also includes modification to the if statement's condition related to datetime/timedelta type, ensuring that the conversion is handled appropriately.
