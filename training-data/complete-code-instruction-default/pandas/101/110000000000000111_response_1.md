The buggy function is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The function is used for data type conversion in pandas and numpy arrays. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Don't cast categorical nan to int" is related to issues with converting categorical data with NaN values to integer, which results in unexpected negative integers.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it handles the conversion of categorical data to integers. This conversion does not properly handle NaN values, resulting in the unexpected negative values.

The bug is caused by the function's inability to correctly cast categorical data with NaN values to integers. This is evident from the GitHub issue description, where converting a categorical series with NaN values to integer results in unexpected negative values instead of NaN.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the conversion from categorical data to integers in a way that properly handles NaN values. This may involve checking for NaN values before casting and ensuring that NaN values are properly retained or converted to integer NaN values where applicable.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype or str
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not to skip NaN when casting as a string type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        # Convert categorical to integer, handling NaN values
        return arr.astype('Int64')

    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pd.api.types.pandas_dtype(dtype)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In the corrected code, we have added a specific condition to handle the conversion of categorical data to integers. If the input array is a categorical data type and the desired dtype is an integer type, it will use the new nullable integer type 'Int64' for the conversion, ensuring that NaN values are correctly handled.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that converting categorical data with NaN values to integers produces the expected results.
