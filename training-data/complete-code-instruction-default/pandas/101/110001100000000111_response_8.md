The issue seems to be related to the conversion of a categorical series back into an integer column resulting in NaN being incorrectly converted to a large negative integer. This is due to a bug in the `astype_nansafe` function in the file `pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py`.

The issue appears to be related to the handling of NaN values when casting a categorical series to an integer dtype. The function `lib.astype_str` seems to be converting NaN values to a large negative integer.

To fix the bug, the function `lib.astype_str` needs to be adjusted to handle NaN values in the categorical series without converting them to a large negative integer.

The corrected version of the code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py

# The following function is called by the buggy function
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # Adjust handling of NaN values when casting categorical series to an integer dtype
    elif is_categorical_dtype(arr.dtype) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected function addresses the issue described in the GitHub issue by handling the conversion of NaN values from a categorical series to an integer dtype correctly.
