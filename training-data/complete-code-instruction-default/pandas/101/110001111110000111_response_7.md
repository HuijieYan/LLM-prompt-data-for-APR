The potential error in the buggy function is that when casting from a categorical data type to an integer, NaN values are not handled correctly, leading to unexpected results.

The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` is trying to cast `NaN` values to integers and expecting a `ValueError` to be raised, but the buggy function does not raise the expected error.

The GitHub issue indicates that when converting categorical series back into an integer column, NaN values are converted into unexpected negative values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the conversion from categorical data type to integer in a way that correctly handles NaN values and raises an error when necessary.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if np.isnan(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle NaN values when casting from a categorical data type to an integer. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
