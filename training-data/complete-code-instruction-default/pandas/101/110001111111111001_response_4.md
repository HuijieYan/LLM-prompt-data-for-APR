The buggy function is `astype_nansafe` located in `pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py`. This function is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test is testing the function with `NaT` values and `int64` type. The test expects a `ValueError` to be raised, but the function does not raise it.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):` block. This block is supposed to check if the array dtype is floating and the desired dtype is integer, and if there are non-finite values in the array, it should raise a `ValueError`.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function is not correctly raising a `ValueError` when there are non-finite values in the array and the desired dtype is integer. Instead, it tries to convert the non-finite values to integer without raising an error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):` block to properly check for non-finite values and raise a `ValueError` if they are present.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer

    """

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

With this corrected code, the `astype_nansafe` function should now properly raise a `ValueError` when there are non-finite values in the array and the desired dtype is integer. This should make the function pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
