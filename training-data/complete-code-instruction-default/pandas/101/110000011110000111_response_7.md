The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is meant to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` is used to evaluate the function, and it is failing with a ValueError indicating that "NaT" values cannot be converted to an integer. 

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not handle NaN values properly when casting to integer data types. This is evident from the failing test, as well as the issue posted on GitHub titled "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs". The issue describes how converting a categorical series with NaN values to an integer type results in unexpected negative integer values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle NaN values when casting to integer data types. This involves adding a check for NaN values and converting them to NaN in the target data type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pytest

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """
    
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and np.isnan(arr).any():
        return arr.astype('float').astype(dtype)
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The corrected function includes an additional check for the presence of NaN values when casting to integer data types. If NaN values are present in the array and the target dtype is an integer type, it converts the array to float and then to the target integer type to handle NaN values properly.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass, and the issue described in the GitHub post "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" should also be resolved.
